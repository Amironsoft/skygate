15-25-2-097 	 prediction of course stability of towed offshore structures by computational fluid dynamics |the purpose of this research is to find practical methods to predict the course stability of towed offshore structures at the initial design stage  the equilibrium yaw angles of a towed floating production storage and offloading (fpso) with a single skeg and twin skegs are predicted by a drift model test and a computational fluid dynamics (cfd) analysis  the results are compared with the towing model test results  additionally, cfd towing simulations are performed and validated, and the mechanism of instability is analyzed through an investigation of physical quantities obtained from the cfd simulations  |introduction |the demand for offshore structures such as floating production storage and offloadings (fpsos) and semi-submersibles has increased in order to develop offshore oil and gas fields  offshore structures constructed at shipyards should be transported safely to the oil fields  they are generally towed by several tugboats and towing lines  defined as whether the towed offshore structure follows the desired course of the tugboats, the course stability is one of the indices for safe transportation  if the course stability is not secured enough, it will be difficult to keep the course, and eventually the overall transportation may fail in the worst case  if the transportation fails, the risk of collision with other vessels or geographic features increases, which may lead to damage to the towed offshore structure or even a catastrophic oil spill  |governed by the submerged hull form, the hydrodynamic characteristics can change the course stability  in other words, transportation safety starts from the design stage of the hull form  therefore, the prediction of the course stability is one of the most important aspects of the design and engineering of offshore projects  much research has been done on the prediction of the course stability  strandhagen et al  (1950) investigated the course stability criteria for the towed vessels using the routh-hurwitz stability criterion  bernitsas and kekridis (1985) suggested the discriminant using characteristic equations derived from the equations of motion of the towed vessel  |as of now, the prediction of the course stability of towed vessels at the design stage heavily depends on the model tests in marine industries  latorre (1988) investigated the scale effect on the course stability of towed barges  he found that the model resistance was larger than the full-scale resistance  on the basis of his findings, he indicated that the model barge might overesti mate the course stability compared to the full-scale barge due to the scale effect  you (2000) carried out the towing model tests for a tanker ship and an fpso  he found that the fpso achieved better course stability than the tanker  jung et al  (2005) performed the towing model tests to investigate the bow shape effect on the course stability of fpsos  two different types of bow shapes were tested: a barge bow shape and a spoon bow shape  it was found that the barge bow shape obtained better course stability than the spoon bow shape  yang and hong (2006) carried out extensive towing model tests for different stern hull shapes, skegs, and bilge radii for an fpso  kwon (2007) performed the towing model tests for the forward blocks of container ships and tankers  the towing model tests showed that the container blocks were towed with a fishtailing motion  yang et al  (2011) investigated the interactions between a tugboat, tow lines, and a towed vessel through two different modelings of tugboats, in which the fpso model was directly towed by a carriage and towed by a free-sailing tug model  |as previously mentioned, the model test is widely used for its reliability, but there are many limitations such as time, cost, measurements, and test facilities  it is also extremely difficult to redesign the hull form after the model test by reason of the poor course stability since the basic design is nearly finished at the model test stage  more importantly, it is difficult to understand the resulting instability with limited data from the model test | 
15-25-3-170 	 sloshing assessment of flng cargo containment system due to sloshing loads in bimodal seas: effect of wave intensity |sloshing is liquid movement in a container excited by motion  the sloshing flow becomes more violent and results in an intense liquid impact as the excitation period gets closer to the resonance period of the internal liquid  this sloshing impact is the most critical load component in the structural design of a liquefied natural gas (lng) cargo containment system (ccs) of an lng carrier or floating liquefied natural gas (flng)  in this study, the structural assessment of sloshing loads was performed for a two-row mark iii membrane-type ccs of an flng  the ccs was designed to be installed in a gas field in northwestern australia where the wind-sea and swell components were simultaneously measured  two distinct sea states of special interest were considered for the structural analysis  one included sea states on the contour line corresponding to a 100-year return period in a wave scatter diagram  these sea states are usually used for the prediction of the extreme motions of floaters and are termed extreme sea states  the other included sea states with a high probability of occurrence  these sea states are used for investigating the effect of long-term exposure to sloshing loads on ccs structures  an evaluation of the structural safety of the ccs and hull structures was conducted by the use of a sequence of computational fluid dynamics (cfd)-based scenario screenings, sloshing model tests, and statistical fittings of utilization ratios (urs)  it was found that all probable sea states had to be fully considered when the screening for the sloshing assessment was performed  even though the sea states with a high probability of occurrence had smaller significant wave heights than the extreme sea states, they might cause the largest sloshing loads and structural responses  |introduction |the new global energy strategy is gradually focusing on natural gas due to economic benefits from conventional petroleum resources  a number of offshore gas reservoirs, which were uninteresting in the past, are now being commercialized, and as a result, new floating liquefied natural gas (flng) development projects related to natural gas production are being executed  in the case of flngs, it is not possible to impose restrictions on the filling level of the liquefied natural gas cargo during continuous operation; thus, significantly violent sloshing phenomena can occur  this is in contrast to lng carriers that operate under restricted filling conditions  therefore, the sloshing resistance of an flng ccs and the adjacent hull structure is one of the most important design parameters for the structural safety of an flng  with respect to the structural design, it is not easy to determine the design sloshing loads absolutely because the lng sloshing is a highly nonlinear impact phenomenon  although the model tests can measure the impact pressure, the direct use of the measured pressures in the design is still controversial due to uncertainty regarding the scale effects and cryogenic characteristics  this is why the common practice is to comparatively assess the structural capacities of the ccs of a target vessel and those of a reference vessel, which is proposed by classification societies (abs, 2006; bv, 2011a, 2011b; dnv, 2006) | 
15-25-3-185 	 cfd simulation of bow and stern slamming on a container ship in random waves |slamming is a common phenomenon as a ship navigates in rough seas, and it can cause severe structural damage to the hull structure  full-domain computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulation of random wave and structure interaction is considered impractical by many researchers  simplified approaches are usually adopted to alleviate expensive cfd random wave simulation  in this paper, we present a rigorous methodology that solves the navier–stokes equations entirely without any need for matching  in our simulation scenario, a container ship cruising at a constant speed is allowed to heave and pitch in random waves  both head-sea bow slamming at a speed of 6 knots and following-sea stern slamming at 0 and 5 knots are studied  irregular waves are used to simulate a realistic seaway environment  a very effective procedure is developed to capture the desired waves at a specific part of the sailing vessel  a level-set function is employed to capture the violent free surface and to simulate the interaction of the random wave and the ship  this rigorous navier–stokes numerical approach is able to capture complex mechanisms and show results that are possible only with cfd simulations, thus providing useful information for ship designs  |introduction |research on ship maneuvering and sea-keeping is conventionally done with potential flow codes  though the practice enjoys quick results and low computational costs, it is incapable of treating some critical events like green water, breaking waves, and extreme slamming  for these relatively short-term extreme scenarios, it is logical to perform computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulation based on more realistic physics, although it becomes substantially more expensive in the complex setup preparation and longer computational time  green water and slamming on ships and offshore structures have long been problems causing great concern and generating many studies  in rough seas, a vessel’s bow and stern may occasionally emerge from seawater and reenter it with a heavy impact  the vessel experiences high-pressure impact loads between the vessel’s hull and water surface  these impact loads are of a transient nature and can cause serious structural damage  severe green water may also affect the stability of the ship and cause considerable structural damage  it is thus important to estimate the magnitude of the impact loads and the peak pressure for structural design purposes  cfd simulation of slamming phenomena is challenging  due to the transient nature of slamming, a simulation in the time domain requires a time increment sufficiently small to capture the peak impact pressure  this makes the computation very time consuming  both the large motion of the vessel and the violent free surface must be solved accurately for a realistic wave–structure interaction  simulating and capturing the desired irregular wave for a cruising ship add another level of difficulty  full-domain cfd simulation of random wave and structure interaction has been deemed impractical by many researchers  regular waves are commonly substituted in the case of a ship with forward speed |

15-25-4-299 	 geomechanical characteristics of gneiss in antarctica determined by freeze-thaw tests |freeze–thaw tests were performed on gneiss samples collected from terra nova, antarctica, in order to examine and compare the properties of rocks that were slightly weathered (sw) and moderately weathered (mw)  the tests were conducted under temperatures ranging from -20 ± 2°c to 20 ± 2°c  a cycle of testing consisted of 5 h of freezing followed by another 5 h of thawing under full saturation with water  in this paper, a total of 200 cycles of the freeze–thaw test were performed and were followed by measurements of porosity, absorption, ultrasonic velocity, and shore hardness per each 20 cycles, with uniaxial compressive strength (ucs) determined every 50 cycles  the strength of the sw rocks decreased by approximately 0 07 mpa per single cycle, while that of mw rocks decreased by approximately 0 19 mpa per single cycle  during the 200 cycles of sw rocks, the absorption increased from 0 23% to 0 39% and the p-wave velocity decreased from 4,227 m/s to 3,596 m/s  similarly, those of mw rocks changed from 0 65% to 1 6% and from 3,751 m/s to 2,877 m/s  in conclusion, it was inferred that the properties of sw rocks that experienced approximately 200–300 cycles of freeze–thaw became close to those of mw rocks  |introduction |as freeze–thaw of rock is greatly dependent on surrounding weather, weather and rock characteristics need to be considered to identify the weathering mechanism of rock in freeze–thaw processes  rock exposed to extremely cold environments, like the environment of antarctica, remains frozen all year round, and thus it is necessary to test the rock while it is in a frozen state to identify its structural characteristics  bortz et al  (1993) suggested correlations between rocks (limestone, granite, and marble) tested at the natural state and artificial weathering conditions  when it comes to marble, 12–16 cycles of the described treatment are considered to be equivalent to one year of natural weathering, and structural changes were determined after 300 cycles for granite, 500 cycles for marble, and 200 cycles for limestone  measuring the properties of rock frozen at the climatic condition of the antarctic showed that moisture evaporation occurred from saturated frozen rock  nicholson and nicholson (2000) showed the strength degradation that occurred through applying the freeze–thaw test to 10 kinds of sedimentary rock  the saturation state of the sample could not be identified because the sample was simply submerged without considering evaporation |

170830-pa 	 permeability of organic-rich shale |summary |measured permeability of an organic-rich shale sample varies significantly with applied laboratory conditions, such as the confining pressure, temperature, and the measurement fluid type  this indicates that the measured quantity is influenced by several mechanisms that add complexity to the measurement  the complexity is mainly caused by stress dependence of the matrix permeability  also, it is because organic-rich shale holds significant volumes of fluids in sorbed (adsorbed, dissolved) states; sorption can also influence the permeability through its own storage and transport mechanisms  the stress-dependence and sorption effects on permeability could develop under the reservoir conditions and influence the production, although we currently do not have a predictive permeability model that considers their coexistence  |in this work, this is accomplished by considering that the shale matrix consists of multiple continua with organic and inorganic pores  stress dependency of the permeability comes along with slit-shaped pores, whereas the sorption effects are associated with nanscale organic capillaries  a simple conceptual flow model with an apparent shale permeability is developed that couples the molecular-transport effects of the sorbed phase with the stress dependence of the slit-shaped pores  the simulation results show the impact of the permeability model on the production  |sensitivity analysis on the new permeability model shows that the stress dependence of the overall transport is significant at high pore pressure, when the effective stress is relatively low  diffusive molecular transport of the sorbed phase becomes important as the stress gets larger and, hence, the slit-shaped pores close  the constructed apparent-permeability vs  pore-pressure curves show the dominance of the molecular transport as an increase in permeability characterized by appearance of a minimum permeability value at the intermediate values of the pressure  one can use the new permeability model easily in history matching a well performance and optimizing its production | 
170867-pa 	 an evidence-based approach to well-integrity risk management |summary |the paris basin (france) is a particularly challenging setting for oil production: besides lying under a metropolis of 12-million people, it is also exploited for low-temperature geothermal energy and is crossed by a deep, high-quality drinking-water aquifer of strategic importance, the albian-neocomian  vermilion, the biggest producer in the area, undertook in 2012 a basinwide well-integrity risk-management project with the goal of understanding and minimizing the risk of freshwater-aquifer pollution  the paris basin operations include 20 fields, for a total of 289 active wells, more than half of which were drilled in the 1980s  the objectives of the leakage risk assessment are two-fold: first, identify high-risk scenarios and "must act" wells that require immediate intervention; second, adopt lean (i e , eliminating waste) prevention and mitigation measures that satisfy the local regulator  the risk-assessment methodology is based on scenarios (i e , ways in which the hazards, brines or hydrocarbons, can cause damage to targets, the freshwater aquifers)  each scenario involves the failure of a number of barriers with the function to prevent or mitigate damage  in this approach, evidence from in-depth failure analysis is used to build and calibrate scenarios, as well as to validate degradation mechanisms and understand their dynamics  evidence considered is not limited to drilling reports and wireline logs, but includes all observations, measurements, and weak signals that one can use to test assumptions on the presence, absence, or aging of well integrity  evidence-based scenarios are complemented by known failure mechanisms, thus reducing the risk of "black swans," very improbable but catastrophic events, even though their probability is constrained by observed behavior during the 4,000 well years of operations in the basin  the criticality (product of probability and severity) of each applicable scenario is then computed by use of an exhaustive database of the characteristics of each well, resulting in a complete risk profile for the basin  the risk-assessment process revealed that casing corrosion caused by brine injection is the biggest driver of well-integrity risk; it also allowed tailoring effective prevention and mitigation actions: for instance, the criticality of scenarios is reduced to an acceptable level if the time between tubing failure and injection stop is kept to 3 months or less  furthermore, the analysis helps define the role of periodic logging and thus reduce possible waste (i e , actions that do not contribute to understanding, preventing, or mitigating risk)  the evidence-based approach, since applied to another french basin, has proved effective for managing risk at the basin level, by cutting a middle way between universal checklists and the excessively narrow focus of well-by-well analysis: the former are too large and hazy and may hide real dangers among hardly applicable generalities, whereas the latter tends to be expensive and unsystematic and misses recurring patterns  heavy-duty analytics and modeling are used most efficiently on focused and specific failure analyses to understand the dominant phenomena, which one can then use to paint a quantitative and consistent picture at the level of a field or basin | 
171030-pa 	 time-dependent initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures in a formation with varying stresses and strength |summary |the premise of classical hydraulic-fracture-breakdown models is that hydraulic-fracture growth can only start when the wellbore pressure reaches a critical value that is sufficient to overcome the tensile strength of the rock  however, rocks are well-known to exhibit static fatigue; that is, delayed failure at stresses less than the tensile strength  in this paper, we explore the consequences of delayed failure on axially oriented initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures  specifically, given a certain breakdown pressure, we investigate the conditions under which subsequent hydraulic fracture(s) can begin within the time frame of a stimulation treatment in regions of higher stress and/or strength because of delayed-failure mechanisms  the results show that wells completed in shallower formations are more sensitive to variations in strength, whereas wells completed in deeper formations are more sensitive to variations in stress  furthermore, cases in which all hydraulic fractures break down according to the same pressurization regime--that is, all are "fast" (nonfluid-penetrating) pressurization or else all are "slow" (uniformly pressurized fluid-penetrating) pressurization cases--are highly sensitive to small stress/strength variability  on the other hand, if the first hydraulic-fracture initiation is in the "fast"-pressurization regime and subsequent fracture(s) are in the "slow"-pressurization regime, then the system is robust to a much-higher degree of variability in stress/strength  practically, this work implies that methods aimed at moderately reducing the variability in stress/strength among the possible initiation points (i e , perforation clusters) within a particular stage can have a strong effect on whether multiple hydraulic fractures will begin  in addition, this analysis implies that pumping strategies that encourage "fast," nonpenetrative breakdown of the first initiation point followed by the opportunity for fluid-penetrating, "slow" breakdown of subsequent initiation points could be effective at encouraging multiple-hydraulic-fracture initiation |

173000-pa 	 development of a novel method to evaluate well integrity during co2 underground storage |summary |a safe and ecologic underground storage of carbon dioxide (co2) requires long-term integrity of the wells affected by the injected co2, including both active wells and abandoned wells  in line with other investigators, technical integrity is assumed if there is no significant leak in the subsurface system from the storage reservoir  the evaluation of integrity of abandoned wells over a long time frame during co2 underground storage can only be performed indirectly and requires a comprehensive understanding of relevant thermal/hydraulic/mechanical/chemical processes affecting well integrity  this paper presents an integrated approach coupling qualitative features, events, and processes (feps) and scenario analysis with quantitative-model development and consequence analysis  the qualitative analysis provides a solid and comprehensive study on all the feps that affect well integrity  the mechanical model presents the stress distribution of the casing/cement/rock composite system and provides a quantification of the defect dimension caused by different load conditions  the defect dimension can be used to compute equivalent permeability of the cement sheath by use of empirical correlations, which is an important input parameter for the following co2-leakage simulation, provided it is considered that co2 can only migrate through the defects instead of the cement matrix  when integrity is compromised, the storage reservoir will leak co2  for this leakage, a numerical model is presented to simulate the flow of co2 along abandoned wellbores during the storage period, such as 1,000 years  it is found from the fep analysis that the most-critical system components are caprock, casing/cement/rock composite system, and abandonment elements  by building a geomechanical model and a leakage model, it is also found that in the simulated scenarios the co2-leakage rate is very small except for when using cement sheaths of very poor quality, which can lead to a leakage rate exceeding the maximum-allowable value  the sensitivity analysis shows that the vertical permeability of the cement sheath plays the most critical role  in comparison with previous studies, this method is comprehensive and easy to implement |

174086-pa 	 the continuous-scratch profile: a high-resolution strength log for geomechanical and petrophysical characterization of rocks |summary |knowledge of rock properties is essential to predict and optimize the performance of oil and gas reservoirs by means of the reduction of the uncertainty pertaining to standard subsurface issues such as the mechanical integrity of the borehole (tiab and donaldson 1996; moos et al  2003), the risk of sanding (tronvoll et al  2004), and the geometry and efficiency of hydraulic fractures  these properties are evaluated by combining different field measurement techniques (wireline logs, results of well tests, seismic surveys) and laboratory-test results (archie 1942, 1950; serra 1986; bassiouni 1994)  when cores are available, empirical models are built from correlations derived between well logs and laboratory measurements to estimate rock properties in noncored wells  the validity of these empirical models is often limited to specific lithofacies (see reviews by chang et al  2006; blasingame 2008; khaksar et al  2009), which makes the identification of lithofacies a necessity before applying the model for predictions in uncored wells (massonnat 1999)  because of the heterogeneity of rocks (haldorsen 1996), with characteristic length scales commonly smaller than the resolution of wireline logs or even the core-plug size, the robustness of correlations is determined by how plug samples capture the dispersion in rock properties over the lithofacies under consideration  the correlation between a very localized core-plug measurement and a low-resolution wireline log with inherent low-pass filtering properties raises issues related to the upscaling of a property from one length scale (few centimeters for core plugs) to another (up to 1 m for wireline log)  as an illustration, consider the high-resolution, continuous profile x, where the variations of the measured property are quantified for length scales smaller than typical plug sizes  we filter this data to produce the profiles x5 and x50 (the subscript stands for the length scale in centimeters at which the signal is averaged out) with lower spatial resolutions similar to the plug and the well-log resolutions, respectively (fig  1)  the resulting crossplot, shown in fig  2, of x5 vs  x50 exhibits a cloud of points in which the dispersion is governed by the properties of the signal (the degree of heterogeneity or the frequency content) and the difference between the two resolution length scales  two linear-fit optimizations were carried out with the lowresolution-data x50 and the high-resolution-data x5 as the dependent variables, respectively  it is interesting to note that these linear fits yield different results, with a slope of 0 96 in the first case and 0 69 in the second case  this is a mathematical artifact caused by the minimization process inherent in the search for the best linear fit, which is most commonly a minimization of the vertical distance between the representative data points and the best-fit line  on the basis of this result, it should always be advisable to select the high-resolution data (plug) as the dependent variable  discrete sampling (i e , plugging) and the dispersion caused by the difference in resolution scales of two measurements are two important root causes of the errors often seen in correlations between two variables  the examples shown in fig  2 illustrate how the correlations derived from several sampling schemes can deviate from the expected one-to-one relation between the two variables  to circumvent these issues, petrophysicists usually select large quantities of plugs to build representative statistical data sets, with the hope that they are large enough to attenuate the effects listed previously |

174226-ms 	 characterization and development of deep carbonaceous shales: a north kuwait case study |abstract  objectives/scope   unconventional organic-rich carbonaceous shale (ocs) in north kuwait has unique characteristics due to its high total organic content (12–14%), its complex mineralogy (blend of carbonates and clastics) and jurassic/post-jurassic complex burial and tectonic history  the ocs is under/over-laid by tight carbonates, where the system permeability is in the range of nano to micro-darcy  conventional techniques to initiate flow from this complex reservoir have proven ineffective, which led the appraisal team to develop novel and extensive workflows to characterize the formation properties for successful hydraulic fracturing and to determine the commercial flow potential of hydrocarbons    methods, procedures, process   three vertical wells were identified as the high potential candidates in the appraisal program, prior to the completion of horizontals in this complex formation  a comprehensive logging suite was acquired which included spectroscopy, sonic and image logs  fracture pressure analysis was performed on an offset well followed by exhaustive diagnostic tests using both non-viscous and viscous fluids  bottom hole gauges were hanged in the well during the diagnostic tests as well as temperature logging was performed after the diagnostic pumping to define fracture height growth/containment  proppant fracturing in these wells are planned using nonradioactive tracer proppant    results, observations, conclusions   maximum clay content in the ocs is estimated close to 40% in addition to the high organic content  anisotropic mechanical earth model was built using sonic log response for fracture modelling in planar 3-d simulators  some open fractures were observed from the image logs  fracture pressure analysis on the offset well confirmed "fraccability" of the ocs within the allowable pressure limits  analysis of the diagnostic tests confirmed significant impact of natural fracture on hydraulic fracture propagation  nolte-smith plot using actual bottom-hole pressure revealed very high net pressure slope during viscous fluid stages that raised significant concerns on possibility of placing proppant  interventions after the diagnostic tests showed flowback of formation material in the form of "formation creep" into the wellbore and that lead to concerns on formation integrity and risks in proppant placement    novel/additive information   this paper discusses various methods used to understand the complex ocs formation and integrates extensive analysis achieved through different methods  interpretation of this data-set and building a model which will be used for development of future horizontal wells will also be presented  it is believed that the inherent challenges presented by the ocs are unique without any true global analogues in the unconventional gas and oil programs | 
174227-ms 	 indentaion hardness for improved proppant embedment prediction in shale formations |abstract   the aim of hydraulic fracturing is the generation and maintenance of highly permeable pathways  to achieve this, a high hydraulic pressure is applied to overcome the breakdown pressure in developed formations  to avoid the closure of the generated fractures due to the acting in-situ stress in the subsurface, proppantsareused  the hydraulic conductivity (cf) of such a fracture is defined as the permeability of the proppant pack (kpr) times the fracture width (wf)  however, this value cannot be considered a constant  the increasing effective pressure leads to an increased stress on the proppants, thus increasing their embedment into the formation surface  such a situation becomes particularly critical in weak formations and in formations where the interaction between the frac fluid and the formation can lead to a change in the mechanical properties in the fracture face  this paper will present an approach to model the embedment of various kinds of proppant packs with respect to the proppant size distribution and the proppant density  this approach uses the indentation hardness of the surface formation to calculate the embedment  the advantage of this parameter, which can be measured by applying the hardness test according to brinell, is that it describes the mechanical properties of the surface of the formation  this area, which is highly influenced by the treatment fluid, can show great differences in the mechanical behavior compared to the untreated area  this can lead to an under- or overestimation of the embedment, since the mechanical parameters normally used for calculation are measured on core samples representing the mechanical behaviour of the untreated rock mass  the consideration of the indentation hardness can lead to a more accurate embedment prediction, since it describes the behaviour of the first 0 1-2 mm of a surface, in which the embedment alone can lead to a closure of a fracture  the first series of hardness tests according to brinell, conducted on different shale types, have proven that the fluid composition affects the indentation hardness of the samples, which will of course affect the depth of the embedment  the measurements are the basis for the embedment modelling which will be presented in this article |

174232-ms 	 pressure behavior and fracture development during polymer injection in a heavy oil saturated unconsolidated sand |abstract   polymer injection into unconsolidated sand-packs saturated with either brine or model medium-heavy oil was investigated using a bore-hole simulator (bhs)  the high-pressure vessel of this apparatus enables fluid injection under radial or spherical flow regimes into porous specimens having diameter 40 cm and height up to 60 cm and at typical reservoir axial and radial stresses, i e  up to 40 and 60 mpa respectively  we found that injectivity into heavy oil saturated sand-pack drops steeply to a minimum and then increases again rapidly before leveling off to a plateau  this behavior is in stark contrast with water or polymer injection into water saturated sand-packs, where constant injectivity is established after a rather short transient increase  the behavior of polymer injection into the oil saturated sand-pack strongly supports the idea of the stimulation of the near-wellbore area even though post-mortem visual observations of the porous sample it did not reveal open hydraulic fractures |

175029-ms 	 analysis of drawdown sensitivity in shale reservoirs using coupled-geomechanics models |abstract   productivity loss in some shale reservoirs is often attributed geomechanics-related factors, even when the exact mechanism(s) is undetermined  overpressured reservoirs tend to experience a large increase in effective stress during depletion, which can contribute to a dramatic loss in fracture conductivity  factors such as a low elastic modulus may also contribute to productivity loss through processes such as proppant embedment  the haynesville shale (texas and louisiana) is often cited as an example of geomechanics-related productivity loss since it is characterized by high overpressure (1 0 psi/ft in some areas) resulting in extremely high initial production rates followed by steep declines    in this study, a simplified, single-fracture coupled model with different orientations relative to the principal stresses is used to investigate the impact of drawdown management on estimated ultimate recovery (eur)  the coupled-geomechanics reservoir simulation model was constructed using a comprehensive set of logs, rock mechanics tests and fracture conductivity measurements from a shale reservoir  in particular, various drawdown schedules (bottomhole pressure vs  time) and their effect on effective stress on the fractures were compared  subsequently, fracture conductivity (fc) relationships considering the maximum effective stress for each drawdown scenario were constructed and used in traditional (non-coupled) reservoir simulations to forecast gas eur    it was found that a managed drawdown schedule can improve eur by up to 15%, mainly by reducing the effective stress on unpropped fracture regions  importantly, the modelling results show that unpropped fracture "pinch points" near the wellbore may lead to very significant reduction in overall recovery  model results showed that even proppant concentrations around 0 3 lb/ft2 maintained sufficient conductivity to not hamper well productivity in nanodarcy reservoirs  traditional reservoir simulation approaches using compaction tables (pore pressure vs  fc) lack the critical process of stress path dependency that governs the effective stress on the fractures and is necessary to adequately model this system    future experimental work should be directed at measuring unpropped fracture conductivity at high stresses and longer durations (creep) as unpropped fractures appear to be a main contributor to the observed geomechanical-related productivity loss |

175043-ms 	 a multi-pass procedure for redistributing linearized mass balance errors to improve simulator performance |abstract   in a generalized reservoir simulator for compositional and black oil models, the primary governing equations are mass conservation equations and volume balance equations with pressure and component masses as the primary unknowns  the phase equilibrium is honored in the calculation of partial volume derivatives  the newton-raphson method is widely chosen to solve this non-linear system: the equations are first linearized then solved using direct or iterative linear solvers  direct solvers are not practical for large systems; therefore, iterative solvers are used  iterative solvers are not exact and are usually converged to a specified criterion  the stricter the criterion, the higher the computational effort required by the linear solver  on the other hand, a loose convergence criterion can lead to more newton iterations or false physical solutions    in addition to the convergence tolerances for linear solvers, certain criteria must be applied to the non-linear newton iterations  one of the main convergence criteria is that the volume error at any gridblock is less than a small fraction of its pore volume  the linear solver tolerance should be somehow related to this non-linear tolerance, or the linear solutions should be adjusted to help the convergence of the non-linear iterations  because of the limited accuracy of iterative linear solvers, a two-pass procedure is proposed to improve the linear solutions by redistributing linearized mass balance errors  in the first step, all the gridblocks are divided into different groups according to whether the mass change is positive or negative and by the magnitude of contribution to local fluid volume change  then a constrained optimization problem is defined and solved to adjust the linear solutions, satisfying global mass conservation  with these modified solutions, the linearized volume errors for all the gridblocks are calculated  in the second step, a criterion similar to the aforementioned volume convergence criterion for newton iteration is imposed on the linearized volume error for each gridblock  with reasonable linear solutions, most of the gridblocks should satisfy this criterion  for gridblocks that do not satisfy this condition, another constrained optimization problem is defined to ensure local volume balance with local mass solutions further adjusted  with this two-pass procedure, global mass conservation and local volume balance are achieved for the implicit formulation of the governing equations, with little or no degradation of the newton convergence, and usually without needing to tighten the linear solver convergence tolerances |

175137-ms 	 numerical study of production mechanisms and gas-oil ratio behavior of liquid-rich shale oil reservoirs |this paper summarizes our investigation of production mechanisms and well production performance in liquid-rich shale (lrs) oil wells and introduces a new methodology for modeling lrs oil well performance  it discusses the impact of nanopore confinement on pvt properties, transport properties, rock compaction, how these phenomena affect produced gor of lrs oil wells, and how to incorporate these phenomena into reservoir modeling studies  |the proposed methodology has been applied to construct a compositional simulation model using a hydraulic fracture reservoir model with logarithmically-spaced local grid refinement (ls-lgr grids)  we incorporated the impact of nanopore confinement on phase behavior by using new correlations for modifying pvt properties in nanopores  the model was divided into three zones, hydraulic fracture, nanopores, and micro pores; each zone had different pvt, rock compaction and relative permeability properties  production data from several lrs oil wells in the eagle ford shale were used for history matching and model calibration  |our numerical model is able to simulate producing gor behavior of lrs oil wells accurately  the "flat" gor's in early stages of production are caused by delayed development of two-phase flow as a result of reduction of the bubble point pressure in nanopores  enhancement of critical gas saturation delays mobilization of gas molecules in nanopores and could extend non-intuitive gor behavior further when reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point  we found that the impact of permeability reduction due to compaction on ultimate oil recovery could be more than 20%  the study reveals that the period of constant produced gor depends on the volatility of the reservoir fluid and on the pore size distribution in the reservoir  for moderate-gor oil reservoirs, the constant gor duration is greater than for highly volatile oil reservoirs  |several unique phenomena in lrs oil reservoirs were explored in this study  as a result, we were able to introduce new correlations for modifying bulk pvt properties under confinement  these new correlations and the effects of nanopores can be combined with numerical models to simulate the performance of lrs oil reservoirs and to estimate eur more accurately  |we concluded that numerical models with pvt model based on fluid bulk properties are not able to accurately simulate unconventional lrs oil reservoir fluid flow  confinement impact on pvt and rock-fluid property of nanopores play key roles in complex production behavior of these resources  we also concluded that, for numerical models to capture accurately fluid distribution and compositional variability in nano darcy lrs oil reservoirs, it is necessary to have correct knowledge of pore/pore throat size distributions in the reservoir | 
175139-ms 	 addressing forecasting non-uniqueness and uncertainty in unconventional reservoir systems using experimental design |abstract   model-based production analysis using analytical or numerical models is not a new phenomenon and is considered a robust technique for analyzing and forecasting production data; however, its application to unconventional reservoir systems often proves problematic due to model non-uniqueness resulting from long-term transient flow regimes  this non-uniqueness, an unavoidable fact when analyzing inverse problems, is worsened by the uncertainty surrounding input model parameters when attempting to describe reservoir systems with a great deal of complexity (e g  very low permeability, geomechanical effects, near-critical fluids, natural fracturing, etc )  the problem facing the engineer presents itself when different combinations of input parameters yield nearly identical history matches but very different time-rate profiles and estimated ultimate recovery (eur) values when forecasting future production for a particular well    a systematic framework that covers the full range of uncertainty for all relevant input parameters would clearly mitigate the ambiguity of production analysis and forecasting under uncertain conditions  in this work it is proposed that experimental design, which is a statistical technique used to describe or optimize a process by systematically analyzing the effect of the various controllable and uncontrollable factors of a system on an output (e g  eur), can provide such a framework  in this work, a methodology combining model-based production analysis with experimental design is used to history match and forecast fractured vertical and multi-fractured horizontal oil wells in the vaca muerta shale with high-frequency time-rate-pressure data  the primary objectives of this work are to provide a comprehensive overview of the vaca muerta shale, outline experimental design as it relates to model-based production analysis, quantify uncertainties in model input parameters, and finally history match and forecast two wells that are producing in the vaca muerta shale | 
175154-ms 	 advances in flowback chemical analysis of gas shales |abstract   recently, flowback chemical analysis has been considered as a complementary approach for evaluating fracturing operations and characterizing reservoir properties  understanding the source of flowback salts and the mechanisms controlling the water chemistry is essential but also challenging due to the complexity of shale-water interactions  in this study, samples of flowback water and downhole shales are analyzed to investigate the mechanisms controlling the chemistry of flowback water    the water samples at different flowback times and the shale samples are collected from three wells completed in the muskwa, otter-park, and evie members of the horn river basin  the water samples consist of aqueous solution and precipitated salts  the water samples are digested in nitric acid to dissolve the precipitated salts, and are analyzed at both intact and acid-digested conditions using icp-ms  the flowback salts are weighted and analyzed using xrd and sem-edxs  a sequential ion-extraction is performed on the shale samples; and the extracted ions are categorized into three tiers of loosely-, moderately-, and strongly-attached ions    the concentration of monovalent cations in both intact and acid-digested samples is higher than that of divalent cations  also, the concentration of all cations is higher in the acid-digested samples compared with that in the intact samples  the ratio of divalent cations concentration in the acid-digested samples to that in the intact samples is higher than that for the monovalent cations  this ratio increases for the divalent cations over time, while it remains constant for the monovalent cations  additionally, for the acid-digested samples the monovalent cations concentration has an initial sharp increase followed by a slower increase at later flowback stages; while the divalent cations concentration increases continuously over time  these results suggest that the majority of the ions in the early flowback water are loosely-attached monovalent ions  these ions can be originated from the mixing with in-situ formation brine, dissolution of soluble precipitated salts, or leaching of exchangeable cations from the clay minerals  similarly, the role of relatively slow water-rock interactions (such as leaching of divalent exchangeable cations, e g  ca2+,) increases at the later flowback stages  xrd and sem-edxs analyzes of the flowback salts indicate that sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium carbonate are the major salts  the sequential ion-extraction reveals that the majority of the monovalent cations are in the loosely-attached tier  however, majority of the divalent cations are moderately- /strongly-attached to the rock  the strongly-attached portion of the ions is determined by acid digestion of the rock sample at the final stage of sequential extraction process  these strongly-attached ions cannot be easily released by hydraulic fracturing and therefore, has small effect on the flowback water chemistry |

175237-ms 	 a decade of self-sealing cement technology application to ensure long-term well integrity |abstract   recent studies have shown that more than 50% of wells that are 15 years old or older have at least one casing string with sustained casing pressure  cement sheath failure will result in sustained casing pressure, cross flow, lost production, collapsed casing, contaminated water zones and increased workover costs  today, us federal regulation do not allow wells with sustained annular pressure to be plugged and abandoned  remediation in these cases is both difficult and expensive  therefore, utilizing a cement formulation which repairs itself in case of any failure under downhole conditions would be ideal for ensuring long-term well integrity and preventing the occurrence of sustained casing pressure  the objective of this paper is to review the self-sealing cement technology presented in the literature  this study manifests the latest novel laboratory equipment which allowed the cement to cure, get cracked and then seal under downhole conditions  the hydrophilic essence of this material provides a durable cement sheath to help ensure well integrity and zonal isolation for the life of the well  mechanical properties testing could demonstrat the improved tensile to compressive strength ratio, lower young's modules and higher poisson's ratio  in addition, self sealing cement could self seal multiple times and therefore deliver a durable cement sheath in a wide variety of field cases |

175271-ms 	 innovative technology for multi-phase pumping |abstract   multi-phase pumps (msps) have been successfully used to accelerate production from wellheads and reduce well intervention costs  as multi-phase pumps are essentially hybrids of a pump and a compressor they face challenges from variations in gvf, changing flow conditions and from the gas-compression effect  msps can also be complex, have large capex/opex and consume a lot of power  surface jet pumps, innovatively combined with novel compact separation, provide a cost effective and simpler method for multi-phase pumping  surface jet pumps (sjps) are simple, low cost, passive devices that use a high pressure (hp) fluid as the motive force to boost the pressure of the lp well and deliver it for processing  the lp multi-phase flow is separated by a compact separator and the separated liquid pumped by a single phase pump while the gas is boosted by the surface jet pump  the power required to drive the single phase pump is a fraction of the power consumed by the multiphase pump  the high pressure fluid that is needed for the motive flow for the sjp can come from a hp well, the discharge of a compressor or from the export gas line  advantages of using sjps with compact separators include no moving parts, zero maintenance, zero power or fuel gas usage, small footprint and varying layout configurations  sjps are well suited to changes in process conditions, liquid ingestion and variations in gvf (without affecting performance)  this paper discusses the use of surface jet pumps and compact separators as an alternative to multi-phase pumps and cites several case studies of where this technology has been utilised  the design and operational criteria of sjps, as well as the economics are also highlighted   introduction   as oil and gas fields reach maturity, production becomes restricted for a variety of reasons such as increased water-cut and deterioration of the inflow characteristics of wells  if nothing is done, the low pressure wells will be loaded with liquids and seize production prematurely    multiphase pumps have been used successfully to boost production from low pressure oil wells  one of their benefits is that they can handle multiphase flow, a mixture of gas and liquids without the need to separate the two phases  multiphase pumps however consume big power as they need to boost the pressure of both gas and liquids  there is however an alternative solution in cases where a high pressure source is available    this paper describes the use of surface jet pumps (sjps) to revive oil and gas wells and prolong their production life  the challenge related to both oil and gas production is handling multiphase flow, a mixture of gas-oil and water by the boosting system  sjps are capable of handling multiphase flow similar to multiphase pumps, but selection of the sjp system depends on the available source of hp motive flow    the use of surface jet pumps (sjps) is one of the simplest and most cost effective ways to revive low pressure oil and gas wells, or boost production from such wells  a high pressure (hp) fluid is needed as the motive flow and the source of energy for the sjp  the paper describes the various solutions using the sjp system and provides some guidelines for selecting the best candidate lp wells  the paper also refers to several recent field examples    the economics of using the sjp system is very attractive and all field applications to date have shown the recovery of capital from the added revenue ranging from only ten days to a few months |

175346-ms 	 advanced geophysical techniques to optimize microseismic imaging of hydraulic fractures in saudi arabian unconventional resources |summary   successful production from unconventional reservoirs requires expensive hydraulic fracturing operations that are not only costly but pose environmental and health risks if not managed properly  optimized use of microseismic imaging is essential to control the hydraulic fracture operation, to minimize any possible environmental hazards introduced by fracturing, and to achieve cost efficiency    an integrated workflow that incorporates advanced geophysical techniques is presented in this paper to enhance microseismic imaging of hydraulic fracturing in unconventional resources in saudi arabia  the use of surface seismic attributes is suggested to primarily minimize location uncertainties of microseismic events; whether downhole or surface receivers arrays were used  secondly, coherence and edge attributes are used to highlight faults and seismic-scale fractures in seismic volumes, knowledge of which may favorably infer the "geomechanical" maximum horizontal stress direction; hence the main direction of fluid flow within targeted sediments and a preliminary conception of hydraulically induced fractures' direction of propagation  moreover, knowledge of fault networks in reservoirs is vital to pinpoint potential barriers that may impact the growth of fractures, and their likely geometries    seismic attributes are combined with acoustic impedance inversion volumes, vp/vs and poisson ratios to further enhance inferences to hydrocarbon bearing, and sediment brittleness  these methods can be used collectively to optimize multi-staged hydraulic fracturing of unconventional reservoirs, which will eventually lead to limiting stimulation to only selected "producible" sweet spots, thus minimizing the required number of "fracking" stages and associated environmental and financial concerns  these methods should also drive the use of more economic stimulation solutions using low-proppant, high-flow-rate, and water based treatments (gale, et  al , 2007) |

175565-ms 	 sourceless porosity and anisotropy while drilling using nuclear magnetic resonance and azimuthal acoustic lwd tools drilling technology: a case history |abstract   a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and azimuthal acoustic tools was recently run in a logging-while-drilling (lwd) tool combination  this tool combination was used for the first time in kuwait as a part of the bottomhole assembly (bha), in addition to conventional tools, to acquire porosity without using radioactive sources    a deviated 8 5-in  borehole section of a well was planned through sand-shale sequences with a borehole inclination ranging from 0 to 90°  this geological section is typically crucial from a borehole stability point of view  borehole deterioration and significant variations in pore pressure can create a high risk of becoming stuck-in-hole  the use of conventional porosity tools in a lwd bha with installed radioactive sources would significantly elevate the risks to an environmental-hazard level  and, even retrievable based sources become problematic for successful extraction in high angle wells    lwd nmr and azimuthal acoustic tools, free of radioactive sources, were run for the first time in a lwd tool combination, with the primary objective to measure porosity, pressure prediction, and possible anisotropy using a centralized four-axis acoustic caliper    previous experiences in the same geological setting encountered borehole enlargements by approximately 5 in  after only 15 to 16 hours  lwd helped bypass this issue and acquire high-quality data before borehole enlargement occurred  additionally, indications of the presence of possible rock anisotropy were observed  the results were then correlated and matched to offset well data as well as with existing field geomechanics knowledge    this paper presents the planning, design, and execution of using lwd nmr and azimuthal acoustic tools in this well  it also discusses the viability, integrity, and robustness of logged data as well as interpreted results  optimization of real-time drilling operations and petrophysical data acquisition requirements are also investigated to improve future field development and overall reservoir management strategies | 
175577-ms 	 uncertainty quantification of top structures in 3d geocellular models |abstract   building a stochastic structural 3d geocellular model for a reservoir in a new field is a challenge because of insufficient well data  structural heterogeneity due to folding, faulting and/or associated erosional unconformities may not be completely captured by low resolution seismic and limited well data  this could lead to significant structural uncertainty  hence, quantification of uncertainty capturing structural heterogeneity requires a comprehensive methodology incorporating seismic interpretation, well data and tectonic information  experimental discrepancies between predicted and measured depths of horizons in newly drilled wells reveal strong drift, which require a nonstationary model  the physical way to create such nonstationary model is by using numerical paleo-geomechanical deformation algorithms to reconstruct the folding phenomena (e g , finite elements)  such proposition requires a thorough understanding of rock parameters, and boundary conditions  another plausible alternative is to use nonstationary geostatistics, because it does not require boundary conditions, or rock deformation parameters  nevertheless, representing finite differences of order-k, which are required for geostatistical modeling, may be unachievable with insufficient well data  after revisiting the theoretical aspects of the problem, this paper shows a fast approach to quantify the structural uncertainty range for the depth of horizons accounting for spatial drift  the approach is illustrated with an example for a real clastic reservoir | 
175603-ms 	 detection of bedding corridors from open-hole logs in vertical wells and their impact on geomechanical assessment |abstract   bedding corridors are sub-horizontal tabular bodies of bedding plane weak zones formed as shear swarms, which vertically divide the entire reservoir thickness and extend laterally as their layers  bedding corridors are genetically related to shearing along the bedding planes and they contribute to the conductive systems in few abu dhabi reservoirs  they can be best identified from horizontal borehole image logs, and as spikes in open-hole logs  natural bedding corridors can be considered as indicators of the reservoir stress history, where they form extraordinary clusters of a huge number of quasi-parallel shear fractures in a transpressional regime    in many oil and gas reservoirs, natural bedding corridors networks help drain hydrocarbons and other fluids  the role of bedding corridors is particularly important in reservoirs having a tight matrix  in carbonate formations, for example, it is quite common to observe a permeability contrast of 1000md or more between the rock matrix and surrounding bedding corridors  in this paper we differentiate between image-log porosity and density-neutron porosity, which is regarded as secondary porosity attributable to fractures  we also introduce here a working hypothesis about their effect on hydrofraccing being part of geomechanical assessment    results indicate that the horizontal stress anisotropy (shmin/shmax ratio) is the key parameter to predict bedding corridors behavior under different stress regimes  swapping stresses with depth is common in abu dhabi fields, where a strike-slip regime can open and dilate the shear along the bedding planes  it is recommended to opt for horizontal wells hydrofraccing to maximize the intersection of those bedding corridors compared to vertical wells    the significance of this approach is that once a diagnostic signature can be recognized in open-hole logs, in combination with lost circulation data, it can be used to locate bedding corridors in other vertical wells with no image logs  geomechanically, these corridors can be used efficiently to increase production particularly in tight and unconventional reservoirs |

175735-ms 	 borehole stability and field stress analysis with azimuthal logging-while-drilling technology: a case history |abstract   real-time azimuthal acoustic measurements were introduced recently in the logging-while-drilling (lwd) industry  for the first time, this technology was used as part of the bottomhole assembly (bha) to acquire information related to principal stress orientations in the deltaic to marine zubair clastic sequence of onshore kuwait    a deviated 8 5-in  hole section of the well was planned through sand-shale sublayers with a borehole inclination ranging from 46 to 88°  this section is characterized by time sensitive borehole deterioration and significant variations in pore pressure  these factors result in severe hole instability and ultimately stuck pipe events and require relatively high mud weights to maintain wellbore stability  lwd azimuthal acoustic technology, free from chemical sources, was used for the first time both in drilling and wipe modes to facilitate time-lapse field stress and wellbore stability analysis    principal stress orientations were identified from three different sources, including borehole breakouts from azimuthal acoustic caliper, density image, and acoustic anisotropy evaluation  the results were then compared with the existing offset well data and an existing geomechanical 3d model  variations in observed stress orientation, seismic reflection pattern, and pressure history in offset wells were used to map a fault that is responsible for bypassed oil and for the occurrence of tar and gas  the interpretation was extended to other low throw strike-slip faults; additional fault compartments were identified that could affect the pressure maintenance scheme of the field    this paper discusses the planning, design, and use of lwd azimuthal acoustic technology in this case history well  it also describes the viability, integrity, and reliability of the interpreted results and their use in a detailed geological interpretation in terms of stress orientation, fault trapping, and areal fluid variation  the optimization of real-time drilling operations and petrophysical data acquisition requirements are also investigated to improve future field development and overall reservoir management strategies | 
175749-ms 	 the investigation of tight reservoir responses to induced hydraulic fracturing – with the use of analytical and numerical analysis |abstract   tight gas reservoir development has long been affected by 1) complex flow profiles and 2) the impact of very low permeability on reservoir productivity  where well tests (wt) buildup is very short, interpretation becomes difficult and results often are ambiguous  most wt of tight, dry gas wells are of short duration; thus, such tests typically lead to multiple interpretations and open-ended conclusions  adding to the complexity, simulation software packages often fail to adequately model flow in fracture networks    a series of well tests were conducted in tight sandstone, dry gas, naturally fractured reservoirs post-induced hydraulic fracturing  the tests were conducted for long durations: 100 hours in most cases, and 1,000 hours in two extended well-test cases  the wt responses from these tests were ambiguous    we have investigated possible direct causes of the ambiguous results, including wellbore, geology, and specific well conditions  however, because the wt response has been found repeatedly in a variety of regions around the world, it may not be related to any of these    after investigating in multiple manners, including the use of simulation software, we argue that the anomalies in the wt response may reflect a step in the scale-dependent properties of the fracture network |

175907-ms 	 characterization of anisotropic elastic moduli and stress for unconventional reservoirs using laboratory static and dynamic geomechanical data |abstract   in a vertically transverse isotropic (vti) medium, accurate prediction of the vertical and horizontal young's moduli (e) and poisson's ratios (?) is crucial to predicting minimum horizontal stress (shmin) and hence selecting drilling mud, cement weights, and perforation locations  fully characterizing geomechanical properties of vti shale requires five independent stiffness coefficients: c33, c44, c66, c11, and c13  in a vertical well, c33 and c44 are directly calculated from the velocity of the vertically propagating p- and s- waves, while c66 is estimated from the stoneley wave velocity  to obtain c11 and c13, an empirical model must be employed  this study integrates laboratory mechanical and sonic measurements to evaluate the annie and modified-annie models and extend the dynamic-to-static conversion equation    laboratory static and dynamic geomechanical methods were applied to multiple core materials extracted at different depths from a target shale play  the dynamic elastic moduli were measured using a laboratory sonic scanner; velocities were measured in different directions to obtain c33, c44, c11, c66, and c13  the dynamic data were then applied in the annie and modified-annie models for estimating the dynamic elastic moduli, including dynamic young's modulus and poisson's ratio  the static elastic moduli were measured using axial compression experiments; horizontal and vertical core plugs were tested to account for anisotropy    static and dynamic results illustrated horizontal young's moduli were predominantly higher than vertical young's moduli, which suggested a horizontal layered structure  vertical poisson's ratios can be greater or smaller than horizontal poisson's ratios, which is consistent with the prediction of the modified-annie model  conversely, the annie model always predicts ?(vert) = ?(horz)  static and dynamic data illustrated the anisotropic shmin was predominantly higher than the isotropic shmin  this implied that using an isotropic model to predict laminated shale will underestimate shmin  it was noticed that the static young's modulus increased with decreasing porosity for the target interval  the elastic moduli measured from the dynamic method were consistently higher than those measured from the static method  the dynamic and static data were used to fit the widely-used dynamic-to-static conversion equations—the canady and morales equations  the canady equation was extended to the "very hard" (greater than 70 gpa young's modulus) regime, while the morales equation was extended to the regime of porosity < 10%  finally, shmin predicted by different models was compared with the measurements, showing that modified-annie improved the prediction by solving the stress underestimation issue of the annie and isotropic models |

175910-ms 	 guidelines for the handling of natural fractures and faults in hydraulically stimulated resource plays |abstract   do fractures help or hinder production in hydraulically stimulated resource plays? most say they help, but some say they hinder  after monitoring productivity for over 10 years in a number of plays in shell's unconventional portfolio, it appears that the evidence for fractures helping is more conceptual than empirical, further substantiated by a detailed literature review  the objective of this paper therefore is to bring some objectivity to the discussion around the impact of structure using logical arguments by reason, incorporating knowledge of the variability in structure and well performance within the spectrum of unconventional plays    fundamental to this assessment is the recognition that different scales of features will have a markedly different impact  and to communicate the concepts herein, small-scale features are referred to as "natural fractures" and large-scale features, referred to as "faults" or "lineaments"    this analysis indicates that the variability in (small-scale) natural fracture intensity across most plays is not sufficient to be detected in well performance metrics, given the other sub-surface heterogeneity and the large range in estimated ultimate recovery (eur) for any given set of wells  furthermore, natural fracture connectivity is typically low and stimulation of networks is not supported by data or trials  it is proposed to consider natural fractures as an intrinsic rock property which will modify the bulk geomechanical properties of the formation  the only exception found was for folded tight-sand plays, where fracture network connectivity may be sufficient to provide a measurable enhanced deliverability    understanding the impact of seismically-visible, planar, structural features (e g  faults or lineaments) proved to be more problematic, with operators reporting both eur increases and decreases  this inconsistency is explained with a novel concept classifying faults as contained or uncontained, contingent on whether they are within a closed fluid- and pressure-contained system, or not (respectively) before and after hydraulic stimulation    rather than searching for a production performance correlation, it is suggested that an enhanced understanding of the physical processes during a hydraulic stimulation would be more beneficial to clarify the impact of structure  and to this aim, a compilation of potential fracturing diagnostics is presented herein | 
175920-ms 	 improving hydrocarbon recovery of horizontal shale wells through refracturing |abstract   the learning curve has evolved in the last few years for operators in shale plays  early wells started with relatively large cluster spacing and small proppant volumes resulting in suboptimal initial completions  over the years, perforation cluster spacing has declined  consequently, the number of hydraulic fracturing stages has increased  the total proppant pumped per lateral foot has also increased  the majority of the existing wells were completed with geometrically spaced multiple perforation clusters per stage  sometimes more than six clusters per stage have been employed  studies have shown that one-third of these perforation clusters are not productive (miller et al , 2011)  noncontributing perforation clusters could be due to not initiating hydraulic fractures, insufficient proppant placement, or loss of near-wellbore connection due to over-flushing or severe drawdown  furthermore, during the development phase, the depletion from parent wells leads to asymmetric hydraulic fracture growth on closely spaced infill wells  parent wells may also be negatively impacted due to hydraulic fracture interference from new completions  these factors have led to poor hydrocarbon recovery factors, sometimes less than 10% in horizontal shale wells    recovery factors from existing wells can be improved through restimulation  candidate selection is a key in achieving economically successful restimulation  restimulation of appropriate horizontal shale wells resulted in significant production uplifts based on early field results  designing a fit-for-purpose restimulation treatment is dependent on initial completion, offset well distance, infill plan, and, above all, economics  on top of the design aspect, operationally achieving effective restimulation on long horizontal wells with tens of perforation clusters is a challenging task  thus real-time monitoring and control is a key for field execution    this work uses an integrated petrophysical, geomechanical, hydraulic fracture, and reservoir modeling workflow and field observations to develop restimulation strategies for improving hydrocarbon recovery  this integrated workflow includes a multistep calibration process to reduce uncertainty  one of the key calibration steps is to model hydraulic fracture growth accounting for local geological heterogeneity and match with observed treatment parameters and microseismic interpretations  another critical calibration step includes automatic gridding of hydraulic fracture geometry to run numerical reservoir simulation to match realized production results  reservoir pressure distribution at the end of the production history is used to recalculate stresses for modeling the refracturing scenarios    multiple practical refracturing scenarios were constructed for addressing near-wellbore connectivity issues and ineffective drainage along the lateral  creating new surface area in undrained rock and restoring productivity of existing hydraulic fractures resulted in higher recovery  higher proppant amounts in undrained rock on one well pad or laterals with wider well spacing improved recovery  however, larger jobs can lead to significant interference for closely spaced wells  in conclusion, this paper demonstrates that properly designed restimulation treatments lead to improved recovery | 
175921-ms 	 growth of fractured zone around hydraulic fracture |abstract   propagation of fractures, hydraulic fractures included, is accompanied by growth of a certain process zone or "crack layer" around the fracture  this process or hydraulically fractured zone (hfz) can be either smaller or larger depending on the properties of formation  the goal of this paper is to determine how the extent of hfz depends both on rock properties and operational parameters as well  a better understanding of the hfz is important because growth of hydraulically fractured zone can significantly increase permeability adjacent to the fracture leading to improved hydrocarbon production  more energy is required to induce an hfz than just creating the main hydraulic fracture itself but a larger extent of hfz leads to lower elastic energy for the same cumulative volume of pumped fluid  in order to adequately describe the entire hydraulic fracturing process, all main energy contributions should be taken into account  traditionally, in using linear elastic fracture mechanics (lefm) to model the hydraulic fracturing process we would predict creation of large planar fracture or even fractures without considering the possibility of developing an hfz around the main hydraulic fracture  in this paper, a new description of hydraulic fracturing based on the least action principle, is proposed to appropriately account for the potential development of an hfz  since hydraulic fracture for unconventional resource is induced by injection of large volume of fracturing fluid into tight rock formations, it is therefore convenient to formulate the model in the rice-cleary framework where "undrained" rock parameters are used  elastic interaction of the hydraulically fractured zone with surrounding rock is described using eshelby inclusion approach  it can be demonstrated that when the model is applied to the propagation of a single hydraulic fracture, the model reduces to the conventional (geertsma-de klerk) regime of fracture growth  as a result, the extent of the hydraulically fractured zone and its permeability can be expressed in terms of rock properties and key operational parameters (e g  pumping rate, etc )  validity of this model will require further work, especially in the laboratory experimental arena as well as analysis of field observations | 
175927-ms 	 enhance hydraulic fractured coalbed methane recovery by thermal stimulation |coalbed methane (cbm) is becoming a significant portion of the us gas resource and is gaining importance in australia, china, indonesia and europe  cbm reserves in the united states are estimated at some 450 tscf  in australia, cbm resources exceed 300 tscf, while china has a resource potential greater than the united states and australia combined  recent advances in well design and production technology offer scope to significantly increase the proportion of gas contained in coal that can be commercialized  generally, initial water saturation is 100% within coal seams and gas can only be found as an adsorbed phase inside the coal matrix, so how much adsorbed gas can be released at an economical rate will determine the ultimate gas recovery  the langmuir isotherm has been widely used in industry to describe the pressure dependence of adsorbed gas  however, temperature dependent adsorption behavior and its major implications for evaluating thermal stimulation as a recovery method for coalbed methane have not been thoroughly explored  therefore in order to investigate the feasibility of thermal treatment in coal bed methane reservoir successfully, it is crucial to understand the effects of thermal stimulation on the adsorption and desorption phenomenon, and how can we exploit such effects to enhance coalbed methane recovery from hydraulically fractured reservoirs  |in this study, we propose a method to evaluate desorbed gas as a function of pressure and temperature in coal seams, by regression on langmuir isotherm data  in addition, a cbm reservoir simulator is developed, which is capable of capturing real gas diffusion in the coal matrix and flow in the hydraulic fractures, as well as the heat transfer process within the matrix  this simulator enables us to investigate various thermal stimulation techniques on the global well performance and recovery  |the results of this study show that by increasing the formation temperature, ultimate gas recovery can be improved in cbm reservoirs  the higher the thermal stimulation treatment temperature, the more extra gas can be recovered  however, the efficiency of thermal stimulation is mostly constrained by how much the formation area/volume that can be stimulated in a reasonable period of time  due to the low heat conductivity of coal, it is not possible to heat up a large drainage area/volume by heating the surface of vertical hydraulic fractures directly  if the heating source (e g , electromagnetically excited nano-particles) can be dispersed further into the formation through the cleat system during hydraulic fracture execution, then larger formation area/volume can be heated up, depending on how further the nano-particles can be pushed and the arrangement of production (injection) wells  in the case of horizontal fractures, a large formation volume can be thermally stimulated if the fractures can be placed close enough to cover the whole lateral area  thermal stimulation by hot water/steam injection can increase formation temperature more rapidly than direct element heating methods, especially when the formation permeability is large  considering large amount of residual adsorption gas still left behind even with low production pressure, thermal stimulation has the potential to enhance cbm recovery substantially if techniques and designs are tailored to the formation properties appropriately |

175933-ms 	 understanding fracture geometry of the canadian horn river shale gas via an unconventional complex fracture propagation model in multi-staged pad with 9 horizontal wells |abstract   hydraulic fracturing in shale gas reservoirs has often resulted in complex fracture network growth, as evidenced by microseismic monitoring  the nature and degree of fracture complexity must be clearly understood to optimize stimulation design and completion strategy  unfortunately, the existing single planar fracture models used in the industry today are not able to simulate complex fracture networks    a recently developed unconventional complex fracture propagation model is able to simulate complex fracture network propagation in a formation with pre-existing natural fractures  multiple fracture branches can propagate simultaneously and intersect/cross each other  this paper presents an integrated operator, non-operator and service provider's approach to optimize future hydraulic fracture design by fully integrating all the data captured in the canadian horn river shale    based upon insight from the study, which was initiated by the non-operator, continued by the operator and supported by the service provider in two different countries, the operator and non-operator needed to make more informed design decisions and understand the interaction between the shale, the hydraulic and pre-existing natural fracture network and reduce costs    data were captured from reference vertical wells and a multi-well pad  the data incorporated into the study included geophysical, geological, petrophysical, geomechanical and engineering such as dfit (small volume of water pumped into target formation) derived fracture closure pressure, production and pressure data from the horizontal wells in the pad  a generation of 2d natural fracture network is also included in the paper by defining natural fracture parameters such as length, orientation, spacing, friction coefficient, cohesion, and toughness which are almost entirely validated using lab data and geomechanical interpretation    the complex hydraulic fracture simulation results calibrated with microseismic and fracturing treatment data were incorporated into a shale gas, numerical simulator and further calibrated with current production history of the candidate multi-wells  the results of the hydraulic fracture, natural fracture and reservoir models were utilized to understand the fracture propagation mechanism in the canadian horn river shale gas formation    as a result of the project, the team is now able to run different hydraulic fracture design scenarios and assess the impact that each key design parameter has over the candidate well's long term production using a numerical simulator with a unique gridding process  based on these findings, the operator and non-operator now have an insightful tool that could be used as the building block for future optimization of the fracture design| 
175941-ms 	 parameters affecting load recovery and oil breakthrough time after hydraulic fracturing in tight oil wells |abstract   after hydraulic fracture treatment, wells typically produce significant volumes of water, which is primarily recovered fracturing fluid  the amount of fracturing fluid produced back is called load recovery  single phase water production may continue for several days before oil breakthrough from the formation occurs  a wide range of load recoveries (15%–80%) are reported in the literature, depending on various reservoir, fracture, pumping and operational parameters  this study conducts a comprehensive numerical and statistical analysis to identify the most important parameters affecting load recovery  the sensitivity of oil breakthrough time to these parameters is also investigated    a fit-for-purpose model was created using a commercial coupled reservoir flow/geomechanics simulator to simulate fracturing treatment and flowback operations  water and oil production trends, and flow regimes observed in the model, are verified using rate-transient analysis (rta)  the effect of twenty parameters including pumping rate, shut-in time, producing bottomhole pressure, production rate constraint, matrix porosity and permeability, matrix and hydraulic fracture compressibility, relative permeability end points and capillary pressure on load recovery and oil breakthrough time is investigated by utilizing design of experiment (doe)  the developed model considers non-uniform leak-off during pumping, providing a better understating of water retention, while the application of the doe method allows the effect of various parameters and their interaction to be studied rigorously    a critical finding is that the majority of total load recovery occurs within the first three months of production  furthermore, matrix permeability, shut-in time, connate water saturation and fracture compressibility, were found to be the most dominant factors, which can impact the load recovery by up to 22%, 15%, 14%, and 13%, respectively  matrix permeability, production rate constraint, fracture residual oil saturation and shut-in time are four of the prominent parameters affecting oil breakthrough time    understanding the impact of operational parameters such as shut-in time and production rate can help industry to implement recycling/disposal options and ultimately optimize load recovery  this can also create significant environmental compliance benefits for operators in addition to benefitting operational efficiency | 
175947-ms 	 lithological controls on mechanical anisotropy in shales to predict in situ stress magnitudes and potential for shearing of laminations during fracturing |abstract   accurate and repeatable assessments of in situ stress magnitudes and orientation in unconventional reservoirs can be complicated by the heterogeneous, inelastic, and/or anisotropic mechanical properties of these rocks and their complex history of burial and diagenesis  the associated vertical and lateral variation in pore pressure and stress through the target zones and bounding intervals can further complicate this effort  for these reasons, some additional factors need to be considered beyond the typical workflow of determining closure stress from standard mini-frac data and using this data to calibrate log derived stress profiles  we present some case study examples from hydrocarbon-producing shales where a more rigorous analysis of the mechanical properties of the shale has allowed a more accurate and repeatable assessment of in situ stress and potential for lamination shearing  horizontal fracture growth through shear activation of bedding-parallel fabric can be a preferred fracture propagation mechanism in these shales and this behavior can be diagnosed by this improved workflow  in one case study example, in the tight gas montney siltstone of western canada, shear strength anisotropy is shown to be very significant, with bedding parallel shear cohesion less than 10% of the bulk rock cohesion  for such situations it can be shown that shear fracturing of laminations is likely  it has been demonstrated through pressure transient analysis of minifrac injection and flowback data that this can be diagnosed  many fracturing related mechanisms are also stress dependent and their understanding requires assessment of all in situ stress magnitudes, not just minimum horizontal stress  an improved method of analyzing these stress magnitudes and fracturing mechanisms is described through anisotropy measurements in core samples and a micro-mechanical understanding of the rock fabric  in this way, a petrophysical relationship can be established between anisotropy parameters and rock properties |

175964-ms 	 a material balance equation for stress-sensitive shale gas reservoirs considering the contribution of free, adsorbed and dissolved gas |abstract   unconventional shale gas reservoirs around the world have been proven to store gigantic volumes of natural gas  it has been demonstrated with both laboratory and mathematical work that these reservoirs can be represented by a quintuple porosity formulation plus an additional storage mechanism provided by dissolved gas in kerogen  all these storage mechanisms must be considered for estimation of original gas in place (ogip)  otherwise pessimistic values of ogip and recoveries will be obtained by ignoring any of these mechanisms  this paper presents a new easy-to-use material balance equation (mbe) for shale gas reservoirs that considers the contribution of free, adsorbed and dissolved gas and their effects on cumulative gas production  furthermore the proposed mbe takes into account the stress-dependency of permeability and porosity as the reservoir is depleted    aguilera (2008) formulated a mbe to account for the effect of fracture compressibility on ogip determination in stress-sensitive naturally fractured reservoirs  cabrapan et al  (2014) extended the method by incorporating adsorption in shale gas reservoirs  the authors used the langmuir adsorption theory for quantifying the adsorbed gas volume as a function of average reservoir pressure  in this paper, the method is further extended to include the effect of production by diffusion of dissolved gas from kerogen  the volume of dissolved gas depends on the total fractional volume of kerogen in shale and the methane concentration in the kerogen body, which is in turn a function of pressure and temperature, as proposed by swami et al  (2013)    results are presented as crossplots of p/z (pressure/gas deviation factor) vs  gp (cumulative gas production), gp vs  time and gas rate vs  time  the plots allow detecting four stages of production in a shale gas reservoir: 1) production of free gas from fractures and organic porosity, 2) production of free gas from the inorganic matrix when fractures start closing, 3) production by desorption from the organic material and 4) production by diffusion of dissolved gas  the same trends have been observed in devonian shales of the appalachian basin where long production histories are available  it is concluded that dissolved gas is not only an additional storage mechanism but it also provides an important pressure and production contribution in shale reservoirs    the new consideration introduced in the mbe proposed in this paper is of importance because although diffusion from kerogen in shale gas reservoirs is by nature a slow process, it provides long term production rates with relatively small declines  to the best of our knowledge, an analytical mbe that includes simultaneously stress-dependent porosity and permeability, free gas, adsorbed gas and dissolved gas has not been published previously in the literature |

175972-ms 	 coupled fluid-solid geomechanical modeling of multiple hydraulic fractures interacting with natural fractures and the resulting proppant distribution |abstract   the application of a new material point method (mpm) approach to model the proppant distribution in a reservoir where hydraulic fractures interact with natural fractures is presented and validated with an eagle ford well  the new mpm approach uses particles to represent the slurry and its effects on the hydraulic and natural fractures  the particles are injected in the hydraulic fractures and their action causes the hydraulic fractures to propagate and interact with the natural fractures thus providing new pathways for the proppant to move away from the wellbore when optimal natural fracture orientations are encountered  elementary tests, conducted with the new mpm approach show that fractures oriented in certain directions close to the hydraulic fracture orientation facilitate the proppant placement while other fracture orientations that are perpendicular to the hydraulic fracture or close to perpendicular direction appear to cause screen out  when using the new mpm approach on multiple interacting natural fractures with different orientations the same conclusions observed with one single fractures still hold and only those close to the orientation of the hydraulic fractures promote the placement of the proppant  the application of the new technology to an eagle ford well shows that the simulated proppant travels the farthest in the frac stage that is known from other methods and measurements to be the one with the best half fracture length  furthermore, the examination of the simulated proppant concentration curve versus time shows striking similarities with the actual slurry concentration measured at the same well  these encouraging results show that the macroscopic modeling of proppant distribution using the new mpm technology could help improve our understanding of the complex hydraulic fracturing process and the resulting proppant distribution |

175983-ms 	 case studies in quantitative flowback analysis |abstract   recently, several authors have explored new methods for quantitatively analyzing multi-phase flowback data from multi-fractured horizontal wells (mfhw) to extract both fracture and reservoir parameters  these techniques provide much of the same information as long-term rate-transient analysis (rta), although in a much shorter period of time  flowback analysis is complicated by a rapidly changing fracture network and wellbore environment, multi-phase flow in the fractures (and possibly the reservoir), completion heterogeneity, as well as other effects which are often not present, or are ignored, when analyzing long-term (online) production data    for quantitative flowback analysis, the current authors have previously presented data-driven, pseudo-analytical methods for estimating key fracture properties (i e  conductivity and half-length) from high-frequency, short-duration production test data  models have been developed for both oil and gas wells representing a variety of reservoir and operating conditions  in this work, the models and procedures are extended to apply to more challenging reservoir/completion scenarios and are used in the analysis of several case studies from canada  each of the case studies demonstrate either the potential value add of the developed techniques, or a unique extension to the basic analysis methods    the case studies analyzed herein focus on light tight oil plays and consider layered reservoirs, multi-well flowback, and oil fracs in oil reservoirs  further, the potential capital savings associated with conducting quantitative flowback analysis of early-time production test data is demonstrated  each case study therefore presents a unique set of challenges that are often encountered in the real world  numerical simulations are used to validate the sequence of flow-regimes depicted in the models    the methods presented in this paper will serve to partially satisfy the demands of industry to develop new methods for characterizing hydraulic fractures and forecasting production, particularly early in the well life  through the use of several unique case studies, the wide-spread applicability and versatility of the techniques is demonstrated | 
175991-ms 	 modeling the kerogen 3d molecular structure |abstract   during the past decade, there has been a surge in the production of shale oil and this trend is expected to continue in future due to the abundant shale oil reserve  currently, one main issue with shale oil production is the low primary recovery factors still less than 10%  therefore, efficient enhanced oil recovery methods are highly desired to improve shale oil recovery  as an essential component of shale, kerogen plays a key role in generation, adsorption, storage and migration of hydrocarbons in shale as well as the geomechanical properties of shale  on the other hand, during the shale oil extraction process, shale oil can be produced from kerogen by pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution reactions  the basis to improve the efficiency of both recovery and extraction processes is to establish and clarify the molecular structure of kerogen  previously, some 2d molecular structures of kerogen have been proposed based on some characterization techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and mass spectrospcoy  however, the physical and chemical properties of kerogen are essentially determined by its 3d stereochemical molecular configuration    in this work, according to the 2d molecular structure of green river oil shale kerogen from literature, a 3d solid state model of kerogen was built based on molecular dynamics(md) simulation method  the kerogen of green river oil shale is a mixture of seven molecules that are held together by physical adsorption mechanism  this kerogen belongs to type i based on o/c (0 026) and h/c (1 57) ratios  an adsorption method was applied to combine the seven molecules together  by changing the adsorption sequences of the seven molecules, a total of 24 possible 3d nanocluster models of kerogen were obtained  then the 3d nanocluster structure with the lowest energy was further applied to build the solid state model of kerogen at 298k under 1 atm based on a md simulation method  the final 3d solid state model of kerogen was used to calculate the density, mechanical properties, nmr, ir and raman spectra of kerogen  the theoretical results agree well with the experimental data  the density from the 3d structure was calculated as 0 968 g/cm3 which falls in the range of experimental results from 0 95 to 1 45 g/cm3  the calculated young's modulus, poisson ratio, compressibility, bulk modulus and shear modulus are 3 50 gpa, 0 25, 370 64 tpa-1, 2 63 gpa and 1 37 gpa respectively that matches the experimental results very well  the calculated spectral data are also in accord with the experimental results  these results will help us better understand the physical and chemical properties of green river oil shale kerogen  moreover, the calculated properties of kerogen can be applied to implement new techniques or improve existing methods for enhancing oil recovery from shale oil resources | 
175994-ms 	 numerical study of production mechanisms in unconventional liquid-rich shale volatile oil reservoirs |abstract   liquid-rich shale (lrs) volatile oil plays exhibit several challenges to modeling and analyzing such as flattened produced gas oil ratio (gor), complex phase behavior, rock properties and fluid flow influenced by pore proximity effects in nano pores  in this study we investigated multi-phase flow and the governing flow mechanisms in these resources using a new procedure to divide shale matrix into different sub-media and a new methodology to model well performance    we have developed new correlations for modifying pvt properties in nano pores to incorporate the impact of nano-pore confinement on phase behavior  we have subdivided shale matrix into three zones, nano-pores, micro pores, and natural (macro) fractures along with propped fractures with distinctive pvt, rock compaction and relative permeability properties in a compositional simulation model  we have implemented logarithmically-spaced local grid refinement (ls-lgr) to track saturation and pressure changes around the hydraulic fracture  results from our new method were validated against production data from several lrs oil wells in the eagle ford shale    our numerical model reproduced anomalous produced gor's that have been observed in liquid-rich shale oil wells  the study showed that the main impacts of nano-pore confinement on phase behavior, rock properties and fluid flow are reduction of bubble point, enhancement of critical gas saturation and severe permeability reduction due to compaction  delayed development of two-phase flow as a result of reduction of the bubble point pressure in nano-pores causes the "flat" gor's observed in early stages of production  enhancement of critical gas saturation delays mobilization of gas molecules in nano-pores and could extend non-intuitive gor behavior further when reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point  we found that ultimate oil recovery could change more than 20% by permeability reduction due to compaction  the study revealed that the period of constant produced gor depends on the volatility of the reservoir fluid and pore size distribution in the reservoir  for moderate-gor oil reservoirs, the constant gor duration is greater than for highly volatile oil reservoirs, as well as in reservoirs with a greater percentage of nano pores    the methodology introduced in this study allows us to better model lrs volatile oil wells and to estimate eur more accurately  these new correlations for modifying bulk pvt properties under confinement combined with numerical models enables reservoir engineers to understand better the complicated physics in lrs volatile oil reservoir performance | 
175995-ms 	 seismic methodologies adapted for use in acoustic logging |if we are to continue to use acoustic logging as a viable method for characterizing wellbore formation characteristics, such as natural fractures, then logging techniques developed for conventional reservoirs and vertical wells should be updated and adapted for use in today's unconventional and directional drilling applications  unlike seismic processes, which have undergone research and changes to adapt to the more complex characterization needs of today's wells, acoustic logging techniques have stayed relatively stagnant  in order to stay relevant, acoustic logging processes must adapt for use in unconventionals as well  the following discussion focuses on four seismic techniques adapted for acoustic logging processes, the process for choosing these particular techniques to adapt, and the results achieved  |we have based new acoustic logging algorithms and routines on these four seismic techniques and adapted the research into proprietary software for processing raw, acoustic waveform data  first, we have adapted the use of compressional waves to map drops in energy across natural fractures which allows industry to move away from many of the limitations imposed by more widely used techniques  second, as part of the workflow presented in the compressional fracture identification methodology, we have adapted stacking to improve results and amplify anomalies  third, in order to provide a broad available toolsets and usable data, we have incorporated advanced filtering routines based on predictive deconvolution, which can be used to process acoustic data from alternative tools or to enhance data collected using measurement-while-drilling or logging-while-drilling tools  fourth and last, applicable to both shear and compressional waveform processing, we have chosen to move away from alford-based azimuth computations, or at least correct for assumptions in alford-based azimuth computations that are not relevant in unconventionals, so that borehole deviation does not adversely affect the processing  |the use of compressional waves to map natural fracture patterns has found great success in both vertical and lateral wells and has been used in the field in the permian, eagle ford, the bakken, and in various international fields  comparisons against image and core results demonstrate an 80-85% correlation rate  the following discussion will go over two case studies, the evaluation method used to study the correlation, briefly discuss the workflow used, and also provide an example of how the advanced filtering produces much cleaner waveforms for processing than relying solely on frequency filtered waveforms  |these new processes allow acoustic processing to enter the modern age of exploration and create a new, more direct process for finding the fracture density in the well bore  furthermore, they may be incorporated in to new and old processing techniques, making the most of the modern tools available | 
176027-pa 	 pressure-transient characteristics of hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in shale-gas reservoirs with natural- and rejuvenated-fracture networks |summary |during the past few years, several studies have analyzed the pressure-transient responses of hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in shale-gas reservoirs  however, that research included simplified models that reflected natural and hydraulic fractures -only, unlike real shale reservoirs  to develop an accurate shale-gas model, this study considers the effects of rejuvenated fractures as well as natural and hydraulic fractures  rejuvenated fractures, regarded as an important specificity in this paper, are revitalized natural fractures created by hydraulic fracturing  to analyze the pressure-transient characteristics and productivity of fractured horizontal wells in shale reservoirs, extensive numerical simulations have been conducted  this model considers the effects of natural- and rejuvenated-fracture permeability, matrix permeability, parameters of hydraulic fractures (e g , width, height, and half-length), and the range of stimulated reservoir volume  results show a clear distinction between existing models and the proposed model  in the proposed model, the boundary induced by the rejuvenated fractures generates pseudoboundary-dominated flow  this work expands our insight into the pressure-transient characteristics of a hydraulically fractured horizontal well in a shale-gas system | 
176034-pa 	 origin of overpressure in a field in the southwestern malay basin |summary |this study demonstrates the use of wireline logs for the overpressure-mechanisms analysis in a field in the southwestern malay basin  the development of overpressure means that the fluid movement in the pores is retarded, both vertically and laterally  in many tertiary basins, overpressure is mainly generated by compaction disequilibrium caused by a high deposition rate and low permeability in shales  in the malay basin, temperature and high heat flow also play an important role in generating overpressure at a shallow depth, because the geothermal gradient is very high (40–60c/km)  pore-pressure profiles and crossplots of sonic velocity/vertical effective stress and of velocity/density are used to derive the overpressure-generating mechanisms  the results obtained from the crossplots of 10 wells reveal that in the study area, overpressure is generated by both primary (compactiondisequilibrium) and secondary (fluid-expansion) mechanisms  the overpressure-magnitude analysis suggests that the overpressure generated by the secondary mechanism is very high compared with the primary mechanism  in all the wells, the eaton (1972) method with an exponent of 3 gives good prediction when overpressure is the result of the compaction-disequilibrium mechanism, but it underpredicted the high pore pressure where the fluid expansion mechanism is also present  however, by use of a higher eaton exponent of 5 for the fluid-expansion mechanism, the overpressures are predicted quite well  the bowers (1995) method, by use of the unloading parameter (u) of 6, is also used for pressure prediction and it gives a reasonably good prediction in the high overpressure zone of all the wells | 
176071-ms 	 the channel fracturing technique improves tight reservoir potential in the ordos basin, china |abstract   the ordos basin, located in northwest china, has large known hydrocarbon reserves that represent unique reservoir challenges and require specific operational, logistical, and technical expertise  one of the immediate objectives for petrochina changqing is to exploit these low-permeability oil and gas sandstones of the yanchang formation, and this is done through both vertical and horizontal wells types that include single-stage and multistage hydraulic fracturing treatments    historically, individual well productivity has been impacted by complex reservoir dynamics, uncertain subsurface properties, and identifying those areas where critical geological and reservoir factors exist in order to generate substantial production  however, most hydraulic fracturing treatments result in low production rates due to reservoir pressure being below the hydrostatic pressure gradient  therefore, principal fracturing challenges include trying to engineer a highly conductive flow path that depends on fluid viscosity and stability to build geometry and transport proppant toward the fracture tip, while rapidly returning to the base-fluid viscosity to be flowed back    since reduced fracture conductivity and length were detrimental to well performance, a hydraulic fracturing technique that incorporates the creation of channels within the fracture was deployed  this technology optimized reservoir inflow performance through a specified engineering workflow that requires specific equipment and pumping controls with fluid and fiber technologies  these channels created infinite-conductivity paths for fluid to flow from the reservoir to the wellbore, resulting in higher well productivity    the deployment and application of this technology included 65 treatments performed on five vertical and five horizontal wells in oil blocks and two vertical wells in a gas block  production performance for all oil wells treated with the flow-channel fracturing technique had initial production index figures being 2 4 times the field average and those wells continue to be upper performers when compared to 180-day accumulated production figures  for the gas wells, 4 to 5 times initial gas production rate was achieved when compared to the average offset wells  in all well cases, channel fracturing increased operational efficiency while resulting in no screenouts | 
176076-ms 	 a novel hydraulic fracturing technique greatly improves hydrocarbon recovery through the use of temporary beneficial changes in stress anisotropy |abstract   the effects of the earth's tectonic movements are well understood, especially in the formulation of stress anisotropy in a large region  this primarily mechanical effect stays unchanged because the support systems, such as faults, compressions, etc , remain unchanged until the next major tectonic activity  on the other hand, pressure effects are generally semi-permanent and are usually affected by the production history of the formation  in this stress domain, fracture placement during a stimulation treatment will always follow the direction of maximum stress; by definition, this is a fixed direction defined by the known stress anisotropy landscape    this paper presents a different approach for the stimulation process  instead of a conventional, static, or end-point vision of the stimulation, a dynamic, or temporary, time-dependent stimulation method is introduced  the new method creates a small tectonic motion—significantly smaller than that of natural tectonics—and uses it to temporarily modify the local stress anisotropy  the "micro" tectonic motion is created by means of a conventional fracture placed in the natural maximum stress direction  another fracture can then be created using the same approach but in a temporarily modified stress field that forces it in a different fracture direction  this new multioriented hydraulic fracture (mohf) stimulation method can enhance state-of-the-art hydraulic fracturing technology by requiring an understanding of the transient geomechanic response in the treatment area    as a time-dependent method, this approach can create new opportunities in both conventional and unconventional plays by providing connectivity to previously unattainable locations in the formation  unfortunately, it can also result in new complications  industry standard fracture simulation technology becomes incomplete, as most models neglect the transient response of the system  additionally, the availability of data related to the dynamic behavior of rocks is limited  the dynamic compression of the rock, slip characteristics between rock layers, and the amount of energy stored within slip planes—all recorded as a function of time—are particularly important when considering an mohf process  additional testing should be performed to obtain these data  with such data, time-sensitive operational recommendations for performing the mohf stimulation can be provided to help achieve the maximum production increase from the well    this paper also discusses a computational validation of the mohf process  as traditional hydraulic fracture simulations are derived using static formation properties and steady-state assumptions of the formation behavior, a unique transient three-dimensional (3d) computational geomechanic fracture simulator was developed to perform this study  the new model incorporates cohesive zone elements to represent the fracture plane and captures the dynamics of fracture initiation and propagation, as well as the transient stress modification in the formation  a realistic 3d fracture transient behavior is accounted for by the inclusion of multiple rock layers in the model, which are connected through energy absorbing frictional elements  production levels of two to five times greater were predicted using reliable production simulators |

177302-ms 	 experimental investigation of geomechanical impacts on organic-rich shales matrix-fracture characterization |abstract   during hydraulic fracturing process, the formation undergoes significant changes in the net stress as a result of the fluid injection and retrieval  these stress changes impact the formation petrophysical properties including permeability, porosity, and the compressibility  in this experimental study, the impact of geomechanical changes on shales petrophysical properties is investigated using a laboratory set-up that was designed and assembled for fast and robust shale core plug porosity and permeability measurements under steady-state conditions  this laboratory set-up is capable of accurately measuring shale core plug ultra-low permeability and porosity because it has a resolution of one millionth standard cubic centimeters per second for gas flow rate and one hundredth cubic centimeters for pore volume measurement  the laboratory set-up allows measurements to be performed under isothermal conditions by automated temperature control  the application of the confining pressure on the shale core plug allows permeability and porosity to be measured under a wide range of net stress    a sequential set of experiments were performed in this study  during the first set of experiments, the permeability of the core plug was measured by increasing the net stress from 500 psia to 7,900 psia followed by decreasing net stress from 7,900 psia to the initial net stress condition  the next three sets of experiments repeated the same steps as the first set on the same core plug  however, during the third set only the porosity, and during the fourth set only permeability was measured    the measured porosity and permeability values from the experiments clearly exhibited hysteresis with the net stress changes  the hysteresis was more pronounced for permeability than it was for porosity  since the permeability changes were non-linear with respect to net stress changes, walsh method was used to estimate the fracture closure pressure  the results indicate that sequential net stress changes can cause a reduction in fracture closure pressure  this reduction however tends to diminish with increasing number of sequential stress changes  finally, comparing the porosity and permeability measurements revealed two distinctive behavioral changes for both porosity and permeability that can be contributed to the natural fracture and matrix properties | 
177309-ms 	 petrophysical and geomechanical analysis of knox group reservoirs and caprocks across the northern appalachian basin as a function of depth |abstract   growth in unconventional shale development and its associated flow-back water disposal needs have led to significant demands for brine disposal wells in the appalachian basin  the ordovician-cambrian age knox group carbonates and clastics includes several formations utilized for brine disposal in the northern appalachian basin  the depth of the knox group injection intervals changes significantly in the basin, from outcroppings to potentially over 15,000 feet  the significant depth change causes variation in porosity, permeability, and elastic properties in the knox group and caprocks that should be analyzed for estimating injection capacity across the region    to study petrophysical and rock mechanical behavior with increasing depth, we selected eight wells whose depths of injection intervals in the knox group and the overlying caprock formations are progressively deeper to the east  the first step is building scatter plots to understand how petrophysical characteristics, including sonic wave velocity, density-neutron porosity, and gamma ray data, are related to each other  then, multivariate linear regression is used to determine compressional and shear wave velocity as a function of other petrophysical parameters  the t-statistic for each coefficient in the correlation tests the null hypothesis to show significance of coefficients  the dynamic mechanical properties are also determined using dipole sonic and density logs across the region    we investigate the effect of depth on the relationship between petrophysical parameters, and we study the variations in trends that may be caused by geological events  while the large variation of petrophysical parameters in the rose run sandstone shows the important effect of formation cementation and consolidation by depth, the limited variability of petrophysical parameters in the copper ridge dolomite injection interval proves that its characteristics are not dependent on depth  the effect of petrophysical variation shows its direct effect on rock mechanical properties that its distribution is limited in copper ridge dolomite in comparison to rose-run sandstone  in addition, where the knox unconformity is present, there exists a completely different relationship between petrophysical parameters for the injection intervals below it and the main caprocks above it  while the content of gamma ray affects formation characteristics above the unconformity, such a trend was not seen in formations below it    with focus on injection into sub-knox unconformity formations, understanding petrophysical parameter variations in the injection and caprock intervals seems necessary  our results indicate that using statistical plots and regression provides an opportunity to understand the relationship between multiple numbers of petrophysical parameters with significant amounts of data  the derived correlations could also be used to determine mechanical properties for the geomechanical analysis across the region, especially when dipole sonic logs are not available | 
177310-ms 	 using the wrong method to estimate stress from depletion causes significant errors in predicting wellbore integrity and fracture geometry |abstract   when calculating the downhole stresses affecting a wellbore during depletion it has become a standard industry practice to assume only the pore pressure changes, and not the rock mechanical properties  this assumption has the potential to underestimate the total horizontal stress (sh) causing unrealistic fracture containment  it will also overestimate the effective horizontal stress (sh' = sh - biot * pore pressure) for open-hole wellbore failure  high effective horizontal stress assumption can potentially transform rock from brittle to ductile behavior and failure mechanics from shear to compaction and the model becomes overly conservative  ductile and compaction failure can cause changes in well integrity, as well as changes in fracture geometry from offset infill wells  this paper will document changes in rock properties in the bakken formation during variable depletion (10% to 65%) and recalculate rock properties (velocities, mechanical properties - young's modulus, poisson's ratio, and biot's anisotropic compressibility constant) as a function of effective stress due to production in order to accurately calculate fracture geometry at an offset well and parent well bore integrity  hydraulic fracturing simulations are performed to simulate well communication between the fractured well and the depleted parent well along with the potential to re-fracture the parent well using the pore pressure, linear, and non-linear models  laboratory testing performed on rock samples is shown to validate the non-linear model | 
177319-ms 	 modeling multi-stage twisted hydraulic fracture propagation in shale reservoirs considering geomechanical factors |abstract   to model hydraulic fracture propagation in naturally fractured reservoirs, fracture propagation is generally assumed to be a single planar fracture propagated only in the vertical direction from a horizontal well, regardless of the presence of natural fractures  in this paper, we developed a multi-stage hydraulic fracture propagation model using a twisted multiple planar fracture that is able to describe the propagation of hydraulic fractures more realistically  in propagating hydraulic fractures, we used two criteria: maximum tangential stress, to determine the fracture initiation angle, and whether a hydraulic fracture passes through a natural fracture  the developed model was used with a commercial reservoir simulator through grid mapping in the form of a discrete fracture network using microseismic data  the results of the verification matched the experimental results well for various intersection angles and maximum horizontal stress directions  in the investigation of the direction of maximum horizontal stress, the frictional coefficient of the fracture interface, and fracture orientation, hydraulic fracture propagation modeling results showed that the hydraulic fracture passed through a natural fracture, and thereafter propagated in a manner suitably consistent with the theoretical results, based on a fracture interaction criterion  after confirming the twisted multiple planar fracture model suggested in this work, discrepancies were found in the fracture connectivity and the stimulated reservoir volume  this indicates that the twisted multiple planar fracture approach, which is more realistic in terms of fracture propagation, is extremely important in evaluating the initial gas in place, calculated according to the stimulated reservoir volume |

177412-ms 	 enhanced core analysis workflow for the geomechanical characterization of reservoirs in a giant offshore field, abu dhabi |abstract   this paper is focused on the integration of two laboratory centimeter-resolution logs of mechanical properties (strength and compressional elastic-wave velocity vp) into an enhanced core analysis workflow for the geomechanical characterization of unconventional reservoirs in a giant field in abu dhabi, where fracking is the cornerstone for producing the unconventional oil  the design and placement of hydraulic fratures rely strongly on the a-priori knowledge of the stress profile and brittleness index, which were estimated via a mechanical earth model constructed from wireline logs and correlations based on us shales analogues  with most of the stratigraphic column in the abu dhabi field composed of carbonates, the calibration of the mechanical earth models was found critical as the us shales based correlations would otherwise not have been suitable to the geomechanical characterization of these tight carbonate reservoirs    with this case study we illustrate:   how the combination of the continuous profiles of rock strength ucs (uniaxial compressive strength) and p-wave velocity measured directly on dry cores with the scratch tests contributes to the identification of different geomechanical facies,   how the mapping of several geomechanical facies enables the building of a simple yet robust relationship between the ucs measured directly on cores and properties such as the total porosity and acoustic velocities of sonic waves, obtained from wireline logs, and   how the centimeter-resolution profiles of strength and elastic wave velocities measured on dry cores enable the proper upscaling of geomechanical properties measured on plug samples to the entire cored section and the computation of a horizontal stress and brittleness profiles derived from unbiased geomechanical properties  |from this case study follows a general discussion on the relevance of wireline sonic logs relative to centimetric resolution data (scratch profiles or plug measurement) acquired on dry cores for the geomechanical characterization of reservoirs  we conclude that measurements on dry cores enable the more robust calibration of mechanical earth model and in turn better description of the reservoir mechanical response  the upscaled profiles of horizontal stress and brittleness index derived from dry core measurements would ultimately lead to an alternative strategy for the design and placement of hydraulic fractures along producing wells | 
177457-ms 	 geomechanical mechanism of hydraulic fracturing and fracability evaluation of natural fractured tight sandstone reservoir in keshen gasfield in tarim basin |abstract   keshen gas field, located in kuqa depression of tarim basin, northwest china, is an ultra-deep (7000m), high pressure and high temperature fractured tight sandstone gas reservoir with low permeability of 0 09md and strong stress anisotropy about 30 mpa in horizontal stress contrast  for economic development, hydraulic fracturing is necessary in this reservoir    to understand the mechanism of hydraulic fracturing and evaluate the fracability and fracture this reservoir efficiently, an integrated research has been conducted  we established a geomechanical model which described vertical and horizontal distribution of the geomechanical parameters in this reservoir  a fracturing experimental simulation was conducted with large size rock samples to analyze the interactive relationship between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures during fracturing  we also carried out a sensitive study to comfirm the key parameters for optimizing fracturing treatment design  finally a new fracablity index calculation method suitable for fractured tight sandstone was built    it is shown that for fractured tight sandstone reservoir with strong stress anisotropy like keshen, shear deformation of natural fractures is a key factor of creating fracture area with high permeability  and the evolution of fracture area during fracturing experienced three processes  (1)fracturing fluid extends along natural fracture at the initial fracturing stage; (2)at a certain injection pressure, slight shear deformation happens along the plane of natural fracture  as injection pressure increases, fracturing fluid breaks through a weak point of natural fracture and propagates along the direction of maximum horizontal stress; (3)a new set of fractures with combination of tensile-opening and shearing are formed, which are caused by changing of in-situ stress field around natural fractures  these three processes happen alternately and eventually form an ideal fracture area  it is also found that post-fracturing productivity has a close correlation with the shear deformation of natural fractures  at the axis of structure or fault developed area, natural fractures with strong potential shear deformation trend are more easily stimulated, and productivity can be high after fracturing  by contrast, fractures at structure saddle or steep part have weak potential shear deformation trend and are difficult to be stimulated, and thus productivity would likely be lower  accoding to the mechanism of fracturing, we considered that the fracability of fractured tight sandstone is a function, and the parameters are in situ stress, shearing slip deformation, brittleness and fracture toughness    mechanisms of hydraulic fracturing and key factors effecting well productivity after fracturing in keshen reservoir have been found through this study  hydraulic fracturing treatment design and execution were conducted based on this study  after fracturing, the production performance (open flow potential) of stimulated wells increased by four-fold on average |

177631-ms 	 mapping geomechanical state of unconventional shale - a more robust, faster lab characterization method |abstract   unconventional shale mechanical parameters are important for many applications such as reservoir stress-state determination, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing design among other engineering design parameters  these parameters include young's modulus, poisson's ratio, cohesion, angle of internal friction, and unconfined compressive strength  their determination is commonly performed on single-stage triaxial (sst) compression tests using three or more core samples at various confining pressures  for unconventional shale, this has been a practical bottleneck - it is very difficult to drill multiple plugs with good quality from a whole core because of its brittleness and complexity  an alternative procedure is the multi-stage triaxial (mst) compression test, which requires only one plug to be tested  however, its main problem lies in the practical difficulty in determining the failure envelope of the sample  judgment must be made regarding the stress-strain state "immediately prior to failure"  it is not uncommon that a wrong estimation of the failure state occurs when interpreting these stress-strain curves  the mst test uses one plug, which in itself could be a significant advantage    this paper presents a robust modified method of the mst compression test that accurately determines the imminent rock failure through continuously monitoring the radial deformation  to test and validate the method, berea sandstone and mancos shale plugs are selected to perform a series of the sst and mst tests  for each rock type, at least four plugs are used, which are cut from the same whole core or have similar lithofacies  experimental results show that the mohr-coulomb failure envelope can be generated perfectly from both the sst and mst tests  however, the failure parameters derived from the mst tests are lower than those from the sst tests  the difference may be attributed to the intrinsic heterogeneity of rock samples or the damage accumulated from the early stages in a mst test  the proposed mst method is an efficient alternative to generate the mohr-coulomb failure envelope when the availability of core samples with good quality is limited, especially in the exploration and development of unconventional reservoirs |

177994-ms 	 magnetic flux leakage (mfl) technology provides the industry’s most precise pipe integrity and corrosion evaluation, accurately characterizing casing and tubing strength - technology overview and case… |abstract  |the magnetic flux leakage (mfl) technique is the most commonly used technique to inspect large diameter transmission pipelines  a typical mfl inspection system uses permanent magnets to apply an axially oriented magnetic field to the ferromagnetic pipe material  the magnetic field is perturbed by a metal-loss region (usually caused by corrosion) to produce flux leakage outside the pipe, which can be measured by field sensors  |the magnetization system in an mfl inspection system should ideally produce a magnetic field that is strong enough to cause a measurable amount of magnetic flux to leak from the pipe material at metal-loss regions, uniform from inside to the outside surface of the wall thickness so that the measured signal is more linearly related to metal-loss depth, and consistent in magnitude along the length of a pipe so that flux leakage measurements can be compared at different locations during an inspection run  |in general, the field strength most strongly affects detection of metal loss defects while characterization of defect geometry requires a field that is strong, uniform, and consistent  |improvements in the downhole hardware also provide more flexible and efficient data acquisition, reducing operating time while improving data accuracy and operational safety  in conventional magnetic flux leakage (mfl) tools, the flux leakage sensors are coils; in the “high-resolution” tool, the coil is replaced by multiple “hall effect” sensors  the hr vertilog service uses mfl measurements to identify and quantify internal and external corrosion defects  the overlapping arrays of flux-leakage sensors and discriminator sensors offer full circumferential inspection of the tubing or casing string  this process differentiates between metal-loss (corrosion) and metal-gain (hardware) features, and distinguishes between general corrosion and isolated pitting  paper represents technology overview and field cases history |

178027-ms 	 model of hydraulic fracture initiation from the notched open hole |abstract |in stimulating tight carbonate formations, the propagation of multiple transverse fractures is highly desirable to contact as much matrix as possible  the application of this method to openhole well environments is challenged by the dominating impact of hoop stresses in the near-wellbore vicinity rather than far-field stress in the producing layer  as a result, even if the open hole is drilled in the direction of minimal horizontal far-field stress, there is a high probability that hydraulic fractures initiate longitudinally and then turn to the preferred fracture plane, creating undesired tortuosity  |one of the approaches towards controlling both the position and direction of fracture initiation is to cut notches in the wellbore wall at specified positions  as pressure increases during fracturing, those notches can locally eliminate the influence of the wellbore hoop stress and develop high tensile stress concentrations initiating transverse hydraulic fractures at lower pressures  |a theoretical model is proposed herein that aims to predict the position, orientation, and pressure at which a fracture initiates  in the model, the 3d stress state around wellbore and notch(es) is analyzed using the brittle fracture criteria  in the numerical implementation, the stresses are efficiently resolved using the boundary element method  the model is used to interpret published laboratory data on fracture initiation including those from hydraulic fracturing block tests  it is shown that the conventional maximum tensile stress (mts) criterion fails to reproduce the observed trends in initiation pressure and fracture orientation  the nonlocal modification of the mts criterion based on the stress averaging technique (samts), reveals a good match with initiation pressures in simplified tests  when applied to hydraulic fracturing block test data, samts captures the observed fracture orientations while overestimating the absolute pressure values  the discussion of possible reasons for that overestimate and the way forward concludes the paper  |introduction in low-permeability formations, operators often perform multistage hydraulic fracturing stimulation treatments on intervals along horizontal wells to produce commercial volumes of hydrocarbons  this practice creates several hydraulic fractures oriented transversely to the wellbore, thus providing larger reservoir contact compared to a single longitudinal fracture  the number of fracturing stages run in a single well has been increasing over the last few years, which requires the refinement of the multistage fracturing techniques as well as completion methods from the point of cost, risk, and completion quality  in the case of tight and competent rock, the openhole completion of a horizontal well becomes a cost-effective alternative to a cemented completion  the widely used system to stimulate openhole intervals consists of the use of tubular and hydraulic or swellable packers to isolate fracturing stages (aviles et al  2013; daneshy 2013)  sliding sleeve valves control the fracturing ports between packers and are activated subsequently over a single fracturing treatment from to toe to heel using a drop ball mechanism  upon completion of stimulation of all stages, the balls are flowed back to the surface making the tubular a permanent completion  compared to plug-and-perf techniques in cemented and cased wells, the drop ball technique in horizontal open holes becomes a cost- and time-effective alternative that is now run routinely around the world, in particular in saudi arabia (al-naimi et al  2008; rahim et al  2011)  however, these openhole systems also have potential drawbacks  unlike cased wells that are stimulated through perforations, in openhole stimulation, the length of treated section is defined by the spacing between packers and can vary from 100 ft to 1,000 ft (al-naimi et al  2008)  this leads to fracture(s) initiating at location(s) along the wellbore subjected to the lowest in-situ stresses and/or surrounded by weaker rock or crossed by a natural fracture—factors that are out of the operator’s control  also, even if the wellbore is drilled in the direction of the minimal horizontal far-field stress   <u+03c3>h—the configuration that is favorable for the transverse fracture(s) creation— there is still a significant possibility that the fracture will initiate longitudinally  this basically comes from the fact that the pressurized cylindrical openhole wellbore develops tensile stresses in the circumferential direction rather than in the axial direction that is required for the initiation of transverse fracture (daneshy 2009; lecampion et al  2013)  the fracture initiated longitudinally may break beyond the packer and disturb the isolation between stages  even though the fracture will finally reorient into the transverse direction according to the far-field stresses direction (weijers et al  1994; daneshy 2013), it may create a tortuous fracture path in the vicinity of the wellbore, leading to higher fracturing treatment pressure, premature proppant settling, and near wellbore screen out, thus lowering the eventual completion quality |

178747-stu 	 a comprehensive model for simulation of gas transport in shale formation with complex hydraulic fracture geometry |abstract   a comprehensive model for simulating gas transport in shale formation with complex fracture geometry is still lacking in the petroleum industry  first, the current models are challenging to efficiently handle the complex non-planar fractures with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length due to very complicated gridding issues, an expensive computational cost, and complexities in development of computational codes  second, conventional gas mass balance equation needs to be revised to include all important gas transport mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption  hence, the goal of this study was to develop a new model to fill this gap    we present an efficient semi-analytical model by dividing fractures into several fracture segments to represent the complex non-planar fracture geometry and present a revised mass balance equation to consider all the important gas transport mechanisms for shale gas reservoirs  we verified this model against a numerical reservoir simulator for planar fracture by considering the effects of gas desorption, non-darcy flow, and geomechanics separately  transient flow behavior between planar fractures and non-planar fractures with and without considering the natural fractures was compared  furthermore, a well with actual production data from marcellus shale was analyzed  first, we use a three-dimensional fracture propagation model to generate more-realistic non-planar fracture geometry  then, we apply the fracture geometry into a semi-analytical model to evaluate well performance  contributions of each mechanism to gas recovery are then examined  based on history matching and production forecasting, the difference of cumulative gas production between the realistic non-planar fractures and ideal planar fractures is about 20% at 30 years of production  in addition, the contribution of flow mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption to gas recovery at 30 years of production compared to that without considering them is about 13%, 17%, and 22%, respectively  totally, the contribution of all the important mechanisms is about 52%  hence, modeling of gas production from the realistic non-planar fractures as well as modeling the important gas transport mechanisms in shale gas reservoirs is significant    this work, for the first time, combines a complex non-planar fracture geometry with varying fracture permeability and the important gas transport mechanisms to efficiently analyze field production data from marcellus shale  the model can provide significant insights into understanding the impacts of gas slippage, gas diffusion, gas desorption, and non-planar fracture geometry on long-term gas recovery prediction |

18333-ms 	 mitigating drilling dysfunction using a drilling advisory system: results from recent field applications |abstract   the exxonmobil drilling advisory system (das™) is a rig-based drilling surveillance and optimization platform that encourages regular (guided) drill-off tests, carefully monitors drilling performance and provides recommendations for controllable drilling parameters to help improve the overall drilling process  it is well known that drilling with dysfunction(s), such as bha whirl or bit stick-slip, among others, can damage drilling tools, lead to poor borehole quality and result in significant reductions in rate of penetration (rop)  the ultimate objective of das is to help drillers achieve consistently better and longer bit runs by identifying and mitigating drilling dysfunctions    in this paper we describe the das workflow, provide an overview of many of the key technical components of das and summarize results from several recent field applications  the das workflow includes a learning (or calibration) mode that encourages the driller to explore different operating parameters by conducting drill-off tests, which in turn allows the system to build an understanding of performance trends  this understanding is then exploited by an application mode which leverages results obtained during the learning (or calibration) phase  the workflow is iteratively applied in real-time as drilling operations and geological conditions change    key technical components of the das application include: high quality adaptive filtering algorithms for computing various drilling system performance measures (e g , mse, rop, and stick-slip severity, among others), data encapsulation/dimensionality reduction techniques (i e , the notion of "response points") and reduced order modeling techniques (simplices, smooth response surfaces, etc ) which are ultimately used to generate recommendations for improved performance    using examples from recent offshore field applications, we illustrate the use of adaptive filtering and data encapsulation to process noisy real-time data and extract meaningful trends to enable drilling performance optimization  we show how fitting response surfaces to response points can help elucidate, in real-time, the occurrence of classical drilling dysfunctions such as lateral vibrations (as manifest in increased mse) and stick-slip torsional vibrations  using results from recent applications of das to unconventional pad-drilling operations, we show the impacts of focused drilling performance limiter redesign and real-time das parameter changes on improved overall rop in subsequent wells on a pad | 
18339-ms 	 depositional space: construction and applications to facies and petrophysical property simulations |abstract   in the absence of strong diagenetic or compaction trends, the anisotropy and distribution of facies and petrophysical properties are essentially the result of the composition of the paleoenvironment at the time of deposition and of geological phenomena such as erosion, faulting, and folding, which subsequently altered the geometry of the rocks  understanding and isolating these two parameters (depositional and post-depositional effects) is key to the accurate interpolation and extrapolation of subsurface properties  this requires establishing a mathematical transform between the present-day geometry of rocks and their geometry at the time of deposition  the most common solution consists in relying on the layering and indexing of 3d grids to approximate paleodepositional coordinates  however, it is shown that for both pillar and stair-step grids in presence of tight folds or low-dipping or reverse faults, the variogram ranges, orientations, and facies proportions are significantly distorted when geostatistics are based on cell indexing    four essential properties that a rigorous depositional space should honor are then described and the shortcomings of the existing solutions are analyzed  a novel approach in which the representation of a depositional space is independent of a 3d reservoir grid is then introduced, and it is shown that solid mechanics provide a robust and practical way of building such a computational space  the use of depositional coordinates for performing variogram analysis and property interpolation is also exposed  the proposed approach yields facies distributions that accurately honor the model parameters independently from the structural configuration, while accounting for complex stratigraphic and depositional patterns (erosions, onlaps, etc ) and integrating nondepositional trends and overprints  we demonstrate that, in a variety of geological settings, better results are obtained when property interpolation and simulation do not rely on grid geometry and indexing |

18497-ms 	 evaluation and application of novel technologies and their impact on sustained gas production in saudi arabian reservoirs: field examples |abstract   stimulation treatments in saudi arabian gas reservoirs were initiated in 1998  since then, stimulation gradually became the preferred technology to improve gas production and sustainability  different technologies have been applied over the years, and only the best of them survived the test of time  advances in completion technologies enabled drilling horizontal wells and completing them with multistage stimulation completions in either openhole (oh) or cased hole wellbores  the new generation of stimulation software allowed comprehensive modeling of hydraulic fracturing in a 3d reservoir simulation software platform  advances in logging technologies allowed better estimation of rock mechanical properties, a major input for the fracturing design software  channel fracturing technology mitigated the risk of screenout in proppant fracturing and enabled placing fractures with nearly infinite conductivity that helped in faster cleanup of the well and improved production  the new dualcrosslinked fracturing fluid provided a reliable solution for high-pressure/ high-temperature (hpht) reservoirs that can sustain very high shear degradation  viscoelastic surfactant (ves) based fracturing fluid limited fracture height growth, thereby allowing hydraulic fracturing in pay zones with nearby water zones  emulsified acid allowed live acid to penetrate deeper into the reservoir  fiber laden viscoelastic self-diverting acid proved to be an efficient diverting technique for matrix acidizing and acid fracturing  this paper provides an overview of the different technologies that make stimulation treatments highly successful | 
18523-ms 	 study of electrostatic oil/water separation by ultrasound monitoring: comparison with gravity separation process |the increasing number of off-shore projects has resulted in an important r&d effort to optimize the vessel sizes used for electrostatic dehydrators and desalters, otherwise known as electrocoalescers (ecs)  despite the maturity of this technology, the separator design remains mostly empirical  a very important part of the ecs has an inlet distribution device in the bottom of the vessel: similar to the gravity vertical separators or "wash tanks" separators configuration  in this last process, it has been found that the water drop accumulation at the oil water interface in a compact layer, so-called dense packed zone (dpz), plays a crucial role in the separation efficiency because it acts as a coalescence promoter  the objective of this work is to investigate the oil/water separation under an electrostatic or gravity field, in order to establish the presence and role of the dpz in the separation mechanisms  |an open continuous loop pilot (duss), equipped with an ultrasound scanner and an electric tension generator, was used in this study  duss mimics the wash tank or ecs processes  two crude oils with contrasted separation behaviors were studied  |results show that in order to achieve an optimal separation, it is important to control the inlet flow rates to form a stable dpz with an optimal thickness, either by gravity or electrostatic separation  in the electrostatic case, the electric field placed into the oil zone improves the coalescence of smaller drops that are not able to settle under the gravity field  then, some of these bigger droplets feed the dpz, increasing its thickness and the overall separation efficiency  |nevertheless, the dpz should not reach the electric field in order to avoid shortcuts  over this configuration, it is possible to successfully apply a modeling approach used for vertical gravity separation, known as the dispersion band model  |the robust experimental data obtained provides an interesting base for the understanding of one of the most classical electrostatic separation processes, useful information for the process optimization | 
18537-ms 	 structural uncertainty and inverse characterization of discrete fracture networks with dynamic data |abstract   the realism of modeling well stimulation by hydraulic fracturing, in 3d reservoir grids, heavily depends on the match between the predicted multiple-scale discrete-fracture-network (dfn) and its flow properties, versus the monitored fractures at drilled rocks  unfortunately, monitoring the hydraulic fracturing phenomena and connectivity of dfns at multiple scales is highly uncertain  although fracture orientation and location are measurable at wellbores, and microseismic has contributed to characterize hydraulic fracture geometry; the subseismic connectivity of hydraulic and natural fractures with sweet-spot rock-bodies at larger distances demands advanced integration of preexisting structural features into numerical models  therefore, modern fracture optimization demands the use of 3d stochastic reservoir models  additionally, mismatches between the reality and the model are incidentally observed by comparing bottomhole pressure and multiphase flowrate response in flow models versus downhole monitored data  attempting to recreate the fracturing process requires coupling hydraulic injection, fracturing geomechanics, proppant transport, and flow under preexisting structural uncertainty; at multiple scales  although tools for modeling such a complex workflow exist, results do not automatically match microseismic or other advanced observations, due to preexisting structural uncertainty in the model, and/or limitations of the tools themselves    in this paper, the importance of multiple-scale structural-heterogeneity is emphasized, and the use of "practical" inverse problem solutions of dfn models is suggested for its characterization  the proposed inverse approach is to modify structural object positions, attitudes, and geometries, instead of upscaled flow properties  an industrial scale example of such approach, where the size of pseudo-compartments is controlled by subseismic sealing faults, is recalled  errors in pressure response are correlated to fracture displacements along normal vectors  the use of streamline simulation to facilitate tomography of dfn intensity is evoked  the multistage fracking process is also proposed to be handled with the same approach, modifying the geomechanical fracture model to match monitored flow and proppant transport response  finally, novelties for monitoring proppant transport during fracturing are also highlighted | 
18563-ms 	 recent advances in fiber optic technology for in-well production and injection profiling |abstract   in the past decade, fiber-optic (fo) based sensing has opened up opportunities for in-well reservoir surveillance in the oil and gas industry  distributed temperature sensing (dts) has been used in applications such as steam front monitoring in thermal development projects and injection conformance monitoring in waterflood development projects using warmback analysis and fo-based pressure gauges are deployed commonly  in recent years significant progress has also been made to mature other, new fo-based surveillance methods such as the application of distributed strain sensing (dss) for monitoring reservoir compaction and well deformation, multidrop distributed pressure sensing (dps) for fluid level determination, and distributed acoustic sensing (das) for geophysical and production/injection profiling  for the latter application, numerous field surveys were conducted to develop evaluation algorithms to convert the das noise recordings into flow rates from individual zones    in this paper we present an overview of recent advances in fo-based methods such as das, dts, and dss for the application of production and injection surveillance  from field examples acquired by shell and its affiliates it is clear that fo-based flow monitoring provides a powerful addition to the standard surveillance toolkit and in some cases is even the preferred way of surveillance because of its unique advantages | 
2015-005 	 three dimension geomechanical modeling for drilling in carbonate reservoirs |abstract  carbonate reservoirs hold more than 70% of the worldwide reserves  the knowledge related to the development of those reservoirs is not very developed due to the complexity of the lithology, the presence of post-sedimentation events such as diagenesis and the complex mechanical behavior  with the development of horizontal drilling in order to maximize the reservoir contacts (mrc), the need for accurate characterization of the horizontal variability of the mechanical properties of the rocks, becomes more critical  classical 1d geomechanical models are no longer sufficient for the optimization of the drilling   in this paper we address the issues mentioned above, through a 3d stochastic modeling of one of the critical parameters during the drilling of horizontal wells: the formation parting pressure (fpp)  this parameter allows the optimization of the mud-weight during the drilling of a well and optimizes the economic profitability of this well, while reducing the risks related to under or overpressure   1  introduction  three dimensional modeling of geomechanical parameters of the reservoir is an important task when dealing with drilling wells in carbonate reservoirs (ait- ettajer, et al  2014)(azim, et al  2014)  an inadequate calibration of drilling parameters such as mud weight, injection pressure might increase the cost of the drilling with a possibility of irremediable damaging of the reservoir  classical approaches tend to build a one dimension geomechanical model along the well; however the current development of horizontal wells for optimal well sweeping requires a precise geomechanical model in three dimensions, especially for injection procedure in carbonates reservoirs with heterogeneous rock strengths distribution  we propose a workflow for assessing the critical parameters that impact the drillability and the economic cost of developing carbonate reservoir through horizontal drilling    after a short description of the representation of the 3d reservoir model, we will describe the process of building the 3d model of poisson ratio using laboratory measurements and seismic volumes, and then we will describe the process for 3d assessment of the fracture parting pressure parameter that will help optimizing the drilling parameters  we will show a case study of the application of the workflow for the optimization of the drilling in onshore carbonate reservoir  | 
2015-007 	 stress evolution of rock bolt elements in intersecting joints in rock masses |abstract  computer modeling can be used to explore and gain new insights into the impacts of rock bolt intersecting joints in rock masses, and to estimate the effectiveness of the rock reinforcement system  in order to achieve this goal, numerical simulation was performed using flac3d to investigate the stress evolution in the rock bolts  the coupling algorithm is based on the analytically-derived interface behavior between a rock bolt and the rock material for grouted rock bolts  the shear force generated by slippage along the interface is assumed to have a linear relationship with respect to the relative slipping distance between the rock bolt and the rock  the linear elastic criterion is applied to determine the material behavior of rock bolts before the axial stress reaches the yield value  the pullout tests are simulated to verify the coupling algorithm and the effects of the proposed rock bolt elements  the simulation results show that the proposed rock bolt models can predict the shear forces and axial loading along the rock bolts  for the rock bolts observed in this study, the max axial force was within the design limit of the bolts, thus the support design was shown to be acceptable   1  introduction  rock bolts are used as primary reinforcement to strengthen the jointed/fractured rock mass in civil and mining engineering excavations  windsor (1997) [1] categorized the current reinforcement devices into three fundamental classes: continuous mechanically coupled (cmc), continuous frictionally coupled (cfc) and discretely mechanically or frictionally coupled (dmfc)  the fully encapsulated rock bolt system belongs to cmc, while expansion shell bolts belong to the dmfc system and the swellex and split set rock bolts to the cfc system  because of the simple installation procedure, effective rock reinforcement and economic factors, cement or resin grouted rock bolts are the most commonly used ground reinforcement method  a series of analytical solutions [2, 3, 4] have been made to study the load transfer mechanism in the rock bolting system  farmer (1975) [5] presented an analytical model to predict the shear stress distribution of fully grouted rock bolts before decoupling occurs in the bolt grout interface  li and stillborg (1999) [6] proposed a model for describing the behavior of rock bolts by dividing the rock bolt into elastic, softening and de-bonding zones  ren et al  (2010) and blanco martin et al  (2011) [2, 3] presented analytical models for fully grouted rock bolts based on a tri-linear bond-slip model  ma et al  (2013) [4] introduced a non-linear bond-slip model to analytically simulate the behavior of fully grouted rock bolts  however, these analytical models have difficulty in representing the true interaction between rock bolts and the in situ rock mass as the solutions are based on simplified bolt-collar loading experiments  in this paper, a rock bolt element with both tension and shear restrictions is developed and implemented into the three dimensional fdm program  a series of pullout tests considering the end effect and bond-stiffness effect of the rock bolt are simulated by using the proposed rock bolt element  thereafter, the effects of shear debonding are simulated by assuming two kinds of constitutive laws for the interface behavior  the debonding process at the nodes and the deformability of a rock bolt are also discussed in this paper | 
2015-008 	 horizontal stress modeling of successively built-up formations: the effect of viscous relaxation and depth-dependent hardening |abstract  when estimating the magnitude of horizontal stresses, elastic properties are often assumed constant over geologic time  in addition, the successive build-up of a formation and its burial history are often not considered despite playing an important role  in this paper, 2d finite element analysis is used to model the successive build-up of a formation with visco-elastic material that hardens with depth  zero lateral strain and extensional lateral strain boundary conditions are explored  in all cases horizontal stresses are lower than vertical stress  effective stress ratios are elevated in visco-elastic cases compared to elastic reference cases   the ability of a visco-elastic material to dissipate deviatoric stresses may cause variations in effective stress ratios imposed by layers with different poisson’s ratios to be much less pronounced than in corresponding linear elastic models  extensional lateral strain boundary conditions lead to further reduced vertical to horizontal effective stress ratios because of reduced lateral confinement  these two mechanisms, viscous relaxation, which equalizes stress, and extensional lateral strain, which decreases horizontal stress, may operate simultaneously to determine the resulting magnitude of horizontal stress and of effective stress ratio  depending on the stress regime, they may work in concert with or in opposition to each other  in the cases considered here, variations in horizontal stress magnitudes are smaller than predicted by linear elastic models, and thus hydraulic fractures may be less confined within low-stress intervals than customarily predicted   1  introduction  estimates of horizontal stress magnitudes are often based on elastic properties under the assumption that present-day geometry and material properties are constant over time  in many cases, estimates of horizontal stress magnitudes do not completely agree with simple predictive theory  for a formation in a normal faulting environment in the gulf of mexico, in-situ effective stress data does not correlate with previously published fracture gradient models [1]  instead, the effective stress ratio appears to be bound on the lower end by k=0 33, which corresponds to a coulomb failure coefficient of µ=0 60, and on the higher end by k=1, which represents the isotropic stress limit  the differences likely result from a combination of effects such as a complicated burial history (e g , [2]), time-dependent tectonic forces, pore pressure variations due to fluid migration, visco-plastic deformation (e g , [3]), diagenesis and viscous relaxation (e g , [4])   as material is deposited in a sedimentary basin and subsequently buried, material parameters change with time or, equivalently, depth  in a simple deposition and burial scenario the most recent deposits, e g  unconsolidated sands in an oceanic basin, can effectively dissipate differential stresses by viscous creep  as material subsides to greater depth and becomes increasingly compacted, it effectively hardens and loses the ability to deform viscously  this paper presents tests of how viscous relaxation and depth-dependent hardening during the formation of a sedimentary basin can influence resulting horizontal stress magnitudes | 
2015-009 	 use of digital imaging processing techniques to characterise block caving secondary fragmentation and implications for a proposed cave-to-mill approach |abstract  this paper focuses on introducing the use of digital imaging processing techniques to obtain the overall size distribution of rock blocks at drawpoints  a photogrammetric analysis code (wipfrag) and an automatic photograph & analysis tool (portametrics) are used to characterise secondary size distribution  preliminary tests on performance of wipfrag and portametrics in capturing particle size distribution were carried out in this paper   to the authors’ knowledge, no significant research has been carried out to date relating caved ore size and hardness on mill performance, also referred to as a mine-to-mill approach  it is anticipated that the results of this work will feed into a larger initiative at the university of british columbia pursuing research on cave-to-mill, a proposed new approach to integrate cave mining with milling processes to improve production and forecasting capabilities  the variable and relatively uncontrollable nature of cave fragmentation is considered to be a key distinguishing feature of the suggested cave-to-mill approach when compared with typical mine-to-mill strategies for open-pit mines   1  introduction  block caving is one of the most cost effective underground mining techniques, typically employed to mine massive low grade deposits  a general block caving mine layout is shown in figure 1, the ore material being mined sequentially in large blocks, with base areas of thousands of square meters  caving is initiated by blasting an underground tunnel (called undercut) under the block of ore that is to be excavated  as caving of the ore is initiated, the undercut is connected with the production level by blasting bell-shaped ore passages (drawpoints)  the broken ore material falls into the production level through the drawpoints, then transported to the crushers and, subsequently, brought to the surface  as broken ore is removed from the drawpoints, the ore above continues to break and cave in by gravity   ore fragmentation in a block caving process includes three stages: i) in-situ fragmentation; ii) primary fragmentation and iii) secondary fragmentation  in-situ fragmentation is the original condition of rock fragmentation before the undercut is blasted  loading conditions imposed on the rock mass by the caving process leads to primary fragmentation, as a combination of failure along existing discontinuities and fracturing of the intact rock  secondary fragmentation is the reduction in size of primary fragmentation blocks as they move down through the ore column to the drawpoints   secondary fragmentation has long been recognized as a key parameter for evaluating block caving productivity and assessing the possibility of hang-ups, which is caused by large boulders becoming stuck within inside the drawpoints  whereas fragmentation controls the overall success and profitability of a block caving operation, it is extremely difficult to measure in a reliable and routinely manner  for example, in-situ fragmentation can be estimated based on the characterization of the natural fracture network and the use of discrete fracture network (dfn) techniques [1], while secondary fragmentation can be potentially | 
2015-010 	 a joint asperity degradation model based on the wear process |abstract  joints can significantly affect the mechanical behaviour of rock masses  the presence of a joint set is crucial to the initiation and propagation of caving  a numerical approach to cave assessment requires a realistic joint constitutive model, and therefore produces better prediction of the cavability of the orebody  an asperity degradation model for rock joints has been developed that considers the progressive abrasion of a true roughness area over joint sliding  the magnitude of dilatancy is predicted to be decreased exponentially with the increase in shear displacements  the degradation in dilation and post-peak strength along asperities is modelled on the basis of the wear process  then, geometric conditions and rock strength are considered through the dimensional analysis  experimental studies of direct shear tests have been conducted using triangular shaped asperities and the results are correlated with the model’s behaviour to demonstrate its performance  the proposed joint model can be readily implemented in numerical procedures such as discrete element method and used to simulate block or panel caving    1  introduction  block cave mining has drawn increasing attention in recent years because it permits the bulk extraction of low grade ore bodies in a cost effective manner  the cave propagation of a jointed rock mass is strongly governed by the frictional characteristics of the geological discontinuities and in particular, joints in rock  therefore, explicit and accurate formulation towards the shear behaviour of joints avails prediction of rock mass caving   amongst many contributing factors, surface roughness plays a key role in the friction between joint walls  on one hand, roughness dilatancy serves as an important stabilizing effect  two contacting bodies tend to separate during tangential movement due to the sliding of asperity surfaces of one body on the other  when the increase in contact surface volume is constrained, dilatancy augments normal stresses compressing joint walls, which in turn, can significantly increase a joint’s resistance  the asperity surfaces responsible for dilation, however, will degrade and affect the subsequent shear behaviour depending on the normal stress level and the mount of sliding   goldstein et al[1] and patton [2] are among those who first attempted to predict the shear strength of non-planar rock joints based on the dilation caused by asperities  thenceforth, the dilative feature of rock fractures has been addressed in both empirical and theoretical approaches by numerous researchers such as ladanyi and archambault [3], barton [4], schneider [5], leichnitz [6], plesha [7], jing et al[8], wibowo [9] and oh et al[10]   the joint surfaces are irregular in nature; the roughness degree has been interpreted using statistical and fractal approaches [11-19]  as joint asperities degrade in shear, the surface damage has been investigated by several researchers based on the aforementioned methods including gentier et al[20], homand et al[21], grasselli and egger [22], belem et al[23] and jiang et al[24]  it seems that complete descriptions on asperity degradation are absent from those models because only geometric changes are taken into account  however, other factors such as normal stress magnitude and material strength are closely associated with the surface damage [25-28]   this paper presents a tribological relationship for joint asperity degradation based on the theory of wear  by dimensional analysis, factors affecting asperity deterioration including the applied stress and joint strength are taken into account  examples are considered comparing the proposed model to experimental data | 
2015-020 	 a finite element technique with triangular gird split method for hydraulic fracture propagation simulation in reservoirs |abstract  the fracture propagation simulation is extensively studied analytically and numerically since the hydraulic fracturing is widely used for the exploitation of unconventional reservoir resources  especially, the fracture propagation in natural fractured reservoirs often behaves twist and curved trajectories, so the fracture orientation and propagation path determination need more computational work in fracture tip stress field analysis in current finite element models  this paper describes a new finite element approach solving hydraulic fracture propagation by triangular gird split method (tmsm)  this approach uses interaction integral to compute the mix-mode (opening and sliding modes) stress intensity factors, and the vector cross-product is applied on the split element position  the arbitrary fracture propagation angle is obtained through the maximum tangential stress criterion  thus, the fracture dynamic propagation simulation can be achieved by the local unit of the fracture tip through mesh split or node movement  because the fracture can grow along the mesh boundary or split one element, so this approach allows the fracture propagation path without the initial pre-determined meshes control  in the cases of classical fracture propagation and fracture interference analysis between adjacent fractures, the efficiency and accuracy of this approach was validated comparing the existing mesh reconstruction method  the results show that this approach can simulate fracture growth exactly at more complex stress circumstances with the advantage of no singular element construction and local mesh refinement at fracture tips  the relative computational efficiency makes this approach can be applied for better description of fracture propagation problems in complex naturally fractured reservoirs   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a widely applied engineering technology  it plays an important role in many fields, such as petroleum stimulation, rock burst prevention, in-situ stress measurement and geothermal development et al  especially, with the development of shale gas reservoirs, the novel concept of srv (stimulated reservoir volume) has been put forward, which aims to form a complex fracture network rather than single elliptical fracture [1, 2]  thus, the hydraulic fracture design not only describes hydraulic fracture propagation accurately but also should be computationally efficient for engineering  however, the fracture propagation mechanical law and the intercoupling mechanisms between fracturing fluid and rock matrix in hydraulic fracturing treatment under complicated geological conditions remains a research challenge in current technology [3,4,5] | 
2015-022 	 numerical study of the influence of fluid viscosity on wellbore spalling in drained fractured rock |abstract  the objective of this work is to model the influence of shear stresses induced by viscous fluid flow on wellbore spalling  we simulated a drop of stress and pore pressure at the wall of a meter-scale borehole with a plane strain finite element model  the rock mass was modeled as a jointed continuum  block sliding was predicted from the tangential displacements in the joint after the shear failure criterion was reached  simulations show that: (1) higher far field stresses induce more normal stress in the joints, which prevents the occurrence of shear plastic strains in the joints and reduces block sliding at the wall; (2) shear stresses and consequent shear plastic strains that are induced by viscous fluid flow in the joints are higher for higher fluid viscosities, and decrease over time as the blocks on each side of the joint slide on each other; (3) in joints that are in contact with the borehole, a change of one order of magnitude in the fluid viscosity results in a change in joint shear stress by a factor of 2  results suggest that if drainage had been simulated over a longer period of time or for a smaller borehole diameter, the failure criterion would have been reached on a larger zone around the borehole, which could have a critical impact on the risk of borehole spalling  the numerical approach proposed in this work is expected to be useful to recommend wellbore operation modes so as to avoid excessive spalling and clogging   1  introduction  fractures existing prior to, or induced by drilling play a determinant role in spalling and block detachment during the stages of fluid injection and withdrawal in quasibrittle rocks (e g , shale)  both numerical simulation and in situ investigation have proved that the mechanical instability resulting in block detachment is affected by the orientation of fractures in reference to the principal direction of in situ stress [1, 2] and to the borehole axis [3, 4]  the fluid pressure difference induced by fluid flow around the borehole - especially in the fractures - also plays a primary role on the stability of blocks [5, 6]  as a matter of fact, the fluid present in the fractures applies a normal force on blocks faces, which disturbs the mechanical equilibrium of these blocks  in addition, viscous fluid flow generates shear stresses on fracture and block faces, which can also affect the mechanical stability of the blocks  to our best knowledge, these shear effects have not been estimated or taken into account in previous studies  the objective of this work is to model the influence of shear stresses induced by viscous fluid flow on wellbore spalling  we model the rock mass as a jointed continuum, in plane strain, with porofis finite element program [7]  constitutive laws used for the bulk and joint materials are explained in section 2  joint elements are assigned a plastic model coupled to a failure criterion, which allows predicting the relative displacements of the blocks  we simulate a pore pressure drop at the borehole wall  parametric studies on the ratio far field stress to initial pore pressure and on fluid viscosity are presented in section 3  conclusions on the risks of borehole spalling are drawn in section 4 | 
2015-026 	 numerical modelling of salt leaching-dissolution process |abstract  extraction of salt by leaching process is used intensively nowadays  this process extracts salt by dissolving the mineral with water  in this analysis about cavity dissolution modeling, we consider the case of a binary system, i e , a chemical solute corresponding to the solid that is dissolved by a “solvent” (mainly water)  rock salt dissolution is controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface, i e , equality of the chemical potentials  in this paper, a local non-equilibrium diffuse interface model (dim) and an explicit treatment of the brine-salt interface (using an ale (arbitrary lagrangian-eulerian) technique) are introduced in order to solve such dissolution problems  the control equations are obtained by upscaling micro-scale equations for a solid-liquid dissolution problem using a volume averaging theory  based on this mathematical formulation, dissolution test cases are presented  we introduce and discuss the main features of the method  illustrations of the interaction between natural convection and forced convection in dissolution problems are presented and the time and space evolution of the rock salt-fluid interface is shown through several examples   1  introduction  dissolution of porous media or solids is widely concerned in many industrial fields, e g , acid injection into petroleum reservoirs, dissolution of rocks caused by underground water, etc  in the latter, rock dissolution creates underground cavities of different shapes and sizes, which induces a potential risk of collapse as shown in fig 1  in most applications, modeling such liquid/solid dissolution problems is of paramount importance   among all methods used for modeling dissolution process, we present two ways for simulating this problem  the first one is a direct treatment of the evolution of the fluid-solid interface, for instance using an ale (arbitrary lagrangian-eulerian) method [4]  the second uses a diffuse interface model (dim) to smooth the interface with continuous quantities [1, 3, 6 ], like the liquid phase volume fraction, species mass fractions, etc   however, there are several difficulties associated with ale method for the dissolution problem: in particular, the need for fine meshes near the dissolving interface can lead to severely deformed grid elements inducing numerical problems (instabilities, need for remeshing, etc ) | 
2015-027 	 microscopic observations of shale deformation from in-situ deformation experiments conducted under a scanning electron microscope |abstract  we deformed organic-samples from the alum shale, denmark, under the scanning electron microscope (sem) using a deformation stage to observe the micromechanical deformation occurring during fracturing and creep deformation  in the first set of experiments, a disc-shaped sample was compressed to observe the formation of a mode i fracture as in a brazilian disc test  in most cases, we were able to see the formation of a thin opening fracture before the macroscopic failure by a through-going fracture  tensile strengths estimated from the mechanical data are in good agreement with those from normal-scale brazilian disc tests  in another configuration, a rectangular sample was compressed under controlled loads in order to observe the elastic and creep deformation of the shale samples  digital image correlation (dic) analysis using the acquired microscope images show that elastic deformation within the rock is spatially heterogeneous as expected, but also the creep deformation occurs in a heterogeneous manner  organic materials in the shale appear to be relatively compliant compared to other mineral components for both elastic and ductile deformation  while difficulties exist in capturing images during the deformation processes, these attempts give additional insights to the micromechanical processes governing the brittle and ductile deformation of shales    1  introduction  revealing the micromechanical processes that occur during rock deformation can help understand the macroscopic mechanical behavior observed during rock mechanics experiment and its controls  in brittle fracturing, observations of the gradual coalescence of acoustic micro-fractures revealed the gradual damage accumulation prior to rock failure and lead to damage rheology models which can quantify the gradual loss of stiffness as rocks approach failure [1, 2]  it is also common in ductile deformation of rocks that certain relatively weak phases in the rock dictate the overall strength of a rock as evidenced by strain localization features observed frequently in geological samples [3]   in this study, we investigate the possibility of visually observing the micromechanical deformation process by conducting in-situ deformation experiments under the scanning electron microscope (sem) and applying digital image correlation (dic) analysis to the acquired digital images  dic has been applied to rock mechanics studies primarily utilizing optical images [4-6] but still rarely with sem images due to technical challenges [7]  utilization of sem images has the advantage of greatly enhancing the magnification while challenges lie in the longer image acquisition times and image instability compared to optical images   we apply this technique to characterize the micromechanical deformation of organic-rich shales  shales are characterized by a fine heterogeneous fabric which makes it difficult to observe deformation structures by simply comparing microscope images of pre- and post-deformed samples  moreover, shales are clay-rich poly-mineralic rocks suggestive of complicated rheological behaviors  laboratory studies have shown the mixed brittle-ductile behavior of these rocks even at unsaturated room temperature conditions suggested to be mainly dependent on the amount of clay and organic contents [8, 9]  however, much remains unclear including the exact physical mechanism responsible for these deformational behaviors  thus a direct observation identifying the mineral constituent responsible for the overall behavior would enhance our understanding and capability to predict the long-term rheological behavior of these rocks  such insights are of great importance for engineering purposes as ductile shale behavior is related to the stress variations observed in shale gas reservoirs [10] and shales are considered as potential sites for nuclear waste disposals [11] | 
2015-028 	 behavior of salt from the bayou choctaw salt dome |abstract  a laboratory testing program was developed to examine the short-term mechanical and time-dependent (creep) behavior of salt from the bayou choctaw salt dome  core was tested under creep and quasi-static constant mean stress axisymmetric compression, and constant mean stress axisymmetric extension conditions  creep tests were performed at 38 degrees celsius, and the axisymmetric tests were performed at ambient temperatures (22-26 degrees celsius)  the testing performed indicates that the dilation criterion is pressure and stress state dependent  it was found that as the mean stress increases, the shear stress required to cause dilation increases  the results for this salt are reasonably consistent with those observed for other domal salts  also it was observed that tests performed under extensile conditions required consistently lower shear stress to cause dilation for the same mean stress, which is consistent with other domal salts  young’s modulus ranged from 27 2 to 58 7 gpa with an average of 44 4 gpa, with poisson’s ratio ranging from 0 10 to 0 43 with an average of 0 30  creep testing indicates that the bc salt is intermediate in creep resistance when compared with other bedded and domal salt steady-state behavior    1  introduction  sandia national laboratories, on behalf of the u s  department of energy (doe), is evaluating the mechanical integrity of the salt pillars surrounding existing petroleum storage caverns in the bayou choctaw dome (louisiana) that are part of the u s  strategic petroleum reserve (spr)  the purpose of this experimental effort is to better characterize the salt strength, dilational strength and creep in the salt section above cavern 102 and below the overlying abandoned caverns, where casing issues have been observed [1]   the core used for this experimental study was obtained from a drill hole from depths of 325 to 335 meters below ground surface (bgs) and is above one of the bayou choctaw spr caverns  for reference the top of the salt dome lies between 183 and 213 meters bgs, and the total depth is over 3050 meters bgs  the natural rock salt deposits used in the spr are ideal for storage of crude oil because of their low (nearly zero) permeability, ease of mining, and proximity to shipping and refining operations   the mechanical behavior of rock salt is relatively unique when compared with other geologic media due to the well-known ability of salt to show significant time dependent deformation without fracturing when subjected to differential stresses [2]  this can result in the closure of caverns and mines over time, which results in reduced storage in the case of caverns  under some differential stress states salt is known to dilate due to stress-induced microfracturing [3]   in this work elastic properties and dilation behavior were determined by performing constant mean stress axisymmetric compression (asc) and axisymmetric extension (ase) tests  creep properties were determined using standard constant differential stress creep tests  while the composition of the salt used in this testing was not quantitatively determined, it was determined, from visual observation, that the salt is relatively pure halite with impurities comprising less than 2-4% by volume  impurities appeared to be anhydrite  | 
2015-030 	 advances in the use of new-age complex fracture modeling, earth modeling, and reservoir simulation tools as an asset well planning tool |abstract  advances in complex fracture modeling have provided multiple realizations of the development of fracture networks in unconventional reservoirs  this has allowed for calibrated fracture network geometry definition in reservoirs that are conducive to fracture network growth in multiple directions as a result of the presence of natural fractures and low horizontal stress anisotropy  the ability to predict fracture network creation has allowed for fracturing design that focuses on net pressure development to achieve the desired complexity  increases in fracture complexity can result in increased production results in low permeability unconventional reservoirs with two-phase hydrocarbon production  while this capability has led to positive results, there is a desire within the unconventional arena to increase the collaborative development of assets for even greater improvement and increased understanding of optimized exploitation of these assets  for this reason, the ability to include the realizations of complex fracture networks in a three-dimensional (3d) asset description would prove invaluable to asset development and well planning and further increase understanding across various disciplines  the need to incorporate results of complex fracture modeling and geomechanical descriptions within an earth model led to the development of an analysis process combining the results of multi-disciplinary modeling techniques focused on unconventional assets   1  introduction  1 1  complex fracture modeling capabilitieswith advances in hydraulic fracture modeling aimed at describing the fracture development in unconventional plays, the ability to describe “non-typical” fracture network growth has improved significantly [3]  with this type of modeling, it is possible to observe fracture network patterns that include hydraulically induced fractures, which are induced and propagated in the direction of the maximum horizontal stress, as has been understood for some time  additionally, fracture network growth that can be leakoff induced or stress induced and includes the development of fractures oblique to the maximum horizontal stress is now possible  understanding fracture network growth and these patterns is becoming more important in unconventional plays having a geological setting conducive to this behavior, which often results in fracture networks that are much more complex than a simple bi-wing fracture  this modeling tool’s ability to map and describe these types of fracture networks allows for better completions optimization and the development of workflows that collaborate across geoscience and engineering disciplines to help maximize asset value | 
2015-036 	 experimental investigation on the effect of pore pressure on rock permeability-bakken formation case |abstract  over the past decade, shale oil becomes an important source of oil across the north america  bakken shale, one of the largest shale oil plays in the word, is producing about one million barrel oil per day  the main methods exploiting bakken oil are drilling horizontal wells with multi-fracturing technology  unfortunately, the oil rate declines rapidly from the initial high production  this decline is in part due to the deterioration of permeability resulting from the depletion of reservoir  engineers and geoscientists cannot evaluate the relationship between permeability and pore pressure confidently without a permeability-pore pressure correlation developed from experimental data, although it is in general known that permeability declines as pore pressure is reduced  in this study, a large database was provided after the permeability were measured at different confining and pore pressure conditions for more than forty bakken core samples  the significance of this study are: (1) measured data can be incorporated into reservoir model to simulate the reservoir performance to accurately forecast production from bakken; (2) provided a correlation to calculate permeability as a function of pore pressure; (3) served as a guidance in analyzing other shale gas and oil plays whose reservoir characteristics are similar to bakken formation   1  introduction  the bakken formation is a large unconventional reservoir in the williston basin, and covers parts of montana, north dakota, and saskatchewan  the late devonian to early mississippian bakken formation consists of three members, the lower, middle, and upper  the upper and lower members are organic-rich shale, and the middle member contains sandstone, limestone, and dolostone [1]   even though approximately 200 to 400 billion barrels of oil were generated [1] in bakken formation, the main method to exploit bakken oil is drilling horizontal wells with multi-fracturing technology due to low permeability of bakken formation  however, the oil rate declines rapidly from the initial high production  this decline is in part due to the deterioration of permeability resulting from the depletion of reservoir [2]  knowledge of the effect of pore pressure on the permeability of bakken formation is necessary in producing the hydrocarbon from bakken shale | 
2015-037 	 teaching subsidence concepts with a physical modeling device |abstract  a subsidence simulation system using displacement measurement techniques based on opto-electronic displacement measurement sensors has recently been developed, introduced for subsidence engineering education purpose  the results of subsidence analysis define subsidence parameters including angle draws, angle of break, subsidence factors, etc  subsidence profiles are determined in mathematical forms  the outcomes is useful in helping understand field subsidence mechanism and simulations and enhance the teaching of subsidence concepts such as angle of draw, angle of break and subsidence factors to undergraduate student class  the developed subsidence modeling device also helps reinforce lateral stress pressure and soil shear strength estimation from the subsidence modeling   1  introduction  subsidence damages surface and subsurface structures such as foundations, utility lines, infrastructures, ground water regimes, etc  subsidence is not a far and away issue only in other states, it also happens in indiana  as shown in the fig  1, some southwestern counties of indiana have some subsidence concerns [1]  in order to avoid or reduce subsidence damages, it is imperative to know the subsidence characteristics of the particular site, and proper design work has to be performed to prevent or minimize subsidence hazards   there are two types of subsidence [2]: 1) pit, also called sinkhole or pot hole, and 2) trough or sag  pit subsidence is characterized by an abrupt sinking of the surface, resulting in circular steep sided, crater-like features  trough subsidence is a gentle, gradual depression of the surface  subsidence is controlled by many factors, including width of unsupported cavity, height of cavity, thickness of overburden, strength and fracture system of rock, hydrology, and time [1, 2, 3]    in engineering geology class, undergraduate students are exposed to concepts the subsidence geohazards  to help them to visualize and understand the fundamental subsidence concepts and thus better prepared to minimize or prevent subsidence damage, it is necessary to understand subsidence phenomena  it is difficult to simulate or predict real subsidence development because of the complexity in physical characteristics such as rock failure and yield behavior, dimensional variations and time dependent behavior  | 
2015-038 	 mixed finite element method applied to non–euclidean model of inelastic deformations |abstract  rock behaviour frequently does not fit the classical theory of continuum mechanics because of rock aggregated granular structure  particularly, rock fracturing may be accompanied by zonal disintegration formation  the key to building the nonclassic model of rock fracturing is the granulated structure  deformations of solid bodies with microscopic flaws can be described within the scope of non-euclidean geometry, and non-trivial deformation incompatibility can be referred to as a fracture parameter  the new continuum model presented in this paper enables the prediction of the zones initializing and developing as a periodic structure  the non–euclidean description of phenomenon initiates an appearance of two new material constants  the coupled model must comprise the fourth–order parabolic equation on disintegration thermodynamic parameter be solved with the classical hyperbolic system of equations for the dynamics of continuous media  the 2d model of formation of disintegration zone was solved numerically  the zone magnitude and site that can be described by the term ‘disintegration scale’ are determined by values of new constants  therefore, the numerical model based on the new non-euclidean continuum model is capable of predicting formation of a disintegration field periodic structure   1  introduction  zonal disintegration in the mining industry began in the 1980s  the first observation of the phenomena in south africa was made by adams and jager [1] at 1980  later, shemyakin et al  [2, 3, 4] observed and described the same phenomena  glushikhin et al  [5] described a model experiment in a lab that reproduced the in–situ phenomena   the periodic changes of the fractured zone cannot be clearly explained by classic approaches of solid mechanics  the linear theory of elasticity enables the stresses for cylindrical excavation to be calculated  any of stress tensor components is a monotone function on an excavation boundary offset that provides the only possible fractured zone if certain rock-failure criteria is applied  to achieve the observed periodic structure using a classic approach, some redundant factors like the presence of specific hydrostatic pressure field must be available | 
2015-043 	 structural design of tunnel supports by combining a point estimate method with a deterministic numerical analysis code (flac2d) |abstract  the objective of this study is to propose an alternative way for the probabilistic structural design of tunnel supports in combination with a deterministic numerical analysis code, flac2d  we proposed an approach for linking a point estimate method to the flac2d solver and developed a software program, called tunnelra, which facilitates the probabilistic reliability assessment of tunnel supports  the validity of the present approach was investigated based on a lined-circular tunnel problem with an analytical solution and was demonstrated in the accurate estimation of the statistical moments of the performance functions related to the lined-tunnel  additionally, we applied the present approach to the structural design of a steel liner which is installed in a pressurized tunnel for storing compressed natural gas at a pressure of 15 mpa  in this application, we investigated the probability of failure for the steel liner by varying the liner’s strength and thickness, and provided information for decision making in structural design  the results of the present work demonstrated that the present numerical approach could be used for designing tunnel supports and for making relevant decisions in a quantitative manner   1  introduction  most of geotechnical parameters, such as the mechanical properties of soils and rocks, are uncertain  the uncertainties should be properly taken into account in geotechnical and structural designs  probabilistic approaches are more useful in dealing with the uncertainties than conventional deterministic approaches in which the geotechnical parameters are conservatively assigned as single-fixed values determined by a designer’s engineering judgment  probabilistic approaches quantify the geotechnical uncertainties by statistical probability distributions  as a result, the reliability of structures can be quantitatively assessed in terms of the probability of failure in a limit-state  regarding the probabilistic analysis of tunnel supports, there have been several researches such as laso et al  [1], li & low [2], and oreste [3]  for the probabilistic stability evaluation of tunnel supports, laso et al  [1] and li & low [2] used a ground-support interaction diagram for a circular excavated tunnel for which analytical solutions are available, but it is not possible to apply their approaches to non-circular tunnels  oreste [3] suggested a probabilistic approach for the reliability assessment of tunnel supports by using a hyperstatic reaction method  however, as indicated in his study, the hyperstatic reaction method has such limitations that the active loads which are applied to tunnel supports should be exactly evaluated and the normal and shear stiffness values between the surrounding ground and tunnel supports should be defined in advance  the previous studies have focused on the probability-based reliability assessment of tunnel supports using analytical solutions that can be applicable only to limited conditions, rather than combined with numerical methods that are more useful for solving a variety of underground problems with various shapes and analysis conditions | 
2015-044 	 weathering profiles of some sandstones from sunshine coast, australia – morphological and geotechnical approach |abstract  this paper presents the results of a study of the morphology of weathering profiles of some sandstones of sunshine coast, southeast queensland, australia  several cut slopes were analyzed in order to provide accurate knowledge of its morphological characteristics  from these, five outcrops were selected to a more detailed study focused on physical, geological, structural and geotechnical parameters, including several characteristics of the rock matrix and rock mass  samples from the upper portion of the profiles, into the transition zone between rock and soil, were collected in order to determine physical indices, preparation and description of thin sections, description of macroscopic characteristics and point load tests  the results show that sandstones weathering profiles are relatively thin and the contacts between different material layers are sharp  a strong structural conditioning of weathering can be noted in all outcrops  a remarkable characteristic of the weathering profiles is the presence of stress relief joints parallel to bedding, which plays an important role in the differentiation of rock mass layers and weathering  physical parameters, especially apparent porosity and density, have proved to be good indicators of weathering of rock matrix weathering   1  introduction  the importance of the study of weathering profiles is mainly related to the presence of transitional weathered materials between the rock and the soil, which present different geotechnical parameters and, as a consequence, different geotechnical behavior  the presence of these weathering profiles at a geotechnical work site such as cut slopes, foundations and open and underground excavations, drives geotechnical stability, as weathering produces material with extremely different mechanical parameters [1, 2, 3, 4 and 5]  add to this scenario is the presence of structural discontinuities that, besides influencing underground water circulation and hence weathering, introduces great variations in mechanical behavior  this context presents an important and complex geotechnical instability mechanism of rock masses that has been responsible for many geotechnical problems under different weathering (climatic) conditions | 
2015-048 	 application of rock physics in wellbore stability modeling for chayvo field multi-lateral erd wells |abstract  a large number of challenging erd wells have already been successfully drilled in the chayvo field using stability mud weights determined by a field-specific wellbore stability model  the original wellbore stability model was based on local insitu stresses, sonic log and shale surface area based rock strength correlations; this model was calibrated and validated against field experience  a key challenge identified in drilling chayvo multilateral erd wells was the reduced margin between the required higher stability mud weights and the depleted formation fracture gradient, compared to the original chayvo erd wells  additionally, a high quality borehole was essential for installation of the complex multilateral equipment  the challenge was to come up with a reliable method to determine rock strength along the horizontal boreholes, as data required to apply conventional methods was sparse  this provided the incentive to explore the rock physics methodology to generate synthetic sonic logs for a well-specific rock strength characterization  these synthetic logs were incorporated into the integrated hole quality and quantitative risk analysis (ihq-qra) technology to determine the optimum mud weights for chayvo horizontal multi-lateral wells  this paper describes how this approach resulted in successfully completing the complex chayvo field multilateral erd wells   1  introduction  in 2013, the chayvo field drilling program marked its 10th anniversary with a new world record erd well (measured depth 12,700 m) and by successfully drilling and completing russia’s most complex offshore multilateral erd well  a record-breaking well to a measured depth of 13,000m followed in 2014  multilateral technology enables increased production from a single well by drilling one or more additional boreholes into the reservoir from the original wellbore, or mainbore | 
2015-057 	 transferring the geomechanical behaviour of opalinus clay observed in lab tests and mont terri url to assess engineering feasibility at potential repository sites |abstract  opalinus clay is the designated host rock for high-level radioactive waste in switzerland  its geomechanical behavior during excavation works has been extensively studied over the past two decades at the underground research laboratory (url) at mont terri in northwestern switzerland  tunnel convergence measurements were compiled from 17 locations at the url, suggesting that diametral strain is strongly influenced by the rock mass anisotropy  monitoring of pore fluid pressure indicates strong hydro-mechanical coupling and potentially a large excavation damage zone (edz) up to several tunnel radii from the tunnel axis  transferring experiences gained at mont terri url to candidate repository sites over a large depth range some 50 to 100 km further to the east is complicated by several factors  these include stress-dependent mechanical properties of opalinus clay and different tectonic overprint between the url and the candidate regions  a pragmatic workflow was established to account for observations at the url, and drawing on geomechanical data from cores at the url and from wells at greater depths to evaluate engineering feasibility of repositories at different depths    1  introduction  opalinus clay was identified as the preferred host rock for spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste (sf/hlw) and as one possible host rock for long-lived and intermediate to low level waste (l/ilw) in switzerland  a total of five potential repository sites with opalinus clay as host rock are being evaluated in stage 2 of the swiss sectoral plan for deep geological repositories in a selection process  all these sites are located in northeastern switzerland, with potential storage depths in the range of approximately 400 to 900 m   as part of the process, the different sites must be evaluated based on criteria related to safety and technical feasibility  protection from erosional processes is considered a key criterion to specify a minimum depth for a potential repository  on the other hand engineering feasibility of underground structures is considered a key criterion to limit the maximum depth  in contrast to most other underground excavations, repository tunnels must not only meet standards related to operational safety and serviceability, but must also meet requirements stemming from considerations of long-term safety analysis of potential flow of radionuclides | 
2015-059 	 experimental and numerical 2d analysis of hydraulic fracturing using high-power electric discharge |abstract  studies of hydraulic fracturing in fractured porous medium have commonly been made using in-situ fracture pressure upon the fracture (wing-crack) surfaces  here we propose a novel technique, which may provide advantages such as increasing the rate of crude oil production from shallow to deep high pressure/high temperature reservoirs  more specifically, we show the results of numerical and experimental pulse power fracturing study in which the fracture propagation can be controlled, with application to unconventional reservoirs  in the experimental setup 1kj energy is produced during electric discharge  in the experiments, the pressure rose up to more than 100 kpsi (690 mpa), high enough for generating numerous new fractures  we have run several tests on cylindrical specimens of limestone and shale, each specimen being 15 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter  the results show that the measured fracture propagation rate using this method is considerably higher than we using conventional quasi static fracture propagation methods  further field scale tests on this method are required to determine maximum fracture lengths   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is one of the well-known standard operations after perforation in oil and gas wells, especially for unconventional reservoirs  one idea might be to use high injection pressure to create a simple two wings hydraulic fracture  however, such a method requires the use great volumes of fluid and increases the risk of propagation into underground water sources   such disadvantages have led researchers to try to find novel methods for hydraulic fracture operations by joining several new ideas derived from basic solid mechanics and fluid dynamics  one of the most important and novel methods in this context is hydropulse pressure fracturing  this is a dynamic fracture propagation method in which the excessive pressure is produced using an electrical discharge  in fact, unlike the traditional quasi-static fracture propagation, this method has the advantage of creating a two-wing planar hydraulic fracture  it is a dynamic fracture propagation method and is applicable in naturally fractured reservoirs  creating multiple fractures is also possible with this method based on the power which was used | 
2015-065 	 true-triaxial hydraulic fracturing of niobrara carbonate rock as an analogue for complex oil and gas reservoir stimulation |abstract  well stimulation by hydraulic fracturing is a common method for increasing the injectivity and productivity of wells  this method is beneficial for many applications including oil, gas, geothermal energy and co2sequestration, however, hydraulic fracturing in shale and other similarly complex geologies remains poorly understood  a 300<u+00d7>300<u+00d7>300 mm3block specimen of fort hays limestone was hydraulically fractured in the laboratory using a true-triaxial apparatus to study complex hydraulic fracturing  this material is a member of the niobrara shale formation, a major unconventional oil and gas play in the denver-julesburg basin  hydraulic fractures were stimulated by injection of plastic epoxy  injected epoxy clearly marked the fluid penetrated zones of the stimulated fractures, partially preserved the in-situ fracture aperture and bonded the fracture faces to give improved visualization of complex fractures in cross-sections cut after the experiment  the experiment resulted with a complex fracture network including prominent tensile hydraulic fractures, shear activated discontinuities and bedding plane separations  acoustic emissions, injection pressures and injection rates were analyzed with reference to the fracture geometry to develop relationships between these parameters and to develop means of identifying complex fracture growth, as applicable in field scenarios where the actual fracture geometry is not easily measured    1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation method where fluid is injected into rock to create new fractures  these fractures are intended to function as high-conductivity fluid pathways enabling increased well productivity or injectivity  the hydraulic fracturing method can be used to improve oil, gas, geothermal, carbon sequestration, and deep waste injection well performance  design and optimization of a hydraulic fracture treatment is non-trivial due to complexity stemming from multi-physical interactions between the in-situ rock and injected fluids   a comprehensive understanding of hydraulic fracture geometry is critical for understanding and predicting fluid flow behavior through stimulated wells  fracture geometries in field treatments are expected to be complex, including combinations of tensile and shear fractures [1,2]  this expectation is supported by mine-back studies [3,4] and microseismic monitoring where acoustic emission (ae) sources are typically dispersed through a volume of rock and do not clearly indicate discrete fractures  some stimulation treatments are thought to produce complex networks of inter-connected fractures, accessing large rock volumes | 
2015-066 	 an analytical boundary condition for d3q19 lattice boltzmann model |abstract  based on the principles of bouncing back the non-equilibrium parts of particle populations in the normal direction and momentum preservation, zou & he [phys fluids 9(1997)] proposed and validated a set of analytical pressure and velocity boundary conditions for the d2q9 and d3q15 lbgk models  in this article, the analytical pressure and velocity face boundary conditions are explicitly extended to the d3q19 lbgk model, following the same methodology  the correctness and accuracy of the derived boundary conditions are verified in steady duct flow problem and unsteady stokes’ second problem; in both problems the numerical solutions are compared well with the analytical solutions    1  introduction  over the last two decades, the lattice boltzmann method (lbm) has been emerging as an important computational fluid dynamics (cfd) technique for modeling nearly incompressible fluid flows and simulating physics of fluids, especially when interfacial dynamics and complex boundaries are involved [1,2]  unlike the direct discretization of navier-stokes equations in the traditional cfd approaches, such as finite difference, finite volume and finite element methods, in lbm packets of fluid particles move across the lattice following simple but special kinetic rules at the mesoscale such that the relations among macroscopic variables of fluids automatically recover navier-stokes equations [3]    the mesoscopic kinetic nature of lbm brings many advantages over the conventional cfd methods, such as simplicity of the implementation algorithm, capacity of handling complex physical mechanisms, ease of parallelization, etc  on the other hand, the mesoscopic nature of lbm makes it awkward to implement boundary conditions  in traditional continuum-based cfd methods, the common velocity and pressure conditions (or their derivatives) can be imposed to the boundaries directly (or after simple straightforward discretization)  in lbm, however, the boundary conditions described by macroscopic variables have to be appropriately translated into the equivalent conditions in term of mesoscopic quantities and enforced at the mesoscale  in this translation procedure, the mathematical relations among the macroscopic variables (e g , density and velocities) and the mesoscopic quantities (particle distributions) must be satisfied and the known particle distributions need to be respected  since the number of unknown particle distributions is greater than the number of mathematical macroscopicmesoscopic relations, additional physical or numerical rules need to be introduced to determine the unknown particle distributions  examples of such additional rules include momentum preservation, local thermohydrodynamic equilibrium, finite difference extrapolation [4-8] | 
2015-068 	 experimental study of fracture initiation and propagation from a wellbore |abstract  in this work, a special device that can simulate plane-strain condition is designed to observe the fracture initiation and propagation directly in a rock plate specimen  the confining pressures are used to simulate the influences of in-situ stresses, and the pre-cracks are for perforations  an opening device can switch hydraulic pump pressure on the boundary of the center hole, which produces a tensile stress on the pre-cracks and initiates their propagation  it needs to note that the influences of fluid are not considered in the experiments, due to the limit of difficulties of sealing issues  several experiments were conducted using the device under different confining pressures and perforation angles  the experimental results showed that when the confining pressures and the perforation angles were small, the fractures initiated from the pre-cracks and propagated along the maximum confining stress  as the confining pressures and perforation angles increased, the fractures initiated from center hole of rock specimen rather than pre-cracks  based on the maximum tensile stress criterion, the numerical analyses matched the experimental results well    1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing treatments have become an indispensable part of stimulating in shale gas and other unconventional reservoirs  however, they can be greatly influenced by the selected perforating parameters  especially, the initiation and propagation of fracture in the near wellbore region will influence the development of fractures, and finally the treatments of hydraulic fracturing [1, 2]  thus, the identification of fracture path during the hydraulic fracturing will provide the fundamental information that can help to improve the hydraulic fracturing treatments   many researchers have studied the influence factors on the fractures evolution near wellbore, and the results showed that perforating parameters, cement properties and confining pressure are the key factors [3-6]  for instance, the initiation pressure and hydraulic fracture reorientation path are controlled by the perforation orientation [7]  when the confining stress and perforating angle increased, the initiation from perforations became difficult and finally initiated from weak cemented position | 
2015-069 	 acoustic emission monitoring of laboratory scale hydraulic fracturing experiments |abstract  during the past years a better understanding of the fracturing processes to enhance productivity in hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs has become more important for the industry  within this context hydraulic fracturing type experiments on 150 mm edge length cube shaped blocks with a 13 mm diameter central borehole under different true-triaxial confining stresses up to 20 mpa have been conducted in this study  deformations and acoustic emission (ae) were monitored throughout the experiments  rock types that have been tested comprise rhyolites, sandstones and slates with low porosity and permeability  fracturing has been conducted with water as a fracturing fluid and via pressurization of an elastic polymer sleeve to eliminate poroelastic effects  ae data evaluation revealed several characteristics of fracture initiation and propagation as ’trapping’ and ’deflection’ of the induced fractures at pre-existing fractures, branching and deviation of the induced fracture away from the expected orientation, differences in source types as well as fracture propagation parallel to the borehole  also the activation of pre-existing fractures prior to fracture initiation and different kinds of fracture initiation patterns were observable   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is applied in a broad range of applications as in hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoir productivity enhancement, stress measurements or stress relief in e g  tunneling  within this range of applications companies are confronted with changing lithological material properties, stress magnitudes, fracture dimensions and public vulnerability in the case of induced seismicity  the process of hydraulic fracturing is well understood for homogeneous and isotropic media [1]  most rocks exhibit a certain degree of heterogeneity and anisotropy caused by bedding, cleavage or pre-existing discontinuities as joints or faults  for field hydraulic fracturing operations the dimensions of the induced fractures can be in similar dimensional scale to the before mentioned attributes  therefore, fracture propagation direction, fracture geometry and injection pressures may be strongly affected by anisotropy [2]    since the late 1970`s hydraulic fracturing experiments are conducted in the laboratory in combination with ae monitoring [3, 4, 5]  throughout the decades ae monitoring of laboratory hydraulic fracturing experiments became more and more sophisticated by incorporating methods known from disciplines like seismology, seismics and non-destructive testing  these methods comprise precise arrivaltime detection algorithms [6, 7], different localization approaches allowing for anisotropic velocity fields [8, 9, 10], collapsing techniques [11, 12, 13], source type evaluation methods [14], couplants [15] and ae-tomography approaches [16, 17]  furthermore, the availability of affordable monitoring hardware gave rise to the usage of the ae monitoring technique for laboratory experiments in geosciences | 
2015-070 	 xfem-based czm for the simulation of 3d multiple-stage hydraulic fracturing in quasi-brittle shale formations |abstract  in this work, we modeled double- and triple-cluster 3d hydraulic fracturing in a single-layer, quasi-brittle shale formation using planar czm and xfem-based czm including slit flow and poro-elasticity for fracture and matrix spaces, respectively, in abaqus  our fully-coupled pore pressure-stress geo-mechanics model includes leak-off as a continuum-based fluid flow component coupled with the other unknowns in the problem  having compared the triple-cluster fracturing results from planar czm with those from xfem-based czm, we found that the stress shadowing effect of multiple hydraulic fractures on each other can cause these fractures to rationally propagate out of plane; this also demonstrates the advantages of the second method compared to the first one  we investigated the effect of this arbitrary propagation direction on not only the fractures’ length, aperture, and the required injection pressure, but also fractures’ connection to the wellbore  depending on the spacing and the number of clusters per stage, this connection can be gradually disrupted with time due to the near-wellbore fracture closure which may embed proppant particles on the fracture wall, or screen out the fracture at early stimulation times  comparing all studied cases, we concluded that the double-cluster, simultaneous fracturing with 100-ft spacing provides the most viable fracture set for long-term production   1  introduction  shale gas resources have profoundly contributed to the prospective independence of the u s  on oil and gas from foreign resources  the abundant condensate gas production and export from the u s  shale resources have significantly contributed in the global sharp oil price decline since august 2014 [1]  these resources are known as ultra-low permeable, organic-rich formations with desorption of gas as a major but slow-rate and long-lasting producing mechanism  economic production from these resources through gas desorption requires a complex network of natural fractures connected to the producing horizontal wellbores by hydraulic fractures in multiple stages, the most common stimulation technology in shale gas reservoirs  the geometry of hydraulic fractures (length, height, aperture, and propagation pattern) significantly contributes to long-term gas production and is inspected roughly by post-fracturing data acquisition methods such as tiltmeter fracturing mapping and micro-seismic monitoring [2]  this later method, however, cannot identify opening-mode or hydraulic fractures since the only detectable events using this method are shear slippage events  the technical restrictions on the hydraulic fracture data acquisition, the limitation on the extendibility of a successful fracturing job data to the other fields [3], and the high cost of re-stimulation plans, if possible, urge to develop numerical tools for optimal hydraulic fracturing design  furthermore, due to the occurrence of cap rock and shale gas reservoir in close proximity and the environmental concerns about ground water contamination by fracturing jobs, the induced fractures need to be cautiously placed in order not to propagate into the upper and lower geological layers  such a rigorous hydraulic fracture design in shale rocks demands numerical optimizing tools which should also be versatile for a variety of shale formations in mineralogy and stress state and capture increasingly more complex fracture networks than expected in these resources [2, 4]  furthermore, a long-term optimum fracture spacing depends on not only the above parameters during fracturing, but also the fluid phase behavior during production in the commonly identified gas condensate windows in shale resources such as eagle ford [5], which is out of the scope of our geo-mechanical study | 
2015-072 	 evaluation techniques of wellbore stability on complex formation based on wettability |abstract  wettability of rock and drilling fluid attracts great attention, especially in the field of micro scale on wellbore stability  the core samples from western china were investigated using x-ray diffraction tests, water activity tests, wetting test, field emission scanning electron microscope tests and uniaxial compressive strength tests  the results indicate that wettability has a great influence on micrometer or even nanometer cracks, the stress accumulated by which affects micro fractures extension, whereas traditional theory had ignored usually  according to the mineral composition and wettability of the samples, and the changes of the microscope structure and rock mechanics parameters resulted from the samples contacting with oil-based drilling fluid, a comprehensive fracture mechanics model between rock and drilling fluid based on wettability was proposed  the model indicates that the fractures extension was a combined action result of the opening and sliding mode cracks, and that the stress intensity factors were affected by in-situ stress, net fluid pressure, wettability, and even fracture geometry  wettability was used as an effective solution to the frequent occurrence of the wellbore instability in fractured formation, even under the density and conventional performances of oil-based drilling fluid within a reasonable range   1  introduction  wettability is defined as the tendency of one fluid to spread on or adhere to a solid surface in the presence of other immiscible fluids, which is the fluid's ability to keep contacting with the solid surface, and is caused by the molecular interaction when the fluid and the solid contact with each other [1, 2]  as the research on wellbore stability proceeds gradually in the drilling engineering field, the influence of the wettability on rock attracts great attention  in the 1980s, anderson, w g  made a systematic summary of relevant literatures on the wettability, including rock/oil/brine interactions and the effects of core handling on wettability [3], wettability measurement [4], the effects of wettability on the electrical properties of porous media [5], the effects of wettability on capillary pressure [6], the effects of wettability on relative permeability [7], and the effects of wettability on waterflooding [8]  at the present time, the study on the wellbore stability has entered the microcosmic field [9], and the role of the wettability in this scale is highlighted significantly   wettability not only controls reservoir fluid distribution, but also greatly affects physical and chemical properties of rock, including capillary force, relative permeability, electrical properties and even strength  especially before and after drilling formation, wettability exerts a more significant influence on wellbore stability  in most previous literatures, unchanged wettability was considered as a default premise, impact of wettability and its changes on the rock, thereby on wellbore stability was ignored | 
2015-073 	 a new stacked height growth model for hydraulic fracturing simulation |abstract  the majority of planar hydraulic fracture models use two distinct approaches  the first one, referred to as the planar 3d model, is more accurate but also very cpu intensive  the second one is referred to pseudo-3d (p3d) model, and separately considers the vertical growth and horizontal propagation of the fractures  this approach is less cpu intensive, but requires the fracture being initiated in the lower stress layer  in practice, this assumption is not always verified, and the fracture height growth can become unstable  this paper presents a new model as an enhancement of the p3d, which consists of multiple rows of elements vertically stacked and connected  for each row of elements, the assumption of the fracture front being in the lower stress layer is satisfied locally  the width profile and stress intensity factor at the top and bottom of the fracture depend on the stress profile and the pressure profile along the stack of elements  this model predicts the fracture height more accurately than the p3d model, and gives results close to the ones from the full planar 3d model    1  introduction  the rapid development of shale resources in the past decade has brought a focus on the process of hydraulic fracturing  shale reservoirs tend to be characterized by a complex 3d stress field and vertically heterogeneous mechanical properties, which have always been challenging for hydraulic fracturing modeling and particularly for properly predicting the shape of an induced fracture [1]  most state-of-the-art planar fracture simulators use two distinct approaches  in the first one, referred to as the planar 3d model (pl3d), the fracture is assumed to be a plane and its entire footprint is discretized into elements  the equations governing fluid flow, elasticity, and mass balance are solved numerically, coupled with the fracture propagation rules  this approach is very accurate but also very cpu intensive [2]  this type of model is mostly used when a large portion of the fracture propagates outside of the zone where the fracture was initiated and significant amount of vertical flow is expected  the second approach is based on the cell-based pseudo-3d (p3d) model [3], which separately considers the vertical growth and horizontal propagation of the fractures  in this approach, the width profile and fracture height are calculated based solely on the local pressure and local vertical stress profile  this approach is less cpu intensive, but relies on several assumptions including the fracture being initiated and its leading front propagating in the lower stress layer compared to the neighboring layers above and below  if this is not the case, the fracture height growth can become unstable, since it is not directly correlated to the global fracture mass balance as in the pl3d model, and this can lead to significant inaccuracy in the predicted fracture height growth | 
2015-074 	 hydraulic fracture design optimization for infill wells: an integrated geomechanics workflow |abstract  natural fractures can reactivate upon stimulation and interact with propagating hydraulic fractures  this interaction usually creates complex, productive fracture networks that can remain open during production  geomechanical models quantify key parameters that control the extent and characteristics of the conductive reservoir area in naturally fractured reservoirs  the models can be utilized to optimize stimulation design parameters for infill wells or re-fracturing operations  in this paper we present stimulation design optimization within the framework of a coupled “geomechanics-microseismic-reservoir-discrete fracture network (dfn)” workflow  a series of simulations are conducted to understand key parameters that control the conductive reservoir area of a planned infill well  in these simulations both stimulation design parameters (e g  pumping rate) and well architecture (e g  stage number, well orientation) are varied as their impact on conductive reservoir area is quantified  results show that extent of conductive reservoir area in a naturally fractured reservoir can be controlled  the workflow introduced in this paper can guide field operations and optimize stimulation design to (i) maximize conductive reservoir area of an infill well (ii) and limit/control fracture communication between infill wells and existing producers   1  introduction  hydraulic fracture (hf) characteristics and geometry are a complex function of in-situ stress state, stress shadowing, formation anisotropy, rate and pressure dependent rock mechanical properties, wellbore orientation, and the natural fracture networks [1-5]  in particular, the presence of natural fractures and their interaction with propagating hydraulic fractures can dictate the resulting fracture network patterns and the extent of conductive reservoir area [3-7]   in naturally fractured reservoirs, this interaction can create complex fracture network geometries as observed from microseismic (ms) data [4, 8-10]  however, in most commercial hydraulic fracturing simulators, fracture path is predefined and planar (fig  1)  this is an oversimplification of the real processes (in particular for horizontal wells), in which multiple hydraulic fractures can interact with each other and/or with the pre-existing natural fracture network to follow non-planar and complex paths  | 
2015-075 	 a numerical study of the parameters that affect the induced principal stresses by hydraulic fracturing in a shale formation |abstract  a finite difference method (itasca flac2d) has been applied to study a horizontal borehole developed through a shale formation during hydraulic fracturing  the structural impact of differential internal fluid pressures on the borehole periphery has been studied utilizing the numerical method  the research is focused on the effect of critical parameters associated with the hydraulic fracturing on the largest principal stress and differential principal stresses in the rock  according to coulomb’s criterion, failure occurs when the maximum principal stress reaches the ultimate strength of the material for simple tension  based on this theory, the largest principal stress will initiate cracks in the rock and lead to the failure of rock mass  the goal was to observe the effect of borehole radius, internal injection pressure, and k (horizontal stress/vertical stress), on the induced maximum principal stress and differential principal stress  largest principal stress is considered one of the key factors to initiate fractures in the rock  it was observed that increasing internal pressure, borehole radius, and k will significantly increase the induced maximum principal stress and differential principal stresses around the borehole   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a common method that has been used in mining, petroleum and geotechnical engineering for several years  it is a process of initiating and propagating fracture in the subsurface rock by utilizing a pressurized fluid  over the past decade, the extraction of natural gas from shale deposits by using horizontal drilling has improved the economic situation of this technique [1]   horizontal directional drilling is used in some geological settings to produce methane from a variety of shale deposits  in mining, this technology can also enhance the effectiveness of coal degasification procedures and to aid in the delineation of coal reserves  [2]  according to hawkes [2], for petroleum applications, drilling is typically performed from a surface location  in the mining industry; however, it may be feasible to drill from either surface or subsurface locations  the basic principles of directional drilling methods in mining and petroleum applications are essentially the same, involving down-hole drive motors mounted on adjustable, bent bottom hole assemblies | 
2015-080 	 coupling fluid flow and geomechanics in a three-dimensional discrete fracture network simulator |abstract  we developed a three-dimensional discrete fracture network simulator that fully implicitly couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture opening and sliding  the simulator describes flow in both newly forming hydraulic fractures and preexisting natural fractures  the boundary element method is used for the mechanical calculations, which makes it possible to perform the simulations without meshing the volume around the fractures  leakoff is described with a semi-analytical one-dimensional leakoff approximation  to validate the implementation of the boundary element method, we simulated the opening and sliding of a circular crack and compared to analytical solutions  next, we performed simulations of a single propagating hydraulic fracture (with and without leakoff)  the results closely matched analytical solutions for fracture propagation  finally, we performed simulations of injection induced sliding along a fault  in these simulations, injection was performed at constant pressure and leakoff was neglected  the simulations were performed until the fluid pressure in the fault was uniform and equal to the injection pressure  consistent with results from the literature, the simulator predicted that the direction of sliding should deviate slightly from the direction of maximum resolved shear stress, as calculated considering only the remote loading conditions  simulations were performed with the injection point at different locations along the fracture  even though the final stress state was the same in these simulations, the distribution of sliding direction along the fault was modestly different, an indication of the path-dependence of the problem  simulations were performed in which the direction of fracture sliding was handled with explicit, rather than implicit, time stepping  the implicit and explicit methods converged to the same answer if sufficiently small timesteps were used, but with larger timesteps, the implicit method was more accurate    1  introduction  we developed a simulator that fully implicitly couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation (opening and sliding) in three-dimensional discrete fracture networks (dfns)  the code could be used to simulate hydraulic fracturing, induced seismicity, or other processes involving the coupling of fluid flow with fracture deformation | 
2015-082 	 an integrated analytical workflow for analyzing wellbore stress, stability and strengthening |abstract  the aim of this study is to present an integrated and analytical workflow which includes the following execution steps: 1) generating a geomechanical model for the wellbore based on input data from different sources; 2) determining the stress tensor around the wellbore based on a transient thermo-poro-elastic model which include internal/external mud cake effects; 3) determining drilling safe mud weight window based on various failure criteria; 4) identifying troublesome zones with narrow mud weight window throughout the well trajectory; 5) performing an integrated wellbore strengthening analysis based on different mechanisms (e g , induced fracture propagation and plugging, thermal, external and internal mud cake effects); 6) performing an integrated mud loss volume prediction based on different mechanisms (e g , natural fracture loss, induced fracture loss, formation loss); and 7) quantifying the amount of strengthening and re-generating mud weight window for safe drilling  the integrated tool provides a suitable workflow when drilling through depleted zones and for lost circulation   1  introduction  lost circulation is one of the major causes of nonproductive time in drilling operations  if the near wellbore stress state dictates that they should, induced fractures initiate and propagate away from the wellbore and fluid is lost into the formation  this is particularly true for wells being drilled in complex geological settings (such as deep water or highly depleted zones/intervals)  several geomechanical mechanisms (e g , near wellbore fracture propagation, thermo-poroelastic processes, mud cake formation, etc ) can act together to control near wellbore stress field, induced fracture characteristics and associated lost circulation risk  if induced fracture characteristics can be accurately predicted, loss circulation materials can be added to the system to plug fractures of different size(s) and width(s) to increase fracture re-initiation pressure (frip)  this phenomena is also referred as “wellbore strengthening” in the literature   induced fracture characteristics are predominantly controlled by the near wellbore stress field  therefore, one of the prerequisites for a successful design is to establish a workflow (that integrates multiple mechanisms within the framework of a geomechanical engine) to calculate a realistic stress field around the wellbore, to asses induced fracture risk and to come up with an effective wellbore strengthening strategy | 
2015-084 	 coupling of rupture growth and fluid flow along a shear fracture containing structural complexities |abstract  we have used a hydraulic fracture model to quantify fault rupturing promoted by injection and migration of fluid into a fault, which contains in-plane high-conductivity segments and out-of-plane jogs or branches  the fluid under elevated pressure can promote extension-shear fracturing  the model provides numerical results on the opening and pressure variations with position and time  high-conductivity segments aid penetration of the pressurized fluids, but limit fluid pressure increases, so as to sustain a stable rupture growth mode  in the presence of varying normal stresses, stable growth cannot be maintained by pressure variations leading to the unstable growth in shear, and rapid fault movement events can be triggered as the fault re-establishes stable growth, radiating seismic energy and accompanied by local backward slip  these coupled seismic and aseismic faulting processes are applicable to faults with jogs and branches, which interact with the main fault to produce changes in the local stress states  the opening and slip along jogs and branches, either pre-existing or induced by fluid flow, will not only contribute to fluid storage due to their suction pumping action, but also produce changes in the downstream flow rates  the slip along them can produce associated opening along the main fault, but their opening can increase the compressive stress across the main fault which restricts its opening  the deformation transfer at junctions can complicate the fracture and flow responses   1  introduction  injection of liquid waste has been found to result in generation of seismic events and some of these may be large enough to be felt at the surface [1, 2]  the total volume injected and the maximum size of the seismic events generated have been found to be correlated [3]  microseismic monitoring of low-level induced seismicity generated by hydraulic fracturing is a technology applied in unconventional gas reservoirs [4- 6] for the purpose of mapping the extent of fracturing   considerable effort has been devoted to detecting and locating seismic events associated with fluid injection  however, little attention has been paid to understanding the source mechanisms of seismic events for a pressurized fault [7, 8]  hydraulic fracturing in lowpermeability reservoirs is strongly affected by natural fractures within the targeted rock layers  stimulation improves the connection of these fractures to one another and to the hydraulic fracture  slip on these natural fractures can be activated by stress changes to generate low-magnitude seismic events  meanwhile, shearing and shear-induced dilation on the natural fractures enhances conductivity and increases the stimulated volume  the aperture distribution along a fracture, including the initial and subsequent propagation paths, controls the conductivity and pressure distributions resulting from the injection  an integrated coupled hydraulic fracture model is applied in this paper to this problem to predict the relationship among stress, pressure, deformation and rupture growth  | 
2015-087 	 fabric-enriched modeling of anisotropic healing induced by diffusion in granular salt |abstract  this study aims to model anisotropic damage (i e  increase of porosity and loss of stiffness) and healing (i e  recovery of stiffness) in salt rock subject to microcrack initiation, propagation, and rebonding  we introduce enriched fabric tensors in a continuum damage mechanics model to link micro-crack evolution with macroscopic deformation rates  we carry out creep tests on granular salt assemblies to infer the form of fabric descriptors  we use moments of probability of fabric descriptors to find relationships between microstructural and phenomenological variables  creep processes in salt include glide, cross-slip, diffusion, and dynamic recrystallization  we assume that healing is predominantly governed by diffusive mass transfer  we model the corresponding crack cusp propagation on grain faces by means of a two-dimensional diffusion equation  we calibrate this grain-scale healing model against experimental measures of crack cusp propagation distance  we simulate the opening, closure and rebonding of three orthogonal families of micro-cracks during a compression-tension loading cycle  multi-scale model predictions illustrate the evolution of stiffness, deformation, and crack geometry during the anisotropic damage and healing process, and highlight the increased healing efficiency with time  we expect that the proposed modeling approach will provide more precise and reliable performance assessments on geological storage facilities in salt rock   1  introduction  because of its low permeability, water solubility and self-healing properties, salt rock is a favorable host rock for the geological storage of nuclear waste, oil and natural gas, compressed air (caes), and hydrogen  salt properties depend on the state of damage and recovery of the rock, which undergoes temperature and stress cycles around storage facilities  in order to understand and predict the microscopic mechanisms at the origin of damage and healing, we propose to model anisotropic thermo-mechanical damage and healing processes by means of alternative fabric descriptors   thermo-mechanical damage and healing models of salt rock proposed in continuum mechanics rely on the concept of dilatancy boundary [1]  anisotropic healing models based on continuum damage mechanics (cdm) usually resort to the concept of “net damage”, which allows modeling stiffness degradation (damage) and recovery (healing)  these theoretical frameworks are purely hypothetical and do not allow the prediction of all coupled processes that occur in actual rock materials  rock damage models that distinguish closure and rebonding conveniently model all dissipation processes with rate-dependent evolution laws, which avoids implementing threshold-based yield functions in numerical codes  unfortunately, those models do not properly represent the brittle behavior resulting from rate-independent crack opening and closure  in such models, healing is defined as a particular form of crack closure detected by an increment in wave velocity, rather than crack rebonding  | 
2015-089 	 optimum condition of hydraulic fracture-natural fracture interaction in shale block experiments |abstract  natural fractures serve as both reservoir space and flow channel for fluids in shale gas reservoirs  in the process of shale gas reservoir stimulation, the interaction between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures is essential for the generation of fracture network  in this paper, a fracture interaction criterion is derived to predict whether hydraulic fracture would cause shear slippage on natural fracture plane or crossing the natural fracture, and a series of tri-axial tests on natural shale outcrop blocks are conducted to observe the interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures  the study results show that with a certain stress difference and crack occurrence, larger approaching angle, higher pump rate and lower fracturing fluid viscosity would contribute to hydraulic fracture crossing natural fracture and lead to a larger stimulated volume in shale formation  high brittle deformation of shale formation also increases the complexity of fracture network, and the optimal shale target would be high brittleness but low strength and hardness  based on the experiment results, we propose the optimum condition for the interaction between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture, which could be much more practical for the formation evaluation and the better fracture design   1  introduction  natural fractures serve as both the reservoir space and the flow channel of fluids in shale gas reservoirs, which require large-scale hydraulic fracturing to build complex fracture system for gas extracting  for the majority of-shale gas reservoirs, the number of fracture discontinuities is large (gale et al  2007)  however, for some conditions, the fracture may deviate or twist by only a small amount, having a relatively simple propagation path along many pre-existing fractures (zhang and jeffrey 2008; jeffrey et al  2009)  factors affecting the fracture geometry include in-situ stress, rock brittleness and natural fracture system (bedding planes and natural fractures) (king, 2010; britt and schoeffler, 2009; rickman et al, 2008) | 
2015-090 	 prediction of tunnelling-induced settlement using gene expression programming |abstract  the present study aims to apply intelligent method to predict settlement of tunnels  this method can be used for settlement prediction of tunnel future levels  many parameters affect settlement, but some of them are applicable to empirical equations  prediction of this phenomenon depends on many parameters and the effect of each parameter on the other ones has made the use of empirical methods impossible  in this regard, the capability of gene expression programming (gep) method are studied for settlement (st) prediction  the intelligent methods have been studied on the basis of data obtained from 50 tunnels all over the world, which have been excavated using the natm method with similar soil properties  these parameters were collected from previous research data, which the values of settlement were obtained from numerical modeling (flac2dsoftware)  30 datasets were applied for modeling and 20 datasets were used for appraising its performance  the values of stare predicted by using soil strength parameters (e, c and o), depth (z) and diameter (d) of the tunnel  three equations were also rendered by gep method  finally, the results of this method were compared  according to the results, intelligent method are recommended for prediction of the subway settlement   1  introduction  as most railways, roads and especially metro tunnels (below the foundations of surface structures and near major urban facilities) pass through shallow urban areas, their path is not more changeable in order to achieve a reliable ground  the importance of proper analysis, support, construction method and instrumentation is revealed in this case (palmstrom and stille, 2006)  construction of shallow tunnels under the crowded urban areas is faced with obstacles such as settlement  prediction, prevention and protection should be executed in order to control the settlement  methods of prevention and controlling settlement are completely dependent on estimation  in addition, one of the most important factors in selecting the best type of support system is the amount of settlement caused by tunnel excavation  as tunnel settlement estimation depends on several parameters and each parameter could affect the others, application of the empirical or analytical methods could become impossible  to overcome these restrictions, intelligent method techniques can be used to develop a more accurate method   in this paper, an intelligent method widely used in solving complex engineering problems, gene expression programming (gep), has been utilized to propose new model for prediction of tunneling induced settlement  in recent years, intelligent methods have been widely used in field of tunnel engineering (shi et al , 1998; suihui and guorong, 2001; neaupane and adhikari, 2006; suwansawat, 2006; suwansawat and einstein, 2006; santos and tarci_sio, 2008; teskouras et al , 2010)  based on these experiences it could be mentioned that artificial intelligence methods are useful approaches for this purpose | 
2015-096 	 on the use of double differences in inversion of surface movement measurements |abstract  surface movement data can be used in data assimilation or inversion exercises to improve the level of knowledge of a compacting reservoir  we have designed, implemented and tested a new algorithm that uses measured optical height differences directly, without having to translate them to heights with regard to a geodetic reference level  this way, the measurement points are independent of reference benchmarks  in addition, the accumulation of inaccuracy of the height difference measurements, which have to be connected to a stable benchmark over multiple connected benchmark pairs, is circumvented  thus, the new method is less error prone  individual errors in height difference measurements do not propagate into interpreted heights  the procedure was applied to a synthetic case study and compared with the traditional inversion using interpreted height measurements  the reduction in standard deviation between prior and estimated values for the different adjusted parameters was better for the new procedure   1  introduction  the production of gas from subsurface reservoirs in many cases induces ground movement  the pressure reduction results in reservoir compaction, which is transferred to the surface and visible as subsidence  ground movement is traditionally measured with optical levelling technology  well-founded benchmarks are installed, and in repeated measurement campaigns their respective positions are measured  the heights of the benchmarks visited at each campaign are determined by relating them to a single, stable benchmark with a known height with respect to a geodetic reference system like nap (the dutch reference system)  surface movement is then estimated by subtracting heights that have been estimated in measurement campaigns at different times   subsidence estimates are important for the assessment of the damage caused by, for instance, changing relative groundwater levels and related intrusion of salt water in areas close to the sea  they can, however, also be used to improve our understanding of the physics of the subsurface  this is important for improving subsidence predictions resulting from ongoing operations, but also for reservoir management  recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using subsidence estimates for the quantification of aquifer activity and fault sealing properties [1, 2] | 
2015-097 	 integrated 1-d workflow for pore-pressure prediction and mud-weight window calculation for subsalt well sections |abstract  the aim of this work is to present an integrated workflow for the one-dimensional (1-d) analysis of pore-pressure (pp) prediction and mud-weight window (mww) for sub-salt well sections as well as high-angle inclined well sections  in this integrated workflow, empirical information, such as measured data and records of drilling events from offset wells, plays an essential role in the prediction of pp and mww at the target well, along with a set of theoretical equations  the major steps in the workflow include the following: 1) with given data from a set of offset wells and a given location for a target well, prediction analysis of pp and mww are performed with logging data and various measured data from offset wells first  these calculations and calibrations with known data from offset wells generate the values of model parameters for this field, and, thus, the results are empirical  these empirical values of model parameters will be used for subsequent calculations of pp and mww at target well locations  2) the tops-table method, which performs depth-shift calculations is used for extrapolating/interpolating gamma ray and sonic logging data from offset wells to the target well location  3) with logging data generated using the tops-table method and the empirical model data, pp and mww can be obtained at the target well location  a practical case using the workflow introduced here is also presented  this case is from an oil field in deepwater gulf of mexico   1  introduction  pore-pressure (pp) prediction and mud-weight window design (mww) are two of the most popular topics in the area of drilling geomechanics  there are plenty of works on these topics done by various researchers [1][2][3][4][5]   for pore pressure prediction, mouchet and mitchell [1] introduced major methods used in the prediction of pore pressure, such as the eaton method, ratio method, etc  jones, matthews, and standifird [2] introduced their work on pore-pressure prediction with basin modeling  sayers and woodward [3] reported their work on porepressure prediction with focus on techniques for using seismic data for accurate results  for brevity purposes, the general principle of pore pressure prediction via the eaton method is just briefly reviewed | 
2015-098 	 subsidence due to gas production in the wadden sea: how to ensure no harm will be done to nature |abstract  the wadden sea is a shallow tidal sea in the north of the netherlands where gas production is ongoing since 1986  due to the sensitive nature of this area, gas extraction induced subsidence must remain within the “effective subsidence capacity” for the two tidal basins (pinkegat and zoutkamperlaag) affected  we present a probabilistic method to monitor the “effective subsidence capacity” and ensure that subsidence is below the long term (18 6 years) volumetric rate for relative sea level rise that can be accommodated by the tidal basins without environmental harm  the role of sedimentation volume rate, relative sea level rise and subsidence volume rate due to gas depletion are taken into account including their uncertainties  the probability of exceeding the acceptable subsidence limit for the period 2012 to 2050 is 2 8% for the tidal basin called zoutkamperlaag and 1% for the tidal basin of pinkegat for climate scenarios that fit the current relative sea level rise observations on the dutch coast  the values are shown to be dominated by the effect of relative sea level rise, and not due to subsidence induced by gas depletion in the wadden sea  to current knowledge no harm is done to nature   1  introduction  subsidence caused by extraction of hydrocarbons is a sensitive issue in the netherlands due to its proximity to sea level  the wadden sea in the north of the netherlands is a shallow tidal sea behind a chain of coastal barrier islands  it has been inscribed on the unesco’s world heritage list since 2009 because of its unique morphodynamic features and its wildlife  also, it is one of the most notable nature conservation areas in the netherlands protected under the european birds and habitats directives  in the wadden sea, gas production is ongoing since 1986 from the ameland gas field (fig  1)  since 1990 the subsidence caused by depletion of the ameland gas field is compensated by sand suppletions under a dynamic ‘maintain the coast line’ preservation policy [1]  in 2006 additional gas production commenced in the nes, moddergat, lauwersoog and vierhuizen fields (fig  1)  due to the sensitive nature of this tidal sea the gas fields in the area (ameland nes, lauwersoog, vierhuizen, anjum, ezumazijl, mestlawier and moddergat) are being produced within the so-called “effective subsidence capacity” [2] | 
2015-102 	 proppant and host rock deformation in fractured shale flow through experiments |abstract  a series of tests were performed on a manually fractured (subparallel to bedding) and propped (using quartz sand) shale plug to determine the extent to which the proppant fractured and the effect the proppant had on the fracture wall when subjected to reservoir conditions  the specimen was repeatedly subjected to reservoir conditions of 20 7 mpa confining pressure, 6 9 mpa differential stress and a temperature of 75°c  while at reservoir conditions the sample permeability was measured  periodically the specimen was removed from the test system and scanned with a x-ray micro computed tomography machine to visualize the fracture and proppant  noticeable decrease in flow was observed with subsequent testing due to fracture closure  this can be attributed to observations of clay swelling, proppant embedment/fracture, and shale wall spalling leading to a decrease in effective fracture aperture  flow induced particle transport clogged flow paths and impeded flow  it was observed that isolated grains tended to crush whereas continuous grain patches tended to fracture with little displacement and tended towards embedment   1  introduction  in recent years the united states has become the largest producer of both petroleum and natural gas  this is a direct result of source rock exploitation through drilling and hydraulically fracturing long horizontal bore holes  while there is no dispute that this process has been effective and profitable there is still much that is not well understood about the life of proppants and fracture connectivity downhole  production declines from these sources are higher than conventional wisdom predicts  therefore, it is important to better understand the fracture and proppant placement process so that it can be tailored to help maximize production while minimizing environmental impact | 
2015-103 	 development of a transient 3d multilayered geomechanic hydraulic fracture model to evaluate the temporary localized change in stress anisotropy |abstract  traditional modeling approaches for hydraulic stimulation treatments typically make the assumption that the formation can be modeled as a linear elastic material under static equilibrium  as such, all information regarding the transient response of the formation is neglected  however, during a hydraulic stimulation treatment, transient geomechanics forces are exerted on the formation, which modify the stress landscape near the wellbore and fracture planes  in regions where the horizontal stress anisotropy is less than 25%, the potential for a temporary reversal in the minimum stress direction exists  during this brief time window, a secondary hydraulic fracture can be created in a completely different direction, thus providing direct connectivity to previously unattainable locations in the formation  this paper presents a computational validation of this process using a unique transient 3d computational geomechanic fracture simulation  this new stimulation method enhances current standards in hydraulic fracturing by requiring an understanding of the transient geomechanic response in the treatment area    1  introduction  during a hydraulic stimulation treatment, geomechanic forces are exerted on the formation, which temporarily modify the stress landscape near the wellbore [1, 2]  this phenomenon is often referred to as stress shadowing, and is traditionally considered a negative byproduct of hydraulic fracturing treatments  the increased compressive stress caused by the first fracture acts to naturally divert subsequent fractures, and can significantly limit the fracture growth [3]  under certain circumstances, the stress shadowing can create a full reversal of the local minimum and maximum stress directions (fig  1), causing the next fracture to propagate perpendicular to the original in-situ maximum stress direction [4]  several modeling efforts, similar to those conducted by morrill and miskimins [4], have been undertaken to better understand the sensitivity of various formation and treatment parameters on the size of the stress shadowed region  the goal of these studies was to predict the extent of the effected zone for prescribing optimal fracture spacing along the lateral section of a horizontal well to prevent fracture interference  | 
2015-106 	 exploring conceptual models of hydraulic fracture network growth |abstract  numerical simulations were used to study three methods for modeling hydraulic fracturing in low permeability formations: simple geometry (sg), mixed-mechanism stimulation (mms), and primary fracturing with shear stimulation leakoff (pfssl)  simulations with sg have a small number of hydraulic fractures and do not explicitly represent natural fractures  the pfssl conceptual model assumes one or a few large hydraulic fractures at each stage, with fluid leakoff into explicitly represented natural fractures  the mms conceptual model involves a larger number of hydraulic fractures and includes the effect of hydraulic fracture termination against natural fractures and other planes of weakness  the simulations in our study were performed using a discrete fracture network simulator that efficiently couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation  our investigation focused on conceptual model of stimulation affects parameters observed at the field scale: fracture network length, the impact of induced stresses, stimulation heterogeneity, and trends in initial shut-in pressure (isip) along the well  compared to models with sg, it was found that pfssl or mms models yielded results more consistent with common observations from field data  the sg simulations exaggerated the effect of induced stresses, lacked the variability and heterogeneity commonly observed in field data, predicted very low net pressure, and had excessively long fractures unless relatively high matrix permeability was assumed    1  introduction  conventional hydraulic fracturing models assume simple fracture geometry, such as a single planar fracture per stage [1]  however, a variety of observations suggest that fracturing creates complex geometries [2-7], especially in unconventional resources [8, 9, 10]   a variety of numerical and analytical tools are being used to describe hydraulic fracturing in unconventional formations  most assume that one or a few large planar fractures form per stage  some of these models use discrete fracture networks to explicitly model the leakoff of fluid from the primary fracture(s) into surrounding natural fractures, which experience stimulation in response to the increase in fluid pressure [11, 12]  we refer to this type of model as "primary fracturing with shear stimulation leakoff" (pfssl)  other approaches use one or a few hydraulic fractures per stage and do not explicitly represent the stimulated natural fractures [13-17]  we refer to these "simple geometry" (sg) models  a third class of model incorporates the effect of hydraulic fracture termination against natural fractures  in these models, large, continuous hydraulic fractures are unable to propagate through the formation because they sometimes truncate against natural fractures or other planes of weakness  instead of forming one or a few dominant hydraulic fractures, stimulation creates a more distributed and branching network that includes both new and preexisting fractures [18-22]  we refer to these models as "mixed-mechanism stimulation "| 
2015-108 	 stress changes associated with the evolution of a salt diapir into a salt sheet |abstract  we study how stresses change as a salt diapir evolves into a salt sheet with no concurrent sedimentation  we find a reversal in the stress direction, as the radial stress changes from being the maximum stress when the diapir is rising, to minimum when the salt sheet is advancing  we study an axisymmetric diapir with the large-strain fe program elfen  we model the salt as solid visco-plastic, and the sediments as poro-elastoplastic materials  during the diapir rise, the salt applies a horizontal thrust load onto the upper parts of the basin  however, as the diapir evolves into a sheet, the effective height of the salt diapir drops, and so the stress within the salt decreases  at the same time, the vertical stress within the basin increases because of the weight of the advancing sheet  we hence predict a change in the orientation of the minimum principal stress within the wall rocks associated with a switch from horizontal shortening to extension  furthermore, the ratio of minimum effective principal stress to effective overburden decreases after the salt emplacement, and shear stresses below the salt sheet change  overall, our results highlight that forward evolutionary modeling can improve borehole stability calculations below salt   1  introduction  a salt sheet is an allochthonous salt body sourced from a single feeder, whose breadth is several times greater than its maximum thickness [1]  the most common type spreads laterally from the top of a feeder diapir, and forms when the upward rise of the salt in the feeder is much faster than the local sedimentation rate [2]  salt sheets are a common feature in salt systems around the world, including a very strong presence in the gulf of mexico [1]  prediction of stresses and pore pressure below salt sheets is increasingly important for the exploration stage of drilling programs  new plays have been discovered beneath allochthonous salt [3-6]  however, there are several documented examples of drilling problems in such locations that have led to additional expense or even abandonment [3-5, 7, 8]  improving the prediction of the stress state below salt sheets will benefit the design of the most economic well trajectory, best casing plan and overall borehole stability | 
2015-110 	 numerical study of tensile thermal stresses in a casing-cement-rock system with heterogeneities |abstract  the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of thermal conductivities and young's moduli of damaged materials (high-porosity material with the lowest absorption of x-rays in computed tomography images) on tensile stresses and tensile damage evolution during heating and cooling of a downscaled casing-cement-rock assembly  tensile failure was predicted during thermal cycling of the casing-cement-rock assembly at both heating and cooling stages  the failure occurred predominantly in damaged cement and damaged rock  the simulation results suggested that cement immediately adjacent to the casing pipe is most prone to tensile cracking during both heating and cooling  reducing stiffness of damaged materials reduced the overall number of tensile cracks, and introduced a small amount of cracks in the intact cement  reducing thermal conductivity of damaged materials increased the overall number of tensile cracks, and introduced a small amount of cracks in the intact rock and a significant number of tensile cracks in intact cement  the results indicate that tensile cracks may be generated even in the intact cement during heating, if there is sufficient contrast in thermal conductivity between damaged and undamaged materials   1  introduction  injection of relatively cold or hot fluids into cased wells is not uncommon in oil and gas industry  injection of hot fluids takes place e g  under huff-and-puff stimulation and during steam-assisted gravity drainage  cooling of a cased well can occur during injection of co2 into underground reservoirs for permanent storage  heating or cooling may have an adverse effect on well integrity  in particular, tensile thermal stresses can be induced in cement around casing  cement is a brittle material  its tensile strength is typically much lower than its compressive strength  tensile thermal stresses can therefore produce cracks in bulk cement or at an interface between cement and casing or rock  such interfacial cracks, once joined together, can make up a conductive fracture network and act as a conduit along the well  this can enable fluid flow between geological strata and thereby violate zonal isolation principles  this will call for remedial measures which can be expensive  therefore, being able to predict mechanical stability around wells subject to heating, cooling or thermal cycling is crucial for safe and environmentally-conscious operation of wells | 
2015-111 	 discrete element modeling and analysis of shielding effects during the crushing of a grain |abstract  the potential for a particle to crush under one-dimensional compression is critically dependent on the coordination number of that particle  neighboring particles decrease deviatoric forces at contacts, which reduces tensile stress and subsequent fracture propagation in the crushable particle  this phenomenon is called “shielding effect”  in this paper, we model a sand particle as a spherical cluster of bonded, hexagonally packed, equally sized, non-breakable spheres with the discrete element method (dem)  we use rigid walls to apply forces at the contact with neighboring particles  first, we calibrate the cluster mechanical parameters against published experimental results obtained during unconfined uniaxial compression tests  then we propose a procedure employed in dem to generate symmetric and random distributions of walls  we use two loading walls only: the remainder of the walls is used for passive shielding  force-displacement curves obtained during the crushing simulations clearly show that the peak force reached when the cluster first splits increases with the number of shielding walls, which demonstrates shielding effects  the total resulting compression force applied by the walls increases linearly the coordination number  we expect that our computational method will allow the optimization of crushing in powder technology, and the prevention of crushing in geotechnical engineering   1  introduction  mechanical particle crushing is used in civil engineering, powder technology and mineral industry  the most elementary crushing event is the crushing of a single particle subjected to highly compressive stresses  single particle compression tests, in which an individual sand grain or rock stone is vertically compressed between two horizontal platens, are often used to study crushing at the particle-scale [1-3]  crushing depends on particle size, shape and coordination number [4-6] | 
2015-112 	 application of analytical probabilistic method to estimate minimum horizontal in situ stress from a leak-off test (lot) acquired in a high inclined well in a deepwater turbidites oil field, offshore b… |abstract  the aim of this study is to present an analytical probabilistic approach using monte carlo simulation method to estimate the minimum horizontal in situ stress magnitude from a single leak-off test (lot) acquired in highly deviated well in a sand interval inside the reservoir section, accounting for the uncertainties in some of the key input variables such as maximum horizontal in situ stress magnitude, and rock mechanic properties (young modulus, and poisson’s ratio)  the major assumption used is that the leak-off test (lot) acquired was a representation of the fracture initiation pressure in the sand interval  a field case in a deep water turbidites oil field located offshore brasil is presented to illustrate the application of this approach  the result of this study provides a full probabilistic density function (pdf) for the estimated minimum horizontal in situ stress magnitude  the result also indicated that the minimum horizontal in situ stress contrast between the reservoir and the overlying cap rock is relative small in any cases as expected in shallow and unconsolidated sediment environment   1  introduction  estimation of the minimum horizontal in situ stresses in the reservoir and cap rock is critical in onshore and offshore waterflood projects either if they will be executed at fracture or matrix conditions  intentionally or unintentionally induced hydraulic fracture can breach the cap rock, eventually leading undesired fluids to the surface creating considerable environmental problems  as a result, interest in determination of minimum horizontal in situ stress has increased in recent years  thus, it is extremely important to ensure that the injection can be maintained in a safe and effective manner    the minimum horizontal in situ stress can be determined by direct measurement via hydraulic fracturing, mini-fracs [1], and extended leakoff test (xlot) [2]  however, it is quite often that only a limited leak-off test (lot) is acquired during drilling operation, and used as a measure of the fracture initiation pressure (pw), i e , not a valid measure of the minimum horizontal in situ stress  the present work is aimed to use a probabilistic approach to estimate this in situ stress magnitude, hence, providing a critical input into the operational envelope for the water injection in the field under study | 
2015-118 	 wellbore stress changes and microannulus development because of cement shrinkage |abstract  this paper aims to quantitatively explore effects of effective radial stress change (<u+0394><ed><u+00a0><u+00b5><ed><u+00bc><u+008f>'<ed><u+00a0><u+00b5><ed><u+00b1><u+009f>) around a wellbore because of cement shrinkage in a 2d elastic isothermal state  as cement shrinks, the formation moves inward and the radial stresses diminish  this induced change can be problematic if the total radial stress falls below the formation pore pressure in the outside-the-casing environment (the hydraulic fracture condition)  if this occurs (<ed><u+00a0><u+00b5><ed><u+00bc><u+008f><ed><u+00a0><u+00b5><ed><u+00b1><u+009f> < po), fluid migration risk is massively enhanced because a connected vertical microannulus (fracture) is a pathway for buoyant upward gas movement  to model stress change, we use simple kirsch equations and a computer code based on a radial shrinkage percentage in the cement to calculate the new effective radial stress  similarly, using abaqus software, the possibility of surface detaching between the formation and cement bond has been modeled  numerical results show that, based on the geomechanical properties of a formation and the cement shrinkage percentage value in the cement sheath, upward movement of fluid is possible, even likely in many circumstances    1  introduction  gas migration (gm), gas invasion, or gas seepage (in a more general form “fluid” migration) has been an oil and gas industry issue for decades  this problem is important for the oil and gas industry because in cases of formation fluid migration, the integrity of a wellbore will not be sustained completely and can lead to environmental issues [1]  even if the environmental impacts are minimal, leakage events have a large social impact, and this aspect of the risk involved must be properly managed    the term gas migration is commonly used, but a better understanding of the seepage mechanisms is essential  during a wellbore’s life, from well construction (drilling and completion) to decommissioning (well abandonment) and thereafter, the possibility of migration remains present  not surprisingly, many researchers have tried to identify and explain the mechanisms [2, 3] from their perspectives, but a general scientifically supported consensus still seems unachieved | 
2015-119 	 fully 3d hydraulic fracturing model: optimizing sequence fracture stimulation in horizontal wells |abstract  hydraulic fracturing is a reservoir stimulation technique which in unconventional (e g , shale gas or oil) plays is required to generate sufficient reservoir contact to enhance production  frac design approaches use fracture spacing, sequence, and other parameters to enhance fracture complexity through modification of the local stresses within the stimulated area  conventional frac designs consist of a series of stages within a well stimulated sequentially, from toe to heel  a newer promising design is a zipper frac, where two or more parallel horizontal wells are stimulated stage by stage alternating between wells in a “zipper” pattern  the effectiveness of zipper fracs has been demonstrated by industry; however, the treatment optimization is still under development  in this paper a fully 3-d reservoir model is used to capture some of the fundamental effects which influence fracture growth during stimulation using three different stimulation approaches, for two different well spacings  the three designs are investigated are: conventional, in which all stages in sequence are stimulated first in well 1, followed by well 2 and then well 3; zipper frac, in which stage 1 is stimulated in wells 1, 2, and 3 and then stage 2 is stimulated in each of the wells, repeating until all stages are stimulated; and modified zipper frac, in which stage 1 is stimulated in well 1, then in well 3, then in well 2, and the same sequence is repeated  following each stage the fractures are numerically propped so that their residual aperture is 50% of the total aperture, eliminating any surfaces with apertures smaller than 0 0025 meters as too small to receive proppant  in this way we can compare the relative fracture surface area which remains productive among the different approaches  the results reveal subtle but significant changes in the stress state due to the different stagings both as a function of time during the stimulation (which will affect subsequent propped aperture) as well as after the entire sequence is pumped  the greatest area is achieved for the modified zipper sequence; the improvement is larger for the closer spacing of the wells  these changes in turn result in differences in total propped area which will lead to differences in ip  one interesting consequence of the analysis is that although the initial propped area is larger if wells are farther apart, the ratio of propped area to total area available to be drained is smaller suggesting that the initially higher ip for the larger well spacing is achieved at the cost that ultimate recovery for the field is likely to be lower   1  introduction  one of the primary goals of hydraulic fracturing is to maximize the effective fracture surface area that connects the reservoir volume to the wells  the operational parameters that can be relatively easily manipulated include fracturing fluid properties, injection rate, proppant quantity and schedule, and the spacing and stimulation sequence of stages in a multi-well multistage system (pad)  recent studies (roussel et al , 2011; rafiee et al , 2012; rios et al , 2013,) have suggested that it is possible to achieve greater “complexity” of the resulting fracture network through appropriate engineering of the staging and cross-well stimulation sequences  there is no clear definition on which the above papers agree for the term “complexity,” nor is it clear how they treat each fracture after injection into that fracture is complete  rather than address this issue here, we focus in this paper on the differences among the different effective surface areas of the primary fractures  and, we clearly define the behavior of each fracture after it has been pumped and propped | 
2015-120 	 modeling fluid-driven fractures using the generalized finite element method (gfem) |abstract  hydraulic fracturing is a widely used technique in oil and gas production to increase the permeability of near-well reservoir and enhance hydrocarbon recovery  modeling hydraulic fracturing involves solving coupled multi-physics equations in a robust numerical solution scheme  we present a generalized finite element framework to simulate the propagation of fluid-driven fractures in a linear elastic medium  the fluid flow within the fracture is described by the reynolds lubrication equation, where the classical cubic law links the fluid pressure gradient and the flow rate in the fracture plane  the gfem framework allows fractures to propagate inside the cells, and thus finite element discretization can be non-conforming with fracture geometry  the fluid front is tracked to permit fluid lag during the simulations  a unified traction-separation law is proposed to model the mechanical behavior of the fracture faces, including contact, cohesion and interface strength softening  the traction-separation law on the fracture faces is enforced by a penalty method  the coupled nonlinear system is solved by a standard newton-raphson method  several 3d numerical studies and benchmarking examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework in modeling fluid-driven fracture propagation   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a technique widely used in the oil and gas industry to enhance hydrocarbon recovery from underground reservoirs  the process often results in the initiation and growth of tensile fractures, typically driven by viscous fluid that is injected into the rock with relatively high flow rate and high pressure  after the fracture is generated, certain sand-like propping agents (also called ’proppants’) are introduced into the newlyformed fracture to prevent full closure after the fluid pressure is released  studies on hydraulic fracturing can also be found in other geomechanical applications such as geothermal energy recovery [1], transportation of magma through earth’s crust [2], sequestration of co2 [3], embankment dam failures [4], and induced caving in mining [5] | 
2015-121 	 investigation of shear-induced permeability in unconventional reservoirs |abstract  the interaction of hydraulic fractures with the pre-existing natural fractures may play a major role in increasing productivity from unconventional formations  when a hydraulic fracture meets a natural fracture, the hydraulic fracture can cross the natural fracture or be arrested  if the natural fracture is permeable, fracturing fluid can leak from the hydraulic fracture into the natural fracture causing elevation of pore pressure in the natural fracture and reducing the effective normal stress acting on the natural fracture, which could then lead to shear failure or slippage along the natural fracture plane  shear-slip causes dilation, potentially increasing fracture conductivity and enhancing fluid flow deeper into the natural fracture  the conductivity of unpropped shear-induced fractures can play an important role in enhancing the productivity from ultralow-permeability formations like shale  in this paper, we first evaluate analytically the shear-slip condition and its propagation along a natural fracture under remote normal and shear stresses, when it is exposed to the fluid pressure in a hydraulic fracture  analytical approximations under some limiting conditions are considered  a rigorous 2d numerical model based on coupling between fluid flow and rock deformation using displacement discontinuity method and fluid flow in the fracture is then described  the results of numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effect of rock stress anisotropy, initial natural fracture conductivity, and fluid properties on the evolution of the fluid and slip fronts along the natural fracture and the associated permeability enhancement   1  introduction  in the last decade, following the success of horizontal drilling and multistage fracturing in the barnett shale, exploration and drilling activities in shale gas and shale oil reservoirs have skyrocketed in the us and abroad  economic production from these reservoirs depends greatly on the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing stimulation treatment  microseismic measurements and other evidence suggest that creation of complex fracture networks during fracturing treatments may be a common occurrence in many unconventional reservoirs [1-3]  the created complexity is strongly influenced by the preexisting natural fractures and in-situ stresses in the formation  to optimize the fracture and completion design to maximize the production from these reservoirs, engineers must have a good understanding of the fracturing process and be able to simulate it to obtain information such as the induced overall fracture length and height, propped versus unpropped fracture surface areas, proppant distribution and its conductivity, and potential enhanced permeability through stimulation of the natural fractures | 
2015-123 	 numerical manifold modeling of coupled hydro-mechanical processes in fractured porous rock masses |abstract  in this study, we developed a new numerical manifold method model for the analysis of coupled hydro-mechanical processes in fractured, porous rock  the fractures are considered as porous media with nonlinear behavior of hydraulic and mechanical properties involving both direct (poro-elastic) and indirect (property-change) couplings  based on an energy-work model, we stringently established all components of the work related to fluid flow and mechanical processes in porous media in a unified form and their direct coupling  for indirect coupling, we derived a new formulation that implicitly considers the nonlinear fracture properties and deformation by directly assembling the corresponding strain energy  compared with traditional methods with approximation of the nonlinear constitutive equations, this new formulation achieves more accurate representation of the nonlinear fracture deformation behavior  with the new model, we developed a new computer code in our numerical manifold method package  we tested the code with very dense mesh for direct coupling on (1) a classical poroelastic column and (2) a semiinfinite media under strip load, respectively and compared the results with the analytical solutions, achieving very good agreement  finally, we tested for direct and indirect coupling on a model with a single dominant fracture and obtained sensible results   1  introduction  hydro-mechanical (hm) coupling refers to the interaction between hydraulic and mechanical processes that may be triggered by mechanical loading/unloading or fluid injection/extraction  this interaction is significant in geological engineering, such as oil and gas extraction, geothermal energy, nuclear waste disposal, where the geological media usually consist of fractured rock [1]  these fractured rock masses may contain fractures with complex geometry and fillings, thus could be modeled as a fractured porous media  basically, the mechanisms of hm coupling in fractured porous media are: (1) direct coupling, i e  the poro-elastic instantaneous undrained coupling between mechanical and hydraulic fields  specifically, the fluid pressure affects deformation while the volume change affects the pressure distribution  (2) indirect coupling, i e  interaction between mechanical and hydraulic fields indirectly, through their properties  specifically, the effective stress change, affected by fluid pressure change, would change the stiffness of fractures, while the deformation of fractures change their hydraulic conductivities [1- 2]  | 
2015-125 	 analysis of stimulated volume resulting from fluid injection into a fracture rock mass |abstract  natural and hydraulic fractures in shale reservoirs are essential for providing transport conduit for the movement of fluids during fluid injection and extraction  variations of flow conditions in the reservoir induce tractions on the fractures that potentially cause a joint to slip or micro-earthquake (meq) when the shear stress exceeds a critical value based on a failure criterion  proper identification of subsurface events in a large-scale situation is of great interest for the geothermal and petroleum industries to monitor potential modification of fracture permeability during production operations as well as hydraulic fracture propagation in stimulation treatments  the displacement discontinuity method (ddm) is commonly used for modeling the behavior of fractures in linear-elastic rocks  however, ddm requires the calculation of the influences among all fractures, so it is not computational efficient for large fracture systems  this work involves using the fast multipole method (fmm) with ddm to simulate large-scale naturally fractured reservoirs subjected to production and injection  synthetic case studies containing up to ten thousand fracture elements in reservoirs with and without sealing faults are carried out and the microseismic responses analyzed  the results show the approach to be effective and efficient  in addition, the results do illustrate the role of the fluid pressure on the fracture failure mechanism in large-scale situations  potential shear slips associated with stimulated zones in the reservoir are most likely to occur near the injector wells where the pressure is higher  finally, fractured reservoirs with faults experienced more events due to the compartmentalization that causes zones of higher pressure to develop   1  introduction  natural and hydraulic fractures in shale reservoirs are essential for providing transport conduit for the movement of fluids during fluid injection and extraction  variations of flow conditions in the reservoir induce tractions on the fractures that potentially cause a joint to slip or microearthquakes (meq) when the shear stress exceeds a critical value based on a failure criterion  the mohr-coulomb failure criterion is widely used in egs to predict shear slippage of fractures  identification of subsurface events in large-scale situations is of great interest for the geothermal and petroleum industries to monitor potential modification of fracture permeability during production operations as well as hydraulic fracture propagation in stimulation treatments  the displacement discontinuity method (ddm) is commonly used for modeling the behavior of fractures  however, ddm requires the calculation of the influences among all fractures, so it is not computational efficient for large fracture systems  fast summation techniques such as the fast multipole method (fmm) have improved the performance of some boundary-value problems in terms of memory requirements and cpu time [1]  recent applications combining fmm and ddm (fmdmm) have been successfully applied to accelerate the computation of reservoir geomechanical interactions of large-scale fracture networks [2, 3]  | 
2015-126 	 effect of fracture breakdown pressure on multicluster hydraulic fracturing treatments |abstract  the success of unconventional reservoir development relies on the technology of multistage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells  in each stage, multiple perforation clusters are often used to create multiple fractures to provide adequate drainage along the entire horizontal well and, at the same time, to achieve economic goals  however, the production contribution from each perforation cluster has been found to be highly uneven  one of the reasons for low cluster efficiency is that effective fractures are not created from all the perforation clusters  field observations have shown that the magnitude of fracture breakdown pressure can vary significantly along a horizontal wellbore  both the magnitude and the variation of fracture breakdown pressure can cause ineffective fractures and low cluster efficiency  a computer hydraulic fracture simulator was used to study the breakdown of multiple fractures from a horizontal well  the measured breakdown pressures from actual fracturing treatments in a horizontal well are used in the simulation  the simulation results show that only a limited number of fractures can be generated for a given pump rate, independent of the number of the clusters available in a stage  the number of fractured clusters depends on the magnitude and variation of fracture breakdown pressure  the simulator has also been used to show cluster efficiency can be improved by perforation designs, as well as by advanced diversion techniques   1  introduction  the success of unconventional reservoir development relies on the technology of multistage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells  in each stage, multiple perforation clusters are often used to create multiple fractures to provide adequate drainage along the entire horizontal wellbore  however, the production contribution from each perforation cluster has been found to be highly uneven, with 40% of the perforation clusters contributing little to no production [1, 2]  in recent years, engineered staging completions based on rock properties and log data along the horizontal wellbore have been used to improve the cluster efficiency with some degree of success [3, 4] | 
2015-127 	 geomechanical evaluation of fault reactivation potential and uplift at the south west hub geological co2 storage site, western australia |abstract  an area in the southern perth basin has been identified as a potentially suitable site for co2injection, due to its proximity to major co2emission sources and the presence of potentially suitable geology  the project for testing and proving up of the storage area is known as the south west hub project or sw hub  recently acquired 2d seismic and well data have allowed a detailed description of facies, measurement of rock properties and development of a 3d structural model for the area  this 3d model has been used as the basis for a preliminary fault seal analysis and also for the development of simplified geomechanical models for the sw hub using flac3d  the geomechanical modelling used in situ stress (magnitude, orientation) and pore pressure conditions as a starting point and then simulated co2injection from a single well at rates of 1 to 5 million tons per year for 20 years  no matter whether weak or strong faults were used, no faults were reactivated nor the top seal breached under any of the simulated injection rates  average uplift in the weak fault scenario was modelled at between 0 4 and 1 8 cm for injection rates of 1 to 5 million tons per year  the strong fault model showed slightly smaller uplifts  the majority of uplift was noted in the first 5 years of injection and flattened off rapidly after this point in time  this is consistent with geomechanical models from other co2storage sites and from actual field measurements   1  introduction  suitable geology and proximity to large sources of carbon dioxide led to the southern perth basin being investigated as a potential geological storage site [1]  the specific area selected is in the region of the harvey- 1 well (figure 1) around 150 km south of perth in western australia  this has become known as the south west hub project and this area is currently undergoing extensive site assessment in terms of reservoir quality, containment potential, structural geology, facies analysis, rock properties and the like | 
2015-131 	 long-term stability analysis for high arch dam based on time-dependent deformation reinforcement theory |abstract  the project of high arch dam has an intense disturbance to its geological environment with high in-situ stress in the critical instability state, and the creep and damage of foundation rock mass resulting from the process of non-equilibrium evolution has an adverse impact on long-term safety of arch dam  time-dependent deformation reinforcement theory (tdrt) has been presented for evaluating the long-term stability of arch dam  based on duvaut-lions visco-plastic model and lyapunov asymptotic stability analysis, the principle of minimum plastic complementary energy is proved for perfect and hardening yielding, in which viscoplastic structures deform tending to the limit steady state at which the pce is minimized under time invariant loading and boundary conditions  so the pce is a reasonable and quantitative criterion for stability evolution and unbalanced forces can be used to determine the reinforcement since they have a complete mathematical basis  the expression of pce and unbalanced forces for finite element method have been finished base on drucker-prager yield criteria  this theory is implemented in tfine, which is a parallel fem code with gpu acceleration, and then used in the long-term safety evaluation of jinping arch dam in china   1  introduction  in china, most of high arch dams are located in the southwest, such as jinping i hydropower station with the maximum height of 305 m, xiaowan arch dam (294 5 m), xiluodu arch dam (285 5 m), etc  due to the intensively geological uplifting of the qinghai-tibet plateau, this region has steep valley and complicated geological environment with high in-situ stress in the critical instability state  the engineering experiences and catastrophes of arch dams around the world have shown that the stability of dam foundation is the key point of the overall stability of the dam [1], so the special geological conditions of the southwest china result in a prominent problem of the stability of high arch dam | 
2015-132 	 an experimental study on interaction between hydraulic fractures and partially-cemented natural fractures |abstract  this paper presents laboratory experiments designed to explore the interaction between hydraulic fractures and preexisting natural fractures that are strongly cemented but over only a portion of the natural fracture  the results show that a hydraulic fracture penetrates directly through a fully and strongly cemented pre-existing natural fracture  we then vary the proportion of the natural fracture that is strongly cemented  in most of these partially-cemented cases, the hydraulic fracture is observed to persist through the entire height of the specimen both before and after the interface  however, the fracture path persists directly through strongly-cemented portions while there are offsets at uncemented portions  a fully debonded result is obtained when the cemented region is 5 mm in height, that is, 10% the height of the interface and about 13% of the hydraulic fracture halflength at the time of intersection  the initial results of this seldom-considered but almost certainly realistic configuration of partial bonding suggest that hydraulic fracture path is strongly influenced by the size of the bonded region of the natural fracture, and, perhaps more importantly, that strong bonding over only a portion of the natural fracture can be sufficient to promote hydraulic fracture crossing  four patterns are observed for the interaction between the hydraulic fracture and the strongly cemented natural fracture: (1) complete crossing, (2) crossing and offset, (3) crossing, partial debonding and offset, (4) complete debonding   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a widely used well-stimulation technique for enhancing the productivity of oil and natural gas in unconventional reservoirs  the interaction between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing natural fractures in a reservoir can strongly influence the fracture network geometries and is widely recognized as one of the main issues for understanding hydraulic fracture propagation in unconventional, and some conventional, reservoirs  the mechanics of the interaction of hydraulic fractures with natural fractures is often understood through some now-classical analytical solutions and mechanical models [1-4]  work on this subject is ongoing, with recent contributions aimed at experimental evaluation of these criteria and/or development of more generalized approaches [5]  extensive numerical and experimental studies have also been conducted to interpret and predict the mode of interaction [6-10] | 
2015-134 	 what can we learn from ultrasonic velocities monitoring during hydraulic fracturing of a tight shale |abstract  methods allowing to estimate the size and aperture of induced hydraulic fracture are essential for a proper design of unconventional reservoir well stimulation  in this paper, we focus on ultrasonic velocities monitoring during hydraulic fracturing of a tight shale  we report experimental results, where a sample was first loaded in a polyaxial loading frame and then fractured by injection of a viscous fluid at a constant flow  during the experiment, p-wave velocities were periodically measured in different directions  our results show that ultrasonic measurements can be useful for understanding the mechanics of the hydraulic fracture growth  more precisely, from the evolution of the p-velocities and their amplitudes during the loading, we are able: (i) to estimate the velocity of the hydraulic fracture growth; (ii) to show that propagation of a liquid-free crack always precedes the liquid front; (iii) to estimate the aperture of the hydraulic fracture   these results show that ultrasonic velocities monitoring can yield direct measurements of fracture width, length and dynamics of propagation  these inferred properties of the hydraulic fracture can also provide verification of the results of various theoretical models describing fracture propagation   1  introduction  detailed characterization of rock fracturing induced by fluid injection is very important task for oil and gas industry, where hydraulic fracturing is crucial to enhance hydrocarbon production, as well for microseismic monitoring of intrusive dykes in the earth crust  the conditions under which fluid-driven fracture propagates within rocks are usually not well defined  several fracture-propagation theories have been developed  pioneer contributions have been made by barenblatt [1], and more recently by detournay et al  [2-4]  however, there is a certain lack of direct field measurements of the hydraulic fracture dimensions, verifying results of these models | 
2015-135 	 proppant transport and settling in a narrow vertical wedge-shaped fracture  |abstract  an appropriate propped fracture is important for oil and gas production (especially in shale formations)  the actual proppant placement during fracturing is generally unknown  any fair prediction of the placement of the proppant may results in significant improvements for the fracture protocol design  we present experimental data on the transport and settling of particles dragged by water through a narrow wedge-shaped vertical fracture  we discuss some basic features of the dynamics of the settlement of the proppant dune and show results on the final placement for different pumping rates and particle sizes  results are consistent with previous findings by others and confirm that some usual practices in the field are beneficial to maximize the propped volume and minimize arching   1  introduction  in recent years, many oil companies have directed their efforts towards developing unconventional reservoirs  the challenges encountered to guarantee a profitable operation in these plays lead the industry to devote significant amounts resources to optimize processes such as hydraulic fracturing, a vital stimulation technique   hydraulic fracturing consist in the injection of fluids, along with proppants, into the formation aimed at creating and/or enhancing existing fractures to open high conductivity channels connecting the formation and the wellbore [1]   proppants are granular materials that fill the fracture and support the closing pressure, keeping the fracture conductive during production  although fracturing techniques have evolved, there is still opportunities to increase efficiency  many of these opportunities are related with the way in which proppants are transported and deposited into the fracture | 
2015-137 	 a new 3d constitutive model for rock mass tunnel |abstract  a new constitutive model is proposed based on the generalized three-dimensional (3d) hoek-brown strength criterion, which was proposed by zhang and zhu [1, 2]  the constitutive model involves a 3d multi-segment plasticity flow rule that can not only consider the effect of the different confining stresses on the plasticity flow rule and volumetric deformation but also need no addition uncertain parameter such as dilatancy angle  the constant volume flow rule is applied at the high confining stress condition  with the specific mathematical treatment and derivation, a new interpolation and radial flow rule is prescribed at the low confining stress and the tension condition respectively, and the continuity of plastic potential function at the principal stress space is ensured  then the new constitutive model is implemented in the three-dimensional finite element software (geofba3d)  a set of numerical true triaxial compressive tests are carried out and compared with analytical solutions  finally, a real engineering example of a highway tunnel excavated in rock masses is given for validation and application    1  introduction  in order to determination the strength of the rock and rock masses in rock mechanics and rock masses engineering, the hoek–brown strength criterion was developed for intact rock originally [3, 4] and then extended to rock masses[5, 6]  hoek and brown derived their strength criterion for intact rock with one of pure trial and error, and for rock masses with considering the geological condition from the field  the hoek–brown criterion has been used most widely in rock engineering that was due to the adequacy of its predictions of the observed rock fracture behavior, and the convenience of its application to a range of typical engineering problems  however, a major limitation for the hoek–brown strength criterion was that it cannot consider the effect of the intermediate principal stress  to overcome the limitation, several three-dimensional (3d) versions of the hoek–brown strength criterion have been proposed by pan and hudson, singh, priest, zhang and zhu, and melkoumian et al  [1-2, 7-11]  among these 3d hoek–brown type criteria, the criterion of zhang and zhu can entirely inherit the advantages of the original hoek–brown strength criterion and has the same expression at both the triaxial and the biaxial states  the criterion was considered as a true 3d version of the generalized hoek–brown strength criterion and validated by numerous test data of intact rocks and jointed rock masses  the criterion of zhang and zhu was named as gzz strength criterion commonly [12] and has been accepted by other researchers on rock masses |

2015-140 	 clogging of drains and its influence on the stability of concrete dams |abstract  this paper discusses the most common forms of drain clogging and its influence on seepage under concrete dams built on permeable rock foundations  the increments of the uplift pressure caused by reduction in drain length or diameter, reduction of its effective flow section, reduction of flow to the drain and the reduction of the permeability of the rock mass around the drains is discussed  the parametric studies were based on a nonlinear numerical model developed for three dimensional seepage analyses of concrete dams with permeable continuous or fissured rock foundations  the main conclusions are that all causes abovementioned could induce clogging but some are more critical than others  reduction of the drain’s length, filling of the drains with granular or fine materials and joint clogging around the drains tend to be the more critical situations  dams sitting on high permeability materials are more susceptible to clogging than those with low permeability foundation since the flow captured by the drains is higher in the first case  the importance of proper drain maintenance to maintain the dam's stability is stressed    1  introduction  the upstream and downstream reservoirs, and seepage through the foundations, generate the main external forces acting upon a concrete dam  fig  1 indicates schematically these forces, plus the dam’s weight, for a typical concrete gravity dam, without drains |

2015-147 	 stress dependency of rock tensile strength |abstract: hydraulic fracturing is integral to geothermal and hydrocarbon recovery  rock tensile strength is overcome using a pressurized fluid during the initiation of a fracture  tensile strength has historically been assumed to be a stress independent property of rock depending solely on the rock type  previous studies on igneous rocks suggest otherwise  our experiments on berea and tennessee sandstone show a dependency of tensile strength on the confining stress  confined brazilian tests were carried out to observe the tensile fracture initiation and propagation under confined stress conditions  strain gauges recorded the deformation leading to and during failure  the measurements show a strong dependency of tensile strength on confining pressure; however, tests were limited to a maximum confining pressure of 1000 psi  as the strain data indicate, confining pressure hinders the microcrack growth and nucleation leading to higher tensile strengths with increasing confining pressure  tennessee sandstone which has a higher tensile strength at atmospheric pressure than berea sandstone shows slightly greater increased tensile strength with confining pressure  |1  introduction  |experimentally measured rock properties are employed to predict and interpret underground rock behavior  this transition between laboratory and field condition, however, needs delicate attention  properties such as rock compressive strength, fracture toughness, fracture energy, etc  depend, in fact, on the state of stress  in other words, they are a coupled function of material and in-situ condition  field scale hydraulic fracturing treatments (cleary et al  1991; shlyapobersky and chudnovsky, 1992) indicate apparently higher fracture energy than compared to unconfined laboratory measurements  fialko and rubin (1997) simulation of abou-sayed (1977) experiments show substantial dependence of fracture energy on the confining pressure  tensile strength is another parameter which is important for hydraulic fracturing treatments  to overcome the tensile strength, the pore pressure is increased injecting fluid under high pressure in the wellbore  the pump pressure builds up until the pressure is high enough to break the rock  this pressure is known as breakdown pressure at which the hydraulic fracture initiates | 
2015-148 	 nanoindentation creep measurements on shale |abstract  creep is a term used to describe the time dependent behavior of rock  knowledge of creep can be used to predict different phenomena such as reservoir subsidence associated with production, wellbore stability and proppant embedment problem  in this work, we investigate creep behavior at small scale using nanoindentation  after the initial nanoindentation loading stage, the indenter tip is held under constant maximum force for a period of time while deformation is recorded  the measured creep values are compared for different materials including soda-lime glass, lyons sandstone, sioux quartzite, pyrophyllite, and indiana limestone  the measurements on shales are then presented  the experiments measure comparably higher creep values for shale, i e  10 times higher than the one for fused silica  this creep depends strongly on the composition  it correlates positively with total organic carbon (toc) and clay content, while correlates negatively with carbonates  the measurements reveal a directionally dependent (anisotropic) creep with a higher value in the direction perpendicular to the bedding  mercury injection capillary pressure (micp) and acoustic velocity measurements are correlated with the creep  the measured creep value could be an indicator of the volume of smaller pore sizes (nanometer scale) which are extensively found in the organic and clay components    1  introduction  time dependent deformation of rock is an important factor for considerations of underground dynamics  this phenomenon can be predicted based on laboratory scale creep measurements under constant stress conditions  the behavior of rock under this constant stress usually consists of three distinct strain response stages  figure 1 symbolically illustrates these three different stages: 1) primary or decelerating, 2) secondary or “steady state”, and 3) tertiary or accelerating creep (heap e al , 2009)  the creep strain rate is derived using the linear portion (secondary stage)  nanoindentation method has been used successfully to evaluate various aspects of material mechanical behavior at a smaller scale  to name a few, oliver and pharr (1992) deduced hardness and modulus of the tested materials using the loading and unloading curves  fracture toughness can be estimated after modification (lawn an marshall, 1979)  fatigue and impact load can be applied using some modifications (beake et al , 2001)  bower et al , (1993) examined a creeping solid under nanoindentation  in this report, the nanoindentation method is employed to evaluate the creep behavior of the candidate rocks in a finer scale | 
2015-150 	 michell–fourier analytical treatment of stresses in the ring test under parabolic compression |abstract  this paper attempts to provide a simple analytical solution for the calculation of stress tensors induced in a linear elastic ring of a brittle material subjected to parabolic loading over two symmetric strips of its outer perimeter  using the michell- fourier series technique and airy stress functions, stress components are investigated in a tensile positive fashion  results are obtained in series form to facilitate parametric studies on the influence of the loading angle and geometric characteristics of the ring on the maximum tensile stress  results indicate that for a ring with a small hole, the type of the imposed stress is crucial in determining the distributions of the stress components inside the ring domain, although it becomes almost negligible for a ring with a relatively large hole  in contrast, a large inner to outer ratio influences significantly the stress values at critical points of the ring experiencing the maximum tensile stress   1  introduction  stress and displacement analysis of cylindrical annular bodies under arbitrary tractions is one of the classic topics of elasticity, with its major applications in machine design theory and strength measurement of materials [1]  the ring test has been widely accepted as an indirect laboratory technique for measuring the tensile strength of a material in the shape of a circular solid cylinder (disc) containing concentric holes subjected to lateral compression until a tensile failure occurs  the growing application of the ring test in geotechnical engineering, particularly in rock mechanics, is directly tied to the ease of sample preparation and its unique breakage mechanism in a pure tensile mode  there is a vast body of literature devoted to calculating the induced stresses in the ring test aimed at producing relationships for estimating the tensile strength of a test material as functions of the ring’s geometrical aspect ratio and the imposed contact conditions  timoshenko [2], filon [3], ripperger and davis [4], bortz and lund [5], hobbs [6], jaeger and hoskins [7], chianese and erdlac [8], and kourkoulis and markides [9], among others, have proposed analytical solutions for the ring problem  however, they are often limited to simplified stress assumptions at the contact, e g  line-forces or uniform radial stresses, or muskhelishvili's complex potentials [10] to account for the complicated boundary conditions, e g  parabolic contact loadings  despite the generality of complex-variable schemes; however, such approaches require excessive and complex mathematical rigour, limiting their application to broader disciplines  in contrast, focusing on the analytical-methodological aspect, this study attempts to construct a simpler and more convenient easy-to-use treatment for the study of stresses when the ring is subjected to parabolic radial compressive stresses over two finite arcs of its lateral surface (figures 1 and 2) | 
2015-152 	 hidden impact of mud loss on wellbore state of stresses disclosed by thermal-poro-elastic modeling |abstract  the thermal regime of a formation in the vicinity of a wellbore affects the stability of the well significantly during drilling operations, especially for deeper or geothermal wells  this paper describes how the thermal behavior of a tubular-wellbore-reservoir system is altered with time during mud loss, as well as its consequent impact on wellbore state of stresses and critical mud weights  a new coupled thermal-poro-elastic model, integrated with a transient tubular-wellbore-reservoir heat flow model, is developed to evaluate near-wellbore stresses and pore pressure redistribution during a mud loss  the results reveal that continuous mud loss destabilizes the near-wall region as the fracture gradient decreases over time  this can intensify the existing fracturing condition and allows the development of new fractures at other locations, which leads to further losses as time progresses  during severe losses, the fracture gradient at the bottom of the well can decrease by over 1 ppg within the first few hours  the time- dependent critical mud weight window and near-wellbore state of stresses under different lost circulation conditions and types of muds (obm/wbm) are presented to evaluate the effects of different parameters  this model allows prediction of a more realistic operating window during lost circulation by taking additional thermally-induced effects into account   1  introduction  wellbore instability is a major source of additional costs to drilling operations, and is therefore of paramount importance to avoid when drilling for petroleum production  it is more likely to occur when drilling in hostile environments, such as weak and/or reactive formations; formations with tectonically active beddings [1]; formation with unfavorable lithology sequences; and formation with high pressures and temperatures [2]  in addition, the increasing use of directional drilling and extended-reach drilling (erd)[3], as well as underbalanced drilling and multilateral drilling[4], has increased the difficulty of maintaining stability of the wells significantly[5,6]   wellbore stability problems have been extensively studied during the last few decades  many wellbore stability models have been developed to describe the physics of the systems by considering multiple effects, including but not limited to mechanical effects, pore pressure effects, chemical effects, and thermal effects  based on the effects that have been taken into account, the wellbore stability models can be categorized as: pure elastic model[7,8,9]; poro-elastic models[10,11]; thermal-poro-elastic models [2,12,13,14] ; chemo-poro-elastic models [15,16,17,18,19]; thermo-chemo-poro-elastic models [20,21], etc  | 
2015-157 	 numerical modeling of rock brazilian test: effects of test configuration and rock heterogeneity |abstract  the brazilian test was modeled with flac to investigate the effect of loading angle on stress distribution and failure mechanisms in homogeneous and heterogeneous rock samples  the model was first calibrated to data of a standard brazilian test of a pmma sample, found in the literature  then several numerical brazilian tests were performed using virtual materials with different deformability  the numerical results indicated that the loading angle (i e  contact length between the jaw and the disc) is not constant in the standard brazilian test and changes depending on the amount of applied load and the deformability of the disc  this means that the contact length will be larger for materials with higher tensile strength and lower young’s modulus  the contact length affects the distribution of both tensile and compressive stresses in the disc  therefore, it can influence the failure mechanism of the disc  if the contact length is low, probability of shear failure increases close to the loading region, and if it is high, tensile failure is more probable at the center of the disc   furthermore, uniaxial tensile (ut), standard brazilian (sb) and brazilian tests with constant loading angle of 30° (clab) were simulated  heterogeneities were introduced as inclusions with their tensile strength and young's modulus randomly selected from a normal distribution with different standard deviations  the analysis indicated that as the standard deviation of the young's modulus and tensile strength distribution increases, the recorded peak load and peak tensile strength decreases for the three tensile test configurations  however, ut is much more sensitive to the variability of tensile strength than of young's modulus  in contrast, the sb and clab tests indicated more sensitivity to young's modulus variability | 
2015-159 	 a simplified analysis of stresses in rising salt domes and adjacent sediments |abstract  we use a simple analytical model to estimate the stress field in and near density-driven, rising salt domes  we show that the salt pressure within such domes varies linearly along the dome but with a magnitude greater than the overburden stress  we also show that the salt dome changes both the magnitude and the direction of stresses in adjacent sediments: the maximum stress increases higher than the overburden stress, and the minimum stress drops below the regional one  the maximum stress lies and the minimum stress lies tangent to the dome boundary in the circumferential direction  the magnitude of the salt pressure and of the sediment stresses is estimated from the density profile of sediments  these predictions are shown to agree with field observations near salt domes  our results provide critical insight into the stress field perturbation in and near rising salt domes and can be used to assess the accuracy of numerical models and field measurements near these domes    1  introduction  salt domes can harbor significant oil reservoirs  salt’s extraordinary ductility makes salt domes an ideal seal to trap hydrocarbons flowing along margins of basins  in the gulf of mexico, the reservoirs trapped by salt domes are estimated to contain undiscovered recoverable resources of at least ~ 13 billion boe [1]    it is important to estimate the stress field in and near rising salt domes  wellbores are often drilled near and through these domes to reach hydrocarbon targets trapped near them [2-5]  the stability of these wellbores depends on the current state of stress near the domes  in contrast to sediments, salt cannot sustain differential stresses  to accommodate an isotropic stress state, salt deforms and causes substantial perturbation of the regional stress field in adjacent sediments  therefore, well-established approaches used to estimate the sediment stress field often fail near salt domes [6-9] because they have been derived for regional conditions [10-12] | 
2015-161 	 a parametric study of critical factors that affect stability induced by borehole mining in a coal deposit |abstract  a parametric analysis comparing the influence of different factors on predicted induced principal stress around the cavity roof was performed  a finite difference method (flac2d) was applied to study a cavity under internal pressure  the influence of internal pressure, cavity geometry (size and shape), horizontal stress, depth of was studied  the maximum normal stress criterion also known as coulomb’s criterion is based on the maximum normal stress theory  according to this theory failure occurs when the maximum principal stress reaches the ultimate strength of the material for simple tension  based on this theory, the largest principal stress will initiate cracks in the rock and lead to the failure of rock mass  the results show the high impact of internal pressure, cavity geometry (size and shape), and horizontal stress, depth of cover  a suggested algorithm is presented for applying two dimensional finite difference method in order to predict the maximum cavity size that can be obtained without stability concerns    1  introduction  the economic extraction of thin-seam coal deposits with thicknesses of less than 1 meter are often problematic due to several significant limitations associated with conventional mining methods, operating practices, and equipment  mines with low-seam heights are endemic of operations that possess low labor productivities, high operating costs, and relatively small production capacities  furthermore, the ability to implement new equipment and automation in order to efficiently exploit these thin-seams is hampered by the limited cash-flow positions of most of these operations and the inability to amortize their high costs over a sufficiently large resource base  consequently, these mines are usually small, labor intensive, and rely extensively on used and rebuilt equipment modified to operate in these challenging work environments | 
2015-162 	 tbm tunneling in discontinuous rock masses |abstract  with the application of tbm in the construction of tunnels, increasing simulations are taken on tbm tunnels  this paper first proposes the concept of utilizing block theory to simulate tbm tunnels in discontinuous rock masses and analyze the stability of surrounding rock blocks in tbm tunnels  therefore, block classification for tbm tunnels is set up according to the main differences between tbm tunnels and tunnels using traditional methods, which has laid the foundation of simulating a tbm tunnel  what' more, the identification of influenced block and the simulation procedure of a tbm tunnel are both illustrated in flowchart  also, a simple example of a double shield tbm tunnel excavation is implemented based on blklab and the corresponding removable blocks are analyzed  moreover, a representative excavation step is picked out to illustrate the removable blocks around the tbm, which meets the block classification for tbm tunnels   1  introduction  as one type of complex discontinuous medium, rock masses in nature are split into rock blocks by finite and infinite discontinuous geological planes  recently, the block theory [1] has developed rapidly as a stability analysis method of discontinuous rock masses  applying the block theory, researchers have carried out various analyses on the stability of blocks in the excavation of slopes, caverns and tunnels, from which reliable results have been achieved as well [2-7]   compared with traditional approaches of d&b (drilling and blasting) method and natm (new austrian tunneling method) in tunnel excavation, tbm method has the following advantages of fast heading rate, short construction period, favorable working environment, eco-friendliness and high comprehensive benefits, making it become the preferred choice at home and abroad  in recent years, researches on the simulation of tbm tunnels mainly focus on fem [8] and fdm [9], while the block theory has not ever been applied in the simulation of tbm tunneling | 
2015-164 	 study on weakening effect of structural plane and stability analysis for dam abutment of jinping i high arch dam |abstract  the jinping i high arch dam in china, with 305 m dam height, is the highest arch dam of the world at present  the overall stability of the dam and foundation is a protuberant problem due to the complex geological conditions at the dam site area and the weakening effect of the dam abutment weak structural planes when the project put into operation  in this paper, firstly, the weakening effect experimental research was carried out under the coupling interaction of stress field and seepage field  through the test, the weakening rates of the strength parameters of the weak structural planes were obtained  secondly, the three-dimensional geo-mechanical model comprehensive method test was carried out under reinforced foundation conditions  in the experiment, the integrated strength decreased range of weak structural plane was determined as 30% according to the weakening effect experimental results, and the temperature analogous materials were developed to simulate the weakening effect  through the test, the deformation characteristics and failure mechanisms of the dam and dam abutment were obtained  and the overall stability safety factors were determined as 5 2~6 0  the research results provide an important scientific basis for the design, construction and safe operation of the project   1  introduction  2 class soft rock and the green schist lens develops in the marble strata are also have the characteristic of decrease the mechanical parameters under the influence of water  after the impounding and operation of the high arch dam project, the mechanical properties of these weak rock masses and weak structural planes will be changed greatly  so that the strength weakening behavior has a serious impact on the stability and safety of the jinping i high arch dam and foundation, and these weak structural planes combine with high ground stress, high earthquake intensities and high hydraulic thrust will definitely control the stability of jinping i project  how to quantitatively reveal the weakening effect under thousands of tons of water load and long-term effect of complexity seepage field after the project put into operation, as well as to reasonably reconsider the weakening effect in evaluating the overall stability of high arch dam and foundation is a very important research subject | 
2015-165 	 a coupled geochemical-transport-geomechanical model to address caprock integrity during long-term co2 storage |abstract  underground storage of co2 will lead to chemical fluid-rock interactions which may potentially alter the porosity and the flow patterns in faults  in this study, we present a coupled numerical model combining chemical fluid-rock interactions, aqueous diffusion, fluid flow, and mechanical processes, aiming at a better understanding of mineral reactions leading to changes of the rock properties, the associated flow patterns and the mechanical stability of faulted caprock on the long-term (500 yrs)  in the examples that we studied the mechanical stability of the caprock system was not affected, but significant porosity changes were predicted for low-consolidated fault gouges  coupled chemical-flow modelling is preferred over chemical modelling as this showed significantly higher porosity increases   1  introduction  global emissions of carbon dioxide (co2 ) into the atmosphere, mainly as a result of fossil fuel burning and cement production, is believed to significantly influence global warming [1]  carbon capture and storage (ccs) is potentially able to reduce these emissions on a short to medium time scale by storing co2 in geological structures of the deep subsurface  the co2 is trapped below a sealing caprock in porous media like sandstones or carbonate rocks  one of the main risks associated with storage activities is the leakage of co2 into shallower regions of continental groundwater systems [2]  the release of co2 results preferentially in water acidification and potential mobilization of trace elements, which may have a toxic effect on the environment [3]  uncertainties are mainly related to potential leakage mechanisms, through faults and fractures, along wellbores and sealing caprock material, by convection and diffusion | 
2015-168 	 performance of drilled shafts socketed in the dead sea crystalline salt under short term vertical loading condition |abstract  drilled shafts socketed in crystalline rock salt are a common type of foundations used in the dead sea region to support high vertical and lateral loads  the existing subsurface condition consists of soft clay followed by crystalline salt  due to the difference in nature and geological features, the performance of such foundations type under vertical loading in the crystalline rock salt is different from their known behavior in common rock types  this paper is an attempt to understand the real behavior of socketed drilled shafts in crystalline salt through a finite element modeling of a field pile load test carried out in this formation  the studied case is of a steel tubular pile provided with a reinforced concrete socket in the crystalline salt formation  the prevailing salt layers in the pile test area are highly fractured crystalline rock salts of variable strength ranging from weak to moderately weak  full details of the pile load test, description of the subsurface conditions and salt strength tests are presented in this paper along with the finite element analysis details and results  the developed shear resistance along the socket length of the pile is verified and compared to the commonly used correlations for rock formations  the performed analyses and comparison with the field pile load test results provided a better understanding and good information about the drilled shafts performance under vertical loading condition in such formation  the analyses carried out in this paper deal with the short term behavior of the dead sea rock salt as the creep effect directly impact the long term performance   1  introduction  behavior of concrete piles socketed in rock depends on many factors such as the rock strength, rock quality, concrete strength, drilling fluids effect and roughness of the interface surface  rock characteristics are highly affected by the weathering and environmental conditions  finite element analysis (f e ) has proven a good ability to simulate the soil and rock behaviors in wide range of civil engineering applications  for the study of the performance of piles socketed in the dead sea crystalline rock salt using the f e  approach, choosing the reasonable constitutive model is an essential factor  accordingly, in this paper three different constitutive models that are the linear elastic (le), mohr-coulmob (mc) and the hardening soil (hs) have been investigated  the geotechnical parameters of the rock salt needed for the different models were estimated based on several sources that are the laboratory tests, in-situ tests and the back analysis of the field pile load test results  more emphasis in choosing the geotechnical parameters was given to the in-situ tests results and the back analysis outcome to eliminate the scale effect playing an important role in the laboratory tests results | 
2015-169 	 rock-burst simulations with 2d-dda: preliminary results |abstract  we investigate the mechanisms for rock-burst using the numerical discontinuous deformation analysis (dda) method  using recently developed non reflective boundary and excavation sequence modeling capabilities we are now able to model dynamic deformation in high in-situ stress environments more accurately than before  first we perform verifications of p-wave propagation through a one-dimensional elastic bar and confirm dda accuracy provided that the block length with respect to wave length is properly conditioned  we then test a newly developed radial p-wave propagation module to emulate an underground blast  we study two possible rock burst generation mechanisms: 1) due to strain relaxation as response to opening in high in situ stress environment, and 2) due to nearby blasting  a very strong relation between the initial stress and the velocity and acceleration of the ejected key blocks following the removal of the tunnel section is reported  we also find that the influence of blasting on rock burst phenomena is strongly related to the initial in situ stress level  we conclude that under relatively low in situ stress environments nearby blasting may indeed ejection of originally stable key blocks  however, under high in situ stress conditions strain relaxation poses a much greater rock-burst risk   1  introduction  a rock-burst is the sudden displacement of rock block that occurs in the boundary of an underground excavation, and causes substantial damage to the excavation [1]  due to the great risk to worker safety and the extensive damage to equipment, rock-bursts are considered to be one of the biggest unresolved problems in deep excavations   there are two basic rock-burst mechanisms: 1) strain relaxation that leads to the displacement of excavation surfaces, in which case the source and damage are concurrent, and 2) seismic wave propagation from energy redistribution that is induced by explosions and drilling in the excavation, in which case the source and the damage might be separate in distance and time [2] | 
2015-174 	 characteristics of mechanical wellbore failure and damage: insights of discrete element modelling and application to co2 storage |abstract  wellbore zonal isolation is particularly important for subsurface storage of co2 , where well integrity must be ensured for very long time spans  in this study, three dimensional discrete element models of wellbore systems have been used to simulate failure and damage of wellbore cement and surrounding rock  the models allow simulation of wellbore failure and damage in wellbore systems with different geometries and with perfect (idealized) or imperfect plug-casing-cement and cement sheath-rock interfaces  the aim is to determine critical stress conditions for mechanical wellbore failure and associated damage  comparison of model simulations with conventional geomechanical analysis is used to determine limits in injection pressures  if these limits are exceeded, wellbore failure and upward fluid migration through wellbore cement may occur due to alignment of fractures and the formation of connected fracture networks  imperfect cementation or a cement sheath that is not evenly distributed around the wellbore enhances local damage or failure  although the analysis relies on upper bounds on the changes in stresses around wellbores caused by an increase in pressure, it shows that loss of well integrity during injection of co2 or other fluids may occur, in particular by axial loading due to reservoir compaction   1  introduction  wells that penetrate subsurface co2 storage complexes may act as potential pathways for leakage of co2 to the surface [e g , 1-3]   for storage of co2 to be meaningful, well integrity has to be ensured for large injection volumes and over much longer time scales (100’s to 1000’s of years) than in the case of hydrocarbon production (10’s of years of depletion)  ensuring well integrity not only during injection period but also in the post-operational period over such long timescales represents a challenge for carbon capture and storage (ccs) projects that is not encountered before in the e&p industry  the long term-ability of wells to inhibit co2 migration has been identified as a significant potential risk for the long-term security of geological storage facilities [e g , 2]  the risk of leakage through “old” abandoned wells requires particular attention  regulations for well abandonment were less comprehensive than they are today  in addition, future use of abandoned reservoirs for co2 storage was not taken into account when old wells were completed and abandoned  the risks of leakage through abandoned wells may be a showstopper for a ccs project as it was in the case of co2 storage in the depleted de lier field in the north sea, offshore of the netherlands [4]  the project was discontinued after a feasibility assessment of ccs found that there was a high potential for leakage through old wells  repair of these wells was uneconomic and in some cases, technically impossible | 
2015-175 	 relative importance of thm effects during non-isothermal fluid injection in fractured media |abstract  rock mass treatment using fluid injection is common in various industrial applications, including enhanced recovery methods in the oil and gas industry, rock mass pre-conditioning in the mining industry, and heat extraction in geothermal systems  non-isothermal fluid injection requires consideration of the thermomechanical perturbation as well as hydro-mechanical processes  thermal effect is rarely included in injection analysis for geothermal application and thermal enhanced oil recovery methods, although with long times their impact becomes of first-order  in this paper, a fully-coupled, hybrid numerical model is implemented to study the effect of cold fluid injection into a conductive fracture under different injection/cooling schemes  the results show that the thermoelastic effect soon overwhelms the hydroelastic effect adjacent to the injection source, whereas far from the injection point, hydroelastic effect dominates because the pressure front always moves faster than the cold front  in addition, the fracture becomes more susceptible to shear failure in the presence of both thermoelastic and hydroelastic induced stresses for the case of cold fluid injection  the magnitude of the changes implies that an appropriate thermo-hydromechanical (thm) model is an essential key to address the physical behavior and potential impairment of fracture conductivity under thermal stimulation   1  introduction  rock mass treatment using fluid injection is common in various industrial applications  fluid is usually injected under a constant rate or injection pressure to fulfill the intended engineering goal of the stimulation practice  in the oil and gas industry, as an example, large volumes of water are injected at constant pressure during secondary recovery phase for waterflooding the oil-bearing reservoirs with low pressure (with respect to the minimum principal stress) to displace part of the remaining oil toward the production well [1]  in the mining industry, rock mass pre-conditioning using hydraulic fracturing may soon become standard practice for stope mining to facilitate caving propagation and fragmentation management [2]  on-going research interests are pursuing fluid injection as an in-situ stress and rock mass stiffness management tool [2, 3] | 
2015-176 	 induced rockbursts and inherent rockbursts |abstract  this paper attempts to investigate the mechanism of induced rockbursts and inherent rockbursts of pillars in hard rock mines  by considering rockbursts as an instability (buckling) problem of structures, rockbursts are classified into induced rockbursts and inherent rockbursts according to their occurrence with or without dynamic stimulation forces  induced rockbursts occur where the causative factor is dynamic loadings, whereas inherent rockbursts happen only when a mining structure becomes unstable under static loadings  rigorous mathematical models are set up for these two rockbursts  for induced rockbursts, the quantitative relation between induced blasting and rockbursts is established and parametric resonance mechanism is found  for inherent rockbursts, the condition of critical static loads is obtained  contrary to conventional methods where only rock materials or rock specimens were used to study rockbursts, this investigation attaches more attention on the structural effect on rockbursts, which tends to appeal to practising engineers   1  introduction  rockbursts are sudden and violent failure of rocks, which may lead to high fatality rates, losses in production and equipment, and a detrimental influence on the recruitment of labor  in spite of the increased use of microseismic monitoring, improvements in the associated instrumentation and widespread applications of seismological data analysis techniques, the mechanism of rockbursts in underground rock engineering is still not well understood  ortlepp said that “it is probably true that rockbursts have been the mining hazard that is the least understood and the most feared” [1]  in the 16th annual kenneth finlay memorial lecture in australia, suorineni (2013) claimed that rockburst is the cancer in geomechanics of contemporary deep mining | 
2015-179 	 a micromechanical study of the interactions between a hole and a crack under compression using pfc2d |abstract  the interactions between defects are important in the behavior of brittle materials  the micromechanical interactions between a circular hole and a crack under uniaxial compression are investigated in this paper  experiments of specimens containing a hole and a crack are conducted  subsequently, particle flow code 2d (pfc2d) is adopted to simulate the fracture behavior  the crack initiation, propagation and coalescence with a hole are investigated  the propagating cracks contain first cracks and secondary cracks  both first cracks and secondary cracks will disturb the stress field and displacement field  the dem simulation explains the initiation position of secondary cracks observed in experiments, which is not necessarily located at the crack tips or on crack surfaces, but possibly in the intact part of the specimen at a distance away from the pre-existing crack  the hole will influence the crack initiation stress of the pre-existing crack and attract the propagating cracks  the present research paves the way for using the dem to simulate the micromechanical interactions between a hole and a crack   1  introduction  the interactions between a crack and a circular hole in rocks have been studied previously [1]  however, the prior study focused on the fracture phenomena by experiments and did not analyze the inherent mechanism in-depth  further, the interactions were interpreted by micromechanics [2]; however, the cracking behavior was ignored  the cracking process around a hole was examined in uniaxial compression tests in some papers and relative mechanism was interpreted [3,4]  compared with the studies of specimens with a hole, there are much more research of specimens with pre-existing cracks in a brittle material  wong and einstein [5] observed and characterized the fracture behavior in gypsum and carrara marble specimens containing a single crack under uniaxial compression and identified different crack types based on their geometry and propagation mechanism  cracking behavior were investigated containing two parallel open flaws experimentally at macroscopic and microscopic level [6,7]  specimens under the biaxial compression test were also investigated [8]  not only open flaws, but also closed flaws in a brittle material had been studied [9]  specimens with 3 and 16 cracks were made and tested in compression tests [10]  however, these investigations did not consider the situation containing both a crack and a hole | 
2015-180 	 remote structural mapping and discrete fracture networks to calculate rock fall volumes at tornado mountain, british columbia |abstract  design of rock fall protection structures requires information about the rock fall volume distribution  when this information is not available, rock fall volumes can be estimated based on structural information about the rock fall sources  this paper examines a rock fall source where known measurable rock falls occur  as is common, the source was inaccessible for bench scale mapping and the mapping was carried out using remote photogrammetric techniques  a discrete fracture network of the source was developed based on the remote mapping  volume calculations followed three approaches, 1) direct measurement of loose blocks, 2) simple estimates of block dimensions, and 3) modeling of a 3-dimensional volume of rock based on the discrete fracture network  the calculations were compared against fallen rock blocks surveyed on site  the volume calculations based on the discrete fracture network were in agreement with those surveyed on site   1  introduction  design of rock fall protection structures requires information about the trajectory of the falling rock blocks and their volume [1,2,3,4]  rock fall spatial distribution and heights are direct input for locating and dimensioning these structures, and falling block velocities and volumes (therefore their masses) are used to calculate the impact energies to be supported  rock fall velocities are typically calculated using trajectory models calibrated against previous rock fall occurrences [5,6,7,8]  rock fall volumes can be calculated from previous events if records are available, or from estimations of block sizes at the rock fall source [9,10,11]  the frequency distributions of rock fall velocities and volumes are combined to calculate the distribution of impact energies at any given location, which forms the basis for a reliability-based design of the protection structure | 
2015-182 	 the influence of fracturing fluids on fracturing processes: a comparison between gas and water |abstract  conventional water-based fracturing treatments may not work well for many shale gas reservoirs  this is due to the fact that shale gas formations are much more sensitive to water because of the significant capillary effects and the potentially high contents of swelling clay, each of which may result in the impairment of productivity  as an alternative to water-based fluids, gaseous stimulants not only avoid this potential impairment in productivity, but also conserve water as a resource and may sequester greenhouse gases underground  during the gas fracturing processes, gas will penetrate into the borehole wall due to the low surface tension and low dynamic viscosity of the fluid and the evolution of the fractures results from the coupled phenomena of gas flow, solid deformation and damage  to represent this, a coupled model of rock damage mechanics and gas flow is presented  we investigate the fracturing processes driven by pressurization of gas within a borehole and compare it with water-based fracturing  simulation results indicate that gas fracturing indeed has a lower breakdown pressure, as observed in experiments, and may develop fractures with greater complexity than those developed with water-based fracturing  we explore the relation between the fracture initiation pressure, breakdown pressure and complexity of fractures to both the interfacial tension and the dynamic viscosity of the fracturing fluids  it is shown that the fracture initiation pressure and breakdown pressure increase and the complexity of the resulting fracture networks decreases with increasing interfacial tension and dynamic viscosity  these conclusions are consistent with experimental observations   1  introduction  as an important product from unconventional reservoirs, shale gas has been produced commercially and is increasingly recognized as a “game changer” for the u s  natural gas and energy markets in the past few years [1]  shale gas is trapped inside formations of shale, which are fine grained sedimentary rocks with very low permeability, and more than 90% of the shale gas reservoirs need treatments to enhance their productivity, such as fracturing and acidizing [2] | 
2015-189 	 analysis of stress variations with depth in the permian basin spraberry/dean/wolfcamp shale |abstract  this research examines stress variations with depth in the permian basin spraberry/dean/wolfcamp shale to understand why many microseismic events occur at upper formations when we hydraulically fracture the lower formations  an interesting phenomenon of drilling-induced tensile fractures is observed in the image log  that is, there are drilling-induced tensile fractures in the spraberry and dean formations, but there are no drilling-induced tensile fractures in the wolfcamp formation  this brings out a question: how variable is the stress state with depth? we estimate the pore pressure and the three principal stresses with depth to answer this question  the pore pressures and minimum principal stresses are analyzed from the diagnostic fracture injection test, which are consistent with literatures  maximum horizontal stress in the spraberry formation is constrained by observation of drilling-induced tensile fractures, while maximum horizontal stress in the wolfcamp formation is constrained through the estimation of uniaxial compressive strength  we find the stresses in the wolfcamp formation are more isotropic than those in the spraberry formation  more importantly, the decreasing of the pore pressure gradient and the frac gradient when going from the lower formation to the upper formation leads to many out-of-zone microseismic events   1  introduction  the permian basin represents one of the nation’s oldest and most widely recognized hydrocarbon bearing regions  unlike other plays such as the bakken and eagle ford, the permian shows much greater geologic complexity, consisting of several unique sub-basins (fig  1), each with its own unique characteristics [1]   the specific area studied in this research is in midland basin, which is east of the central basin platform, west of the eastern shelf, and north of the val verde basin  the formations discussed in this paper are the spraberry, dean, and wolfcamp series, which are at the bottom of the permian system  the three formations are mainly shale facies, but with high mechanical complexity  fig  2 shows the wells we studied, which are drilled in the spraberry/dean/wolfcamp formations  most data, including sonic log data, formation microresistivity image (fmi) data, and core test data, come from the monitor well m  besides, we analyze the diagnostic fracture injection test (dfit) in four horizontal wells, a, b, c, and d  | 
2015-190 	 experimental demonstration of delayed initiation of hydraulic fractures below breakdown pressure in granite |abstract  a laboratory investigation has been carried out to investigate delayed initiation of hydraulic fractures where wellbore pressures are insufficient to induce instantaneous breakdown  the delayed initiation process we are investigating is related to so-called static fatigue, which refers to a property of many brittle/quasi-brittle materials, including rocks, to fail in a delayed manner when subjected to an applied stress that does not exceed the material strength  in this paper, we experimentally verify a limiting case of a theoretically predicted delay time of initiation for given wellbore pressures  the investigation has two parts: characterization of the static fatigue behavior of a given rock and hydraulic fracture initiation experiments  for rock characterization, three-point and four-point bending tests are used to obtain time to failure versus applied tensile stress relationships for coldspring charcoal granite specimens  then, using an apparently geometry-independent static fatigue parameter and classical hydraulic fracture breakdown theories, we predict and subsequently test the time to failure for different wellbore pressures in the laboratory  we present our laboratory observations and measurements on delayed failure of axially oriented hydraulic fracture initiation  our results verify the existence of delayed initiation of hydraulic fractures, and they demonstrate the ability of straightforward theoretical considerations to predict the initiation time  comparison between experimental data and prediction also suggests that the effect of fluid penetration plays an important role in delayed initiation, evidenced by the tendency for the longer-time initiations at lower pressures to fall below the theoretical prediction   1  introduction  most approaches to stimulation of horizontal wellbores rely on initiation and growth of more than one hydraulic fracture  past studies on the topic of initiation of hydraulic fractures predict the wellbore pressure at which initiation will occur [1-6]  in the classical hydraulic fracture breakdown models (hubbert and willis [1] and haimson and fairhurst [2]), initiation will not occur if the near-wellbore tensile stress induced by fluid pressure is less than the tensile strength of the rock formation  however, it has been observed in many laboratory experiments that brittle/quasi-brittle materials, including rocks, can be caused to fail after a period of time when subjected to a sustained static load that is lower than its strength [7, 8]  this behavior is referred to as “static fatigue ” in one recent example, kear and bunger [8] show that for a crystalline gabbroic rock, applying a load as low as 75% of its nominal tensile strength onto the sample can cause failure within a few hours  therefore, the concept of tensile static fatigue in brittle/quasi-brittle rocks leads to the central question of this paper: is it possible for a hydraulic fracture to be initiated under wellbore pressure less than critical breakdown pressure? we seek an answer by theoretical study and laboratory experimentations | 
2015-196 	 impounding deformation analysis for jointed rock slope based on generalized effective stress |abstract  reservoir impoundment is a complicated problem in hydraulic engineering  it’s related to different scientific phenomena in different scales, such as valley width contraction near the dam, reservoir bank slope deformation, and reservoir-induced earthquake in the basin-scale  pore pressure increases as water level rises up, and causes material degradation and strength reduction in several ways  the effective stress law made a remarkable success in describing the mechanical behavior of saturated soil, but its application is still limited in rock materials, especially when it comes to elasto-plastic constitutive relation  a generalized effective stress concept in elasto-plastic model for fractured rock is presented and applied in the slope deformation assessment during reservoir impoundment  the observed slope deformation during impounding process is introduced and explained  the additional plastic deformation induced by the increasing fracture pressure is the main factor of slope deformation  a case study is provided of the left bank slope of jinping-i high arch dam  the results show that the drucker-prager criterion embedded with the concept of effective stress describes accurately the measured values of slope deformation, and this method is efficient and useful in the deformation and hazard assessment of hydraulic engineering projects   1  introduction  a number of high arch dams have been designed and constructed in southwest china in recent years, including xiluodu arch dam (285 5m high), xiaowan arch dam (292m high), jinping-i arch dam (305m high), dagangshan arch dam (210m high) et al  the rock slopes in the dam sites are characterized by large-scale, high geostress and developed fractures  although high safety factors are achieved in the optimized schemes of the dams, the impounding deformation of slopes and its influence to the dams are still of great significance  typical hydraulic catastrophes related to the impounding process include the vajont dam, the malpasset dam and some other cases  the vajont dam suffered from a reservoir-induced landslide and the catastrophic consequences, which occurred 3 years later after the initial impoundment [1-3]  the failure of the malpasset dam was attributed by some investigations to the seepage forces in the fractures of foundation [4-6]  the dam heel cracking of kolnbrein arch dam was also during the initial impoundment [7] | 
2015-197 	 coupled numerical simulation of formation rock and cement sheath effect on vertical cased well fracturing |abstract  in vertical cased well, cement sheath is mainly used to support casing, seal off annulus, isolate porous zones, and protect the casing from corrosive formation fluids  during the production, the integrity of casing-cement-formation system is generally damaged by perforating and fracturing processes, leading to failure of hydraulic fracturing operation  previous studies on cement sheath rarely involve coupled numerical simulation applied to hydraulic fracturing, gaining scarce industrial experience  in this paper, a coupled numerical model for fracturing operation in vertical cased well has been set up by flac3d(fast lagrangian analysis of continuain in three dimensions), to analyze the effect of formation and cement sheath on the integrity of casing-cement-formation system  the results show that cement with low young's modulus and high poisson's ratio is crucial to retain the integrity of the casing-cement-formation system  fracturing operation should be initiated in sections of cement with lower young's modulus and higher poisson's ratio, and formation with higher young's modulus and lower poisson's ratio  this numerical coupled model not only can gain insight on interaction of casing, cement and formation, but also optimize the design of perforating operation for reservoir stimulation in vertical cased well    1  introduction  during well cementing operation, cement hardens to form cement sheath, and then form the casing-cement-formation system  cementing is an important procedure for well completion  the ultimate purpose is to provide effective zonal isolation of the formation which have been penetrated by the wellbore  once a well is put into product, the wellbore conditions will change under various processes, such as the perforation of the casing, fracturing stimulation, acid treatment, etc  pressure increases when perforation accompanied with the firing of the guns can lead to cement damage  if fracturing stimulation or acid treatment is adopted, the increase of the wellbore pressure is more harmful to the casing-cement-formation system because the fluid pressure is high and the fluid injection lasts from minutes to hours  moreover, the change of outer loading can be applied to the cement sheath  for example, the pressure on the external surface of the cement sheath will increase because of formation creep  in this case, it may lead to fracture propagation or annulus cracks around the cement sheath, eventually lead to the failure of fracturing operation  scholars have done a lot of experiments to study the properties of cement sheath[1,2]  many scholars also studied the effect of wellbore pressure on the cement sheath, used the analytical model to predict well life and used the finite element model to simulate the actual working conditions[3] | 
2015-198 	 a method for simulation of longwall goaf |abstract  this paper describes a method for simulating the goaf of mechanized longwall panels at shallow depth in various coal mines in india for prediction of subsidence, abutment pressure and stresses over goaf and barrier pillars  proper modelling of goaf is necessary for the accurate prediction of stress distribution around the face and subsidence at the surface  in this paper, the broken rock debris has been modeled as a non-linear stress strain characteristic  two characteristic properties have been identified to describe the stress-strain behaviour  this study is undertaken to find out the goaf properties for seven previously worked longwall panels  a numerical model is developed in flac3d, a finite difference modelling tool and the modelling procedure has been described  the results obtained from modelling were compared with field observations in case of subsidence and theoretical values in case of stress distribution over the stabilized goaf and average load on barrier pillars  this paper provides the characteristic values for the goaf properties for the three different roof-rock type which may be used for simulating the goaf   1  introduction  as the longwall face advances, the immediate roof overlying the coal seam, consisting of weak beds, readily cave behind the supports  the main roof lying above the immediate roof consists of strong rock beds and is selfsupporting within a certain roof span  this remains intact and exerts pressure on the barrier pillars and coalface  with the progress of mining, it eventually fails and caves in as main fall   as the size of the worked out area i e  the goaf increases, it gets filled up with fragmented rock material that provides resistance to the lowering of the relatively intact strata  the amount of resistance offered by the goaf depends on its compaction and caving behaviour of the overlying roof rocks  proper modelling of goaf is necessary for the accurate prediction of stress distribution around the face and the load exerted on the face support system for designing the parameters such as support density and resistance | 
2015-201 	 numerical modelling of rock mechanics experiments as an input for coupled hydromechanical simulation |abstract  numerical simulation is the main method to predict and manage petroleum reservoirs, in which, traditionally, rock compressibility, that cannot well represent stress-strain behavior of the rock, is the only geomechanical parameter taken into account  considering this, a more complete representation of rock mechanical behavior is a key point for any hydromechanical numerical analysis, starting with rock mechanics and petrophysical lab experiments, followed by numerical calibration  in this work modified drucker-prager and mohr-coulomb constitutive models have been adopted for numerical modeling of rock mechanics experiments on different carbonate types  hydromechanical behavior has also been numerically assessed for some of the tested samples, aiming for the construction of a pore pressure – porosity – permeability variation table, which allowed the use of pseudo-coupling  in this way, geomechanical effects were taken to reservoir simulation, obtaining a good relation between computational cost and accuracy   1  introduction  the main method to predict and manage petroleum reservoirs is numerical simulation in which, traditionally, rock compressibility is the only geomechanical parameter taken into account  during exploitation, though, reservoir-rock deforms, causing porosity and permeability variation, phenomenon that cannot be represented by compressibility  considering this, a more complete representation of rock stress-strain behavior is a key point for any hydromechanical numerical analysis  a good mechanical characterization of a geomaterial based on rock mechanics and petrophysical lab experiments is a starting point, followed by numerical calibration of rock behavior observed in laboratory  this last stage can be done via lab experiments modelling, aiming to obtain mechanical and elastic parameters that best represent the stress-strain rock behavior, based on a proper constitutive model   this paper intends to describe a methodology based on numerical modeling of lab experiments to take to reservoir simulation the geomechanical effects due to exploitation  for this, three examples of numerical modelling of experiments, and one example of pseudocoupling application are presented, all based on carbonate rock data | 
2015-204 	 calibrated acoustic emission system records m -3 5 to m -8 events generated on a saw-cut granite sample |abstract  acoustic emission (ae) analyses have been used for decades for rock mechanics testing, but because ae systems are not typically calibrated, the absolute sizes of dynamic microcrack growth and other physical processes responsible for the generation of aes are poorly constrained  we describe a calibration technique for the ae recording system as a whole (transducers + amplifiers + digitizers + sample + loading frame) that uses the impact of a 4 76 mm free-falling steel ball bearing as a reference source  we demonstrate the technique on a 76 mm diameter cylinder of westerly granite loaded in a triaxial deformation apparatus at 40 mpa confining pressure  in this case, the ball bearing is dropped inside a cavity within the sample while inside the pressure vessel  we compare this reference source to conventional aes generated during shear loading of a saw-cut simulated fault in a second granite sample at confining pressures up to 120 mpa  all located aes occur on the saw-cut surface and have moment magnitudes ranging from m -5 7 down to at least m -8  dynamic events that rupture the entire simulated fault surface (stick-slip events) have measurable stress drop and macroscopic slip, and radiate seismic waves similar to those from a m -3 5 earthquake  the largest ae events that do not rupture the entire fault are m -5 7  for these events, we also estimate the corner frequency (200- 300 khz), and we assume the brune earthquake source model to estimate source dimensions of 4-6 mm  these ae sources are larger than the 0 2 mm grain size and smaller than the 76 <u+00d7> 152 mm fault surface  finally, we compare our results to other calibrated ae studies performed on different loading machines and discuss reasons for the observed maximum ae magnitude   1  introduction  acoustic emissions (aes) are tiny seismic events thought to be caused by microcracking or slip instability on the grain scale  they are sometimes recorded during rock mechanics experiments to monitor fracture and faulting processes [1]  in slow loading experiments on rock samples containing pre-existing artificial faults, aes tend to cluster around stick-slip instabilities (dynamic events that involve slip of the entire fault surface) in a manner reminiscent of foreshocks and aftershocks  it has long been assumed that aes are in some sense small-scale versions of earthquakes and that they can provide insights into earthquake mechanics [2- 5]  yet, while earthquakes are routinely quantified by their seismic moment, only rarely is the absolute size of an ae determined  this is because ae recording systems are not typically calibrated | 
2015-206 	 a case study for wellpath optimization and drilling risk reduction for vaca muerta shale in argentina |abstract  a modified numerical model has been used in optimizing the drilling performance and field integrity in vaca muerta formation of the neuquen basin of argentina  in-situ stress analysis provided a steadily oriented stress tensor and principal stress magnitudes consistent with the normal fault stress regime that was confirmed with drilling and well log data  an integrated wellbore-integrity study was conducted to solve instabilities including stuck pipe and tight holes encountered during drilling operations at the offset wells, to optimize future drilling procedures, to maximize the drilling margin for the prospective wells, and to reduce drilling risks  the geomechanical model was coupled with in-situ stress and formation property anisotropies, temperature alteration, shale-fluid physico-chemical interactions, and the flow-induced stress using mohr-coulomb and mogi-coulomb failure criteria  the well trajectory, drilling-fluid density and types of water-based muds were confirmed to have a dominant impact on the occurrence of instabilities experienced while drilling and completion  core data, imaging and sonic scanner logs along with conventional log data were utilized to obtain in-situ stress magnitudes, orientations and formation properties  the stochastic risk and sensitivity analysis were performed using thirteen well data to evaluate the sensitivity of the input data on the study outcome  results show that higher mud weight is expected to minimize wellbore instabilities  results of the wellbore integrity analysis presented in this study will benefit the remediation and/or prevention of wellbore instabilities for improving economic viability and sustainability of the field development in vaca muerta formation   1  introduction  the vaca muerta formation is lithologically associated with the late jurassic calcareous and silicoclastic mixed shale that was deposited along the northwestern part of the argentinean patagonia in the neuquen basin (fig  1)  it is a lithostratigraphic unit that can be easily recognized in outcrops as organic-rich marls (fig  2)  the composing sedimentary architecture corresponds to a distal facies of a mixed carbonate sequence developed between the jurassic tithonian and valanginian ages  this highly prolific source rock was deposited during the tithonian (late jurassic) transgression that took place in the neuquen basin that rapidly flooded the underlying eolian and fluvial units of the tordillo formation (kimmeridgian)  this transgression marks the maximum basin expansion of the marine environment that extended for about 30,000 km2[1] | 
2015-207 	 rock mechanical dimensioning of gas storage caverns in the salt dome edge region |abstract  in recent years, the number of new and planned gas storage caverns has increased, so that optimization of the existing salt deposits and especially the question of the minimum allowable distance between the cavern and the salt dome boundaries became important  although caverns were built in the salt dome boundaries in recent years, however, no dimensioning concept was previously published worldwide   this paper deals with creating a concept for rock mechanical dimensioning of gas storage caverns in the salt dome edge area  within this dimensioning concept it has to be demonstrated that caverns can be operated gas tight and stable in this location  the analysis of the formation of salt deposits and possibilities of exploration of a salt dome represents an important basis for the model buildup and evaluation of a cavern in the salt dome edge region   a numerical model was created that takes into account the essential and non-negligible influences in the salt dome edge area  furthermore time-dependent, thermo-mechanical coupled numerical calculations were carried out  the influences of different model variations were analyzed regarding the cavern surrounding stress state   based on the calculation results, the effects of varying the parameters on the cavern surrounding stress state were discussed and assessed  here, the dimensioning parameters maximum and minimum internal pressures as well as the pressure change rates of the cavern were analyzed for a cavern in salt dome edge region  an important role for the evaluation of the stress state of the cavern in the salt dome edge region plays the stress intensity index of the rock salt   within this paper a dimensioning concept is shown which includes beneath the recommendation for the selection of a suitable calculation model of a cavern in the border region of a salt dome a dimensioning parameter as a recommendation for the minimum distance between the cavern wall and the salt dome boundary   1  introduction  in germany salt caverns are used to store liquid and gaseous energy sources like natural gas and crude oil for over 40 years  as part of the increased demand for fossil fuels, the incipient liberalization of the gas market and the changing usage with respect to the operation of the cavern storage facilities numerous new caverns were planned at various locations in germany and leached in recent years |

2015-212 	 a practical log-based approach on assessing and preventing wellbore instability considering both mechanical and shale swelling effects |abstract  various techniques and drilling practices have been developed to remedy drilling problems owing to shale swelling; however, a quantitative estimation of shale swelling potential has been difficult to establish in the oilfield  the cation exchange capacity is one parameter that has been shown to control the swelling of shales both qualitatively and quantitatively  a correlation derived from basic physical principles for the cation exchange capacity (cec) of shale formations using common log data of temperature, resistivity, and sonic slowness has been modified using available core and cuttings test data  cation exchange capacity is then used to distinguish problematic, smectite-rich shale formations from the trouble-free, illite-rich formations using a threshold value  an empirical relationship that involves calculated values of cec and thresholds is then developed to estimate the osmotic pressure resulting from an imbalance of water activities—in effect, estimating a higher mud weight needed to stabilize the well  this methodology was applied to a well drilled in the north sea combined with mechanical wellbore-stability analysis and shows good agreement with wellbore enlargement and well events  the technique has multi-fold benefits, including identifying problematic drilling intervals owing to the abundance of smectite, estimating the minimum mud weight necessary to prevent drilling problems owing to shale swelling, and ultimately determining whether a well is drillable with a water-based mud system   1  introduction  wellbore instability is a challenge when drilling through shale formations with a water-based mud  shale instability may lead to stuck pipe, shale sloughing, and a low-quality or even a lost wellbore  causes of wellbore instability in shales may be separated into two main categories—mechanical and chemical   mechanical wellbore instability in shales results from mechanical failure of weak rock formations owing to stresses in the vicinity of the wellbore  shear failure along weak bedding planes—an example of strength anisotropy that often afflicts shale formations—also falls into this category | 
2015-214 	 wellbore instability during plasma torch drilling in geothermal reservoirs |abstract  this study focuses on analyzing thermal effects produced by plasma torch on rock physical parameters, designed to assist operations during geothermal well drilling  plasma torch can interact with samples and reduce rock strength  in the presented theoretical model it is noticed that elasticity modulus (young’s modulus) and temperatures play important roles in thermal stress distribution  the results show that at 4500°c with 6mpa compressive loading elasticity modulus is the best situation for wellbore instability  by contrast, at 1500°c with a loading of 38mpa elasticity modulus is a suitable result for stability of the borehole  in experimental work it is found that 7 to 10 seconds plasma torch traction with cylindrical specimen rock samples can generate thermal fractures  elasticity modulus of all granite and limestone samples was sharply dropped after 10 seconds of plasma torch interaction with each dry rock sample on account of the fact that visible cracks generate on the surface   1  introduction  in recent years, problems associated with drilling oil and gas wells around large urban settlements have become a major limitation to underground drilling, particularly in relation to environmental damages in highly populated or industrialized areas  therefore, the development of underground drilling mechanisms is of high priority [1- 6]  hard-rock drilling is an expensive process because the drill string machines and bottom hole assembly must be extremely rugged and powerful to overcome the intact hard rocks [3-10]  we present a method to assist improving hard rock drilling machines, which is achieved by developing techniques to weaken the rock before it is mechanically removed [9-12]  this is obtained by generating uniform holes inside of rock textures during drilling and perforation operation [10- 13]  recently it has been reported that making of holes inside the intact rocks may not be a suitable method [9- 12]  it is proposed that a proper method to change the hard rock into a loss rock can be achieved by generating fractures into the rock texture [10-13]  the fractures can be generated by generating a high temperature gradient within the rock  temperature increase causes expansion and eventually breakdown  one way to induce a proper temperature gradient is by using the plasma torch in order to assist the drilling operation  during thermally assisted drilling operation fractures are generated inside of the wellbore and this can reduce the wall strength considerably [19-20]  a plasma arc torch can generate that temperature into the rock and material texture [30- 34] |

2015-219 	 a comparison of stress evolution in single-layer and multilayer buckle folds |abstract  buckle folds of single-layer and multilayer sedimentary strata characterized are among the most common structural traps for hydrocarbon reservoirs  the spatio-temporal evolution of the stress state in folded reservoirs is of significant importance for the understanding and predicting patterns of fractures associated with buckle folds  this paper compares the evolution of the principle stress state associated with buckle folding by studying the deformation process of two different geometries: single-layer and multilayer buckle folds  a 3d finite element modeling approach is applied to simulate the buckle folding of single-layer and multilayer stacks with maxwell visco-elastic rheology  it is concluded that the stress state within the folding layer(s) are determined by the buckling process, fold geometry and material parameters  this study shows that the presence of the competent layers has a governing influence on the amplification rate of fold amplitude and the evolution of the strain/stress field  the lowest magnitude of effective minimum principle stress is found at the top of the hinge of the bottom competent layer in the three-layer system and central competent layer in the five-layer system  moreover, layer-parallel extensional strain and low magnitudes of layer-parallel principle stress is observed between the limb and the hinge of the central competent layer in the five-layer system  little differential stress develops throughout the folding layer in the less competent layer(s)  this study also shows that tensile fractures perpendicular and parallel to the fold axis at the hinge and in the limb can be explained by the developed overpressure in low permeability rock  in summary, this study shows that strain distribution and stress evolution within buckle folds are directly dependent on the number of competent layer(s) and the distribution of material parameters    1  introduction  fold systems in deformed rock are considered as common structural trap systems for petroleum reservoirs  understanding the mechanics of folding and associated natural fracture systems is essential for a better understanding of hydrocarbon migration and production [1]  in nature, multilayer folds are more frequent than single-layer folds [2]  the structural development of multilayer systems during buckle fold evolution have been extensively studied by either considering the competent and incompetent layers as separate objects [e g , 3, 4] or treating the multilayer system as a homogeneous but anisotropic body by applying average properties [e g , 5-7]  more recent studies have applied different approaches including thin-beam equations [e g , 3, 8 and 9] and fluid dynamics [e g  5, 10-13] to study folding in multilayer system  the observed fold shapes and the tectonic history of multilayer system are found to be dependent on various parameters, such as the amount of bulk shortening [14], layer thickness [12], the rheology [15], the viscosity ratio [16,17], and the type of active folding [2]  moreover, a detailed analysis on the strain evolution of a two-layer fold system has been performed by using finite strain ellipses and the two layers are found to form parallel folds with changing thickness between them [18] | 
2015-221 	 a new method to measure tri-axial static strain change based on relative displacements between points for open pit slopes and underground structures |abstract  all rock excavations by means of natural gravity caving, mechanical excavation or blasting cause redistribution of the static stress and strain in the remaining rock mass  it is critical to measure the change of the strain state  such a measurement can serve as quantification of the damage and of the effectiveness of a blast design or an excavation method  secondly, the measurement can be used to monitor slope or mine structure stability to improve the mine safety   at present, there is no method available to calculate strain changes over a large area of a rock slope or an underground structure  new technologies developed over the last few decades; such as gps, radar systems, three dimensional photogrammetry and multi-sensor displacement monitoring, are also used nowadays to monitor displacement  if a strain calculation method is developed, the data may be used to calculate distributions of three dimensional strain tensors in the slope or highwall  without a strain calculation method, the data can only give displacement change at discrete monitoring spots   this paper presents a method for measuring the change of the static strain state at a remaining rock mass or ground associated with operations of excavations, such as blasts, mechanical means or gravitational caving of a portion of the ground  the method is based on measuring coordinates of selected points with recent accurate survey techniques before and after an excavation  the paper also shows that for small deformation the different reference points for survey before and after an excavation can be used, which provides great convenience in practical measurement   the calculation of the strain change is done by solving a set of simultaneous equations for the displacement gradients  with the number of survey points larger than the minimum number required, the number of the independent equations is greater than the number of unknowns and minimizes measurement errors  | 
2015-222 	 boundary element analysis of non-planar three-dimensional cracks using complex variables |abstract  this paper reports new developments on the complex variables boundary element approach for solving three-dimensional problems of cracks in elastic media  these developments include implementation of higher order polynomial approximations and more efficient analytical techniques for evaluation of integrals  the approach employs planar triangular boundary elements and is based on the integral representations written in a local coordinate system of an element  in-plane components of the fields involved in the representations are separated and arranged in certain complex combinations  the cauchy- pompeiu formula is used to reduce the integrals over the element to those over its contour and evaluate the latter integrals analytically  the system of linear algebraic equations to find the unknown boundary displacement discontinuities is set up via collocation  several illustrative numerical examples involving a single (penny-shaped) crack and multiple (semi-cylindrical) cracks are presented   1  introduction  accurate three-dimensional modeling of fracture is of key importance for rock mechanics applications such as simulation of mining in faulty rock or computer simulation of hydraulic fracturing  in both applications, the boundary element method (bem) can serve as an efficient tool for realistic modeling of mechanical deformation of fractured rock  in previous papers [1, 2] we introduced a new approach for solving three-dimensional crack problems  the approach featured the following new elements:  • the use of complex variables to create various combinations of the fields, e g  in-plane components of tractions, displacement discontinuities, as well as geometric parameters • the use of triangular elements and analytical integration over those elements  • the use of the “limit after discretization” procedure, i e  enforcing the boundary conditions after the discretization and analytical handling of the internal fields   the approach was illustrated in [1] for a simple case of constant approximations of the unknowns  in [2], the method was further extended to include higher order approximations of unknowns  in addition, a new technique is employed to analytically evaluate the involved integrals  it is based on the reduction of the area boundary integrals over an element to those over its contour using complex integral representations  the technique allows for enrichment of the library of boundary elements by including those bounded by combination of straight lines and circular arcs | 
2015-223 	 modeling natural fracture network using object-based simulation |abstract  we implemented the object-based method using marked point processes to generate a natural fracture network honoring an assumed fracture characteristics’ distribution where the fractures are two-dimensional zero-thickness circular disks  fractures are divided into two groups based on their alignment which is acquired by monte carlo sampling from two gaussian distributions with 90-degree shift in the mean value; this hypothesis is validated considering the frequently observed checker-board fracture patterns in the outcrops  the growth of the fractures in the second group or the secondary (daughter) fractures can be terminated by a criterion derived from the distribution of the fractures in the first group or the primary (parent) fractures  for data assimilation purposes, a smooth seismic distribution for fracture density is mimicked by simple krigging which inherently possesses a smoothing nature  then, the generated seismic data is honored by revising the fracture distribution such that in areas with less fracture density we have fewer fractures  this work provides a novel, yet easy and fast workflow to stochastically model a natural fracture network following the attributes offered by seismic data and concludes an orthogonal or bidirectional fracture pattern  this pattern can be easily extended for multi-directional fracture patterns using the proposed framework   1  introduction|one of the big concerns in fractured reservoirs characterization is the representation of the subsurface fractures due to large uncertainty and extremely limited direct measurements pertaining to exact spatial distribution of fractures  stochastic approaches allow us to realize fractures discretely [1]  this approach embraces three different methods, object based simulation, hierarchical fracture modeling, and multiple point statistics based algorithms [1]  the current work concentrates on the first method  | 
2015-224 	 underground disposal of fine coal waste |abstract  the use of slurry impoundments has traditionally been the primary method of disposal of fine waste slurry resulting from the recovery of fine coal from coal preparation plants  however, disposal of coal waste has become challenging with stringent regulations for surface disposal facilities  the process of backfilling of mine void space is called slurry backfilling  this method would eliminate environmental, health, and safety risks associated with the surface disposal facilities such as impoundment failure due to ground motion, subsidence, etc  although slurry backfilling has significant advantages, it may raise some mine stability concerns  as the floor or pillars of the mine are exposed to moisture, they may soften and lose strength  in this study, the slurry backfilling effect on stability of two illinois underground coal mines is investigated  the mine floor consists of non-durable claystone material with various thicknesses  the geotechnical and geological information of the mine will be analyzed  the stability of these mines will be evaluated using empirical and numerical methods considering the softening of floor beds and pillars with slurry   1  introduction  based on the estimation of the illinois state geological survey, about 330,000 unit houses are exposed to the dangers of surface subsidence [1]  consequently, stability of mines has been one of the main concerns in illinois which should be professionally and practically addressed  the stability of mines deteriorates when exposed to moisture  on the other hand, due to more stringent environmental protection agency (epa) regulations slurry backfilling of mines as one of alternatives for disposing fine coal waste has attracted more attention  slurry backfilling consists of pumping coal fine refuse to abandoned space  slurry backfilling of coal waste can remove environmental, social, and health problems [2]  in light of many case studies by different researchers and committees such as griffith and connor [3], on different mines, hydraulic backfilling has been recommended  however, some studies show that slurry backfilling does not work well for all types of mines  for example, in the donovan study [4] this method has been recommended only for thin-seam coal mines | 
2015-225 	 modeling of failure behavior of anisotropic shale using lattice discrete particle model |abstract  shale, like many other sedimentary rocks, is typically heterogeneous and anisotropic with partial alignment of anisotropic clay minerals and naturally formed bedding planes  a numerical method based on the lattice discrete particle model was formulated  material anisotropy is introduced through an approximated geometric description of shale internal structure and a representation of material properties variation  calibration was performed by comparing the numerical simulation results with experimental data  a series of simulated experiments, including elastic analysis, brazilian tensile test and unconfined compression test, were demonstrated  simulation results shows that the dependence of tested strength and failure modes on sample orientation can be captured successfully  this work will pave the way for the development of reliable hydraulic fracturing models that appropriately account for the mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous and anisotropic shale    1  introduction  with the rapid growth of the shale gas/oil industry, especially the development of hydraulic fracturing technique, the study to promote deep understanding of the mechanical properties of shale-like rocks is becoming more important  gas/oil shale, described as organic rich and fine grained [1], exhibit significant mechanical anisotropy and heterogeneity due to the organized distribution of platy clay minerals and compliant organic materials [2]  developing adequate numerical models to capture the heterogeneity and anisotropy of shale leads to a better understanding of the influence of material properties on induced fracture initiation, propagation and fracturing treatment, and therefore provides a powerful tool to predict and optimize the fracturing process    in a broader sense, the available numerical methods can be classified into continuum- and discontinuum- based methods [3,4]  the continuum approaches, such as finite element method (fem), finite difference method (fdm) and boundary element method (bem), treats the computational domain as a single continuous body and captures material failure behaviors through common techniques such as plastic softening and damage models  as the lack of an internal length scale, the standard continuum approaches cannot capture localization of failure, and manifests itself in mesh sensitivity [3,5]  these shortcomings can be overcame by introducing micro-structural effects with second gradient damage models, non-local models [5] etc  on the contrary, the discontinuum approaches, represented by discrete element method (dem), treat the materials as an assembly of separate blocks or particles, and is capable of incorporating the length scale automatically  the methods of modeling material anisotropy are often classified into smeared approach and discrete approach [6]  the smeared approach utilizes a smeared representation in which the anisotropy is introduced at the level of constitutive laws by varying material parameters as a function of the relative orientation between elements and the bedding plane orientation [7]  the discrete approach utilizes a discrete representation in which the anisotropy is introduced by a geometric description of layers or joints with varying material parameters [6,8,9]  the discrete approach offers unique advantages when the extended loss of continuity inside the material makes continuum constitutive models inappropriate [6] | 
2015-228 	 gas transport characterization of fractured rock by in-situ gas-injection tests |abstract  the authors conducted the in-situ gas-tightness tests in a fractured rock at the namikata underground lpg storage construction site in ehime prefecture, japan  the test consisted of two independent setups, a gas-tightness test that used boreholes, and a chamber-scale test that used a horizontal drift sealed with a concrete plug  in each test, the gas pressure was increased up to the onset of the measurable gas flow to obtain the maximum containment pressure  this paper discusses the hydraulic conditions for gas leakage initiation and the importance of the pore pressure measurement for monitoring the gas-tightness of the lpg storage cavern based on the test results  the results of preliminary two-phase flow simulation study based on the in-situ test results are also presented    1  introduction  gas transport characteristics of fractured rocks is a great concern to variety of engineering applications such as underground storage of lpg, nuclear waste disposal, ccs and gas flooding in the oil field    besides absolute permeability, relative perme- ability and capillary pressure as a function of liquid phase saturation have direct influences to the results of two phase flow simulation  however, due to limited number of field tests, the applicability of the conventional two-phase flow functions, such as van genuchten model or linear model to fractured rocks are not well understood    the authors conducted the two types of in-situ tests, with different scales, a borehole gas-injection test and a chamber water/gas injection test in fractured granitic rock  the test area was developed at the underground lpg storage cavern construction site (kato et al , 2007) at namikata in ehime prefecture in japan (figure 1) | 
2015-229 	 numerical study of crack propagation and coalescence under quasi-static and dynamic loading by using the distinct lattice spring model |abstract  the dynamic behavior of crack propagation and coalescence in rock is investigated using the distinct lattice spring model (dlsm)  discontinuum based element model has been proven as a promising tool in the study of dynamic fracture in brittle materials like rock  as a newly developed tool, the distinct lattice spring model (dlsm), compared with classical discrete element model (dem), has advantages on computationally efficiency and being free of micro parameters calibration  this study further applies the dlsm to investigate the dynamic cracking and coalescence behavior in brittle material  first, central notched brazilian discs (cnbd) were simulated under loading  the results on crack pattern and coalescence are in good agreement with the experimental observations  the 3d examination of the evolution of the crack showed the crack growth in 3d was not as 2d observation, e g  crack propagation front is very irregular and failure might appear ahead of the crack tip  second, the simulations on a perforated plate blasting loading reveals that the crack pattern highly relays on the mode of heterogeneity  more specifically, the micro-structure of the material plays an important role on dynamic crack propagation and coalescence  at last, blasting effect on a 3d volume has also been investigated  this study can be useful to provide better understanding of the failure of rock under dynamic loading with discontinuity or heterogeneity    1  introduction  crack propagation and coalescence in rock is a popular research topic especially in underground excavation projects or slope stability problems in which the dynamic fracture phenomena are in dominance  to reduce the scale of the problem, different models are designed for experimental studies (e g  perforated thin plate model [1] and pre-notched disc model [2])  these models focus on the most important feature of the crack during fracturing by setting up specific specimen configuration or loading condition  with the development of the modern technology, numerical methods have been improved a lot  following the experimental model, numerical methods are applied on these models for validation or fundamental studies prior to applications on complicated project simulation | 
2015-231 	 constitutive couplings in unsaturated granular media with crushable grains |abstract  crushable granular materials exhibit a complex hydro-mechanical behavior  on the one hand, the hydraulic state alters the crushability of the solid matrix  on the other one, particle fragmentation causes major variations of grain and pore size distributions, thus impacting hydraulic properties such as permeability and water retention curve (wrc)  this paper addresses the continuum modeling of grain crushing in unsaturated sands within the framework of the breakage mechanics theory  this choice enables us to discuss the role of an evolving grain size distribution (gsd) on both mechanical and hydraulic properties  first, data available in the literature about the evolution of the wrc upon grain crushing are discussed, thus assessing the accuracy of the hypotheses about its evolution  then, the model is used to simulate various hydro-mechanical loading paths, showing that it is possible to capture a rich set of macroscopic couplings associated with either high-pressure compression or wetting  finally, the model is used to investigate the grainsize dependency of these coupling effects  physical considerations at the micro-scale are used to elucidate the effect of grain breakage on the predicted coupling terms, setting a vision for the future application of this modeling approach also to other classes of geomaterials, such as rockfill and granular rocks    1  introduction  grain crushing is involved in a variety of geomechanics applications, from energy technology to natural hazards [1-4]  field and laboratory evidences show that the fluctuation of the hydraulic state tends to cause particle breakage [5-7]  the hydrologic properties also evolve significantly as a result of fragmentation [8]  hence, mechanical and hydraulic processes in crushable media involve two-way constitutive couplings and require specific theoretical and computational treatment    breakage mechanics [9] is a theoretical framework that, by means of an internal variable related with the gsd, is able to capture the microstructural changes arising upon crushing  by linking this approach to the capillary theory, it has been possible to predict the coupling between the degree of saturation and the yielding of a wet assembly [10]  such approach has also been used to predict the size dependency of the crushing stress of unsaturated sands [11], as well as the coupling terms required to model their incremental hydro-mechanical response [12]  this paper builds on these findings and focuses on the assessment of the crushing-dependence of the wrc, as well as on its impact on the evolution of the macroscopic properties measured during loading and/or wetting paths  | 
2015-232 	 modelling the shear behaviour of sedimentary rock joints under constant normal stiffness conditions |abstract  the typical shear behaviour of rock joints has been studied under a constant normal load (cnl) or zero normal stiffness condition, but recent studies have shown that this boundary condition may not replicate more practical situations, and that constant normal stiffness (cns) is a more appropriate boundary condition to describe the stress-strain response of field joints  in addition to the effect of boundary conditions, the shear behaviour of a rough joint also depends on its surface properties and the initial stress acting on its interface  despite this, exactly how these parameters affect the shear behaviour of joints is not fully understood because the stress-strain response of joints is governed by non-uniform asperity damage and the resulting gouge that accumulates on their interfaces  therefore, an attempt has been made in this study to predict the complete shear behaviour of rough joints incorporating the asperity deformation under cns conditions  in order to validate this analytical model, a series of cns shear tests were conducted on rough tensile (natural) joints and their replicas at a range of initial normal stresses that varied from 0 4 to 1 6 mpa  comparisons between the predicted shear behaviour and the experimental results show close agreement    1  introduction  an appropriate evaluation of the shear behaviour of rock joints is vital, for instance when analysing the stability of rock slopes, designing excavations in jointed rock, assessing the stability of concrete dam foundations, and designing rock socked piles  in conventional studies, the shear behaviour of a joint is usually investigated in the laboratory under constant normal load (cnl) boundary conditions where the normal stress remains constant and the surface of the joint dilates freely during shearing  however in engineering practice, the normal stress acting on the joint interface may vary during shearing, and the joint dilation may be constrained by the confined environment formed across the interface  this often represents a constant normal stiffness (cns) condition  the practical implications of this are movements of unstable blocks in the roof or walls of an underground excavation, reinforced rock wedges sliding in a rock slope or foundation, and the vertical movement of rock-socketed concrete piles  several researchers have emphasised the fact that a constant normal stiffness (cns) boundary condition is more appropriate for many field situations [1-7] | 
2015-235 	 nonlinear failure mechanism and dynamic simulation of the deep rock engineering |abstract  due to the high geo-stress state of the surrounding rock mass in deep rock engineering, which attends to induce large deformation, rock burst, zonal disintegration and other disasters, the traditional theories of statics continuum rock mechanics cannot explain many problems in the deep rock engineering sufficiently  this article presents a new dynamic constitutive model in the view of dynamic failure, considering the release, dissipation and transfer of energy under the unloading of deep rock mass, during which process the volume deformation experience elastic resilience and volumetric dilatation, and the shearing deformation may experience pre-peak (elastic and internal frictional hardening stages) and post-peak (softening and residual failure stages) stages  this model also describes the relationship of the elastic resilience and volumetric dilatation with time, which establish the volume deformation constitutive model  and fracture lag time and failure time are employed to establish the rheological equation and strength evolution equation  with this model three numerical simulations had been carried out in different deep rock engineering to represent phenomenon and analysis mechanism of large deformation, rock burst and zonal disintegration   1  introduction  with the stable development of the economy and national defense, underground engineering tends to be constructed at the deep rock mass, such as thousands meter depth mining tunnels(niechuan coal mine in china and gold mine in south africa), seepage tunnels at hydropower station, nuclear wastes storages and deep national defense facilities(north american aerospace defense command)  new characteristic and scientific phenomena have been found in the deep rock engineering, which have many differences to the shadow underground engineering  the main differences of the deep rock environment to shallow depth are high geostress, high temperature, high osmotic pressure and large turbulence caused by excavation [1]  therefore, the traditional theories of statics continuum rock mechanics cannot explain those problems in the deep rock engineering sufficiently [2,3]  | 
2015-236 	 a creep constitutive model considering geometric damage of fractured rock mass and its application |abstract  more and more large-scale underground power houses are under complex geological environment of great buried depth and high in-situ stress  meanwhile, it is complicated to analyze the long-term stability of underground caverns owing to the existence of joints in the surrounding rock mass  the joints make the degradation effect of the surrounding rock mass  according to these features, a new visco-elasto-plastic constitutive model is proposed  the model has a comprehensive consideration of geometric damage of the fractured rock mass  besides, regarding vc++ as a terrace, we use the secondary development function of flac3d to make a program of this constitutive model  it is a dynamic link library (dll) and it can be used by the main program of flac3d  the new damage creep model of fractured rock mass is developed  in the project of jinping i underground power houses in sichuan, china, we use this program to analyze the long-term stability of underground caverns and guide the design of engineering  the results show that: it is quite strong feasible to use this new damage creep model to simulate the excavation of large underground caverns and analyze the long-term stability, and the analysis results can be used to guide the construction of engineering    1  introduction  complex, jointed rock masses are commonly encountered in both underground excavation and slope stability engineering  the strength, deformation and time-dependent characteristics of rock masses directly affect the stability measures and reinforcement requirements for engineering design, construction, and maintenance of these rock structures  thus it is essential, that the effect of joints be considered in the estimation of the rheological properties of the rock mass  as most of the related large-scale hydropower projects are located in the deep, narrow valleys of south west china, their underground caverns are usually subjected to very high in-situ stresses strongly influenced by the topography  under these circumstances, brittle rock failure and associated time effects often occur during cavern excavation and construction  concomitantly, splitting failure which adversely affects stability has been experienced in side walls and other parts of these underground hydropower station caverns  | 
2015-237 	 experimental investigation of cement to rock bonding |abstract  fundamental testing of cement-to-formation bonding under stress is needed to provide better input to models quantifying the risk of debonding as a function of evolving stress conditions  this is particularly important for long term co2 sequestration, where sealing of the injection wells has to last for centuries and where stresses are probably going to evolve with time  a new experimental technique is here proposed, whereby composite rock/cement plugs are created under stress and temperature  different interface angles permit testing the interface shear strength and friction angle under unconfined compression  direct tension tests are also performed in order to get insight on tensile bond strength  results so far show that even for competent berea sandstone, tensile failure seems preferentially to occur in the rock part and not at the interface nor in the cement part of the tested plug  similarly, in unconfined compression, failure seems to occur primarily in the sandstone part of the plug    1  introduction  recent work has identified the well cement-to-rock interface as the weakest link, when it comes to leakage from wells [1, 2]  this leakage occurs for many older production wells, not necessarily from the target production reservoir, but often from higher, pressurized permeable layers [3]  several experimental techniques have been used to investigate cement integrity: ring geometry under hpht conditions [4], "dog bone" geometry cement specimens in direct uniaxial tensile tests [5], unconfined compression testing in a load frame equipped with axial and radial strain gauges to assess unconfined compressive strength (ucs) and elastic parameters [6] on a cement cylindrical specimen, cement bond shear strength testing where cement is pushed out of a rock borehole while measuring the applied force on the cement [7], direct shear testing (of concrete) in shear box [8], pure shear testing in load frame with modified, split anvils whereby only half of the tested specimen is compresses, as well as triaxial testing of concentric cylindrical specimens including casing, cement and rock [9]  | 
2015-239 	 ae-rate controlled mode ii fracture propagation experiments on granite and sandstone |abstract  we studied the initiation and propagation of mode ii fractures in granite and sandstone under confining pressure to investigate the controls on shear fracture propagation in rocks  an asymmetric loading set up was used to induce a fracture in cylindrical rock samples under confining pressure between 0-20 mpa  we achieved quasi-static fracture propagation with a refined ae feedback displacement control  this technique prolongs the fracturing process up to 42 hours, provides a higher ae resolution and thereby allowed the distinction of two different stages in shear fracture propagation  granitic samples form vertical fractures in the strain strengthening stage that branch and stop propagating at peak stress  simultaneously at peak stress a distinct diagonal fracture nucleates on the loaded side of the vertical fracture  during strain weakening we observed stable growth of this second diagonal fracture until the sample lost its integrity  on the other hand sandstone samples only form the diagonal fracture during the strain weakening stage  analysis of ae source type and hypocenter as well as microstructural analysis indicate that porosity, either intrinsic (sandstone) or deformation inflicted (granite), primarily influences this fracture nucleation and propagation behavior for both rock types    1  introduction  fractures form as microscopic cracks coalesce into a planar structure, which can be captured by monitoring acoustic emissions (aes)  macroscopically, rocks will fracture in the mode (i or ii) corresponding to the mode of loading determined by the orientation of the fracture relative to the stress state  however at a microscopic scale, both modes of fracturing can be found in what may appear to be a pure mode of fracturing at the macroscopic scale [1, 2]  according to the acoustic emissions observed during rock fracturing experiments, shear-, tensile-, and compression-events all occur during macroscopic mode ii fracture propagation [3]  on a microscopic scale on the other hand, increased confining pressure suppresses the occurrence of mode i fractures and supports the occurrence of mode ii fractures [4]  these observations demonstrate the complexity of rock fracturing on a microscopic scale and thereby raised a controversy about the validity of macroscopic fracture modes  the existence of a fracture criterion for mode ii is still debated in the literature [5, 6]  to study this, many authors used acoustic emissions to stabilize the fracture process [1, 7, 8, 9, 10]  by controlling the load in response to the intensity of the observed aes, the rate of fracturing was varied and fracture propagation could be visualized in detail  | 
2015-240 	 ground control in china's coal mine: progress and prospects |abstract  china is the world's largest coal-producing country and its coal production was 3 57 billion ton in 2014, of which underground longwall mining accounts for more than 85%  china has achieved great progress in ground control of underground mining  many theories are well applied to coal mining, such as the “voussoir beam” theory for analyzing the roof breaking law and shield support capacity, the “key strata” theory for controlling the surface subsidence, the dynamic load theory for determining supports capacity in large-cutting-height mining and top-coal caving mining and the coal wall shear failure theory for high strength mining  the maximum capacity of self-developed two-leg and four-leg shield support reaches 21000kn, which realized the strata control of working face in large-scale mining  the backfilling mining technique for controlling surface subsidence is basically mature  strengthen the research on ground control theory of extremely-thick coal seam mining, gob-side entry retaining technique in top-coal caving mining, multiple coal seams mining and deep coal seam mining are the main directions of future development of ground control theory and technique in china's coal mine   1  introduction  since 2010, china has become the largest energy consumption country in the world with a total of 38 52 billion tons, accounting for 22 4% of the world's total energy consumption  coal accounts for 76% of energy consumption in china [1]  china’s coal production reached 3 66 billion tons in 2013, however, it decreased by 2 5 percent in 2014 than the amount in 2013, which is the first negative growth of china's coal production since 2000  nevertheless, china's coal production accounts for about 48 percent of world coal production, of which 85 percent comes from underground mining, so underground mining plays an important role in china  nowadays fully mechanized longwall mining has become the main method for underground coal mining in china, but there are some differences on the specific mining method because of the influence of coal seam thickness, inclination and many other factors | 
2015-241 	 calculating the potential for coal pillar bumps using a local mine stiffness criterion |abstract  coal mine bumps are a serious safety problem in coal mines and they are very hard to predict due to the poor understanding of the exact mechanics of this dynamic failure phenomena  however, previous research has demonstrated that the local mine stiffness (lms) criterion is a promising approach for analyzing the possibility of violent pillar failure  typically, the local mine stiffness calculation quantifies the loading stiffness of the surrounding rock mass and compares that to the stiffness of the support pillars in the post-failure range in order to determine if a pillar failure in the mine will occur in a stable or un-stable manner  if the loading stiffness is softer than the support stiffness, a dynamic failure can occur  with this knowledge ahead of time, mine engineers can modify the geometries and pillar sizes in the mine design to help eliminate violent pillar failure   in this paper, the principles of the lms criterion for evaluating stable versus unstable failure are reviewed  then the mathematical techniques used to implement a lms calculation into lamodel are presented  next, a simple idealized model is used to demonstrate and quantify the effects of rock mass stiffness and mine geometry on the lms calculated by lamodel  then, an actual coal mine, pillar bump accident is back analyzed with the lamodel code with the recently implemented local mine stiffness calculation  the numerical model was initially calibrated to thoroughly match the observed mine failure, and then the local mine stiffness and post-failure pillar stiffness were calculated and compared  in this mine model, the mine stiffness steadily decreased to eventually match the pillar stiffness at the time of the observed violent failure  this case study demonstrated that the local mine stiffness criteria can be successfully calculated and applied, but the accuracy of the calculation is very dependent on accurate rock mass and pillar properties    1  overview   pillar bumps are a longstanding ground control problem associated with coal mining  this kind of pillar failure has presented serious safety problems in the united states throughout the 20th century [1, 2]  in order to attack the problem of bumps, the local mine stiffness stability criterion has been recognized as a reasonable analysis approach and it provides a means to distinguish if the pillar will fail in a stable or unstable manner [3, 4]    although this theoretical criterion has been well established for a long time, there are still significant gaps in our ability to accurately evaluate the stability of pillars with it due to the challenges of accurately determining the post-failure pillar stiffness and the local mine stiffness in a mining layout [2] | 
2015-244 	 the effect of poroelastic stress changes on the triggering front of induced seismicity during fluid injection |abstract  in this contribution, we analyze in detail the spatio-temporal changes of the stress field caused by fluid injection and their effects on injection induced seismicity  we use linear superpositions to model a cylindrical injection source in a three dimensional poroelastic medium of infinite extent that mimics an open borehole section rather than a single point source  the influence on induced seismicity is monitored via changes in the coulomb failure function  previous theoretical and numerical studies indicate that injection induced stresses have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect depending on relative position with respect to injection point and principal stress directions prior to injection  consequently the shape of seismic event clouds is affected by pore pressure diffusion and induced stresses    our results indicate that poroelastic induced stress has a direct impact on the triggering front of seismicity  in particular during shut-in we find a significantly different position of the triggering front compared to predictions from pore pressure diffusion models  the calculated three dimensional seismic event clouds are in good agreement with field observations   our findings emphasize the importance of poroelastic stress changes in addition to pore pressure diffusion effects in describing and analyzing injection induced seismicity   1  overview   traditional analysis of injection-induced seismicity assumes pore pressure diffusion to be the main triggering mechanism [1,2]  recent contributions however also emphasize the importance of induced poroelastic stress for the spatial evolution of the triggering front  schoenball [3] investigated the influence of poroelastic stress compared to anisotropic diffusivity  the authors used a two-dimensional numerical model and found that either mechanism results in similar elongated microseismic clouds, rendering the two effects indistinguishable  altmann [4] extended the analysis to three dimensions and concluded that fault reactivation is promoted along the maximum principal stress direction through poroelastic stress contribution  field studies indeed reveal that seismic event clouds may be elongated along the maximum principal stress direction [5,6,7] | 
2015-245 	 monitoring of mechanically-induced damage in rock using transmission and reflection elastic waves |abstract  crack initiation, propagation and coalescence, from pre-cracked rock specimens, were detected in the laboratory using elastic wave transmission and reflection signals  the experiments were conducted on prismatic indiana limestone specimens with two parallel pre-existing flaws subjected to uniaxial compression  digital image correlation was used to monitor the cracking process around the tips of the flaws by imaging surface displacements  compressional and shear wave pulses were transmitted and reflected continuously through the specimen while the uniaxial compressive load increased  the normalized amplitude of transmitted waves (shear waves with horizontal polarization) was observed to decrease with increasing uniaxial load, which was associated with the elastic deformations of the specimen  however, prior to tensile crack initiation, a large reduction in amplitude occurred  in addition, an additional decrease in amplitude was observed close to crack coalescence  these changes in amplitude occurred at least 1 3 mpa before the detection of damage by dic imaging  the normalized amplitude of reflected signals (from the flaw tips) also increased significantly before the initiation of new cracks  these experimental results indicate that changes in transmitted and reflected seismic waves provide a potential method to detect crack initiation inside rock, as well as to determine the location of new cracks   1  overview   a large number of experimental studies have been conducted on crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence in pre-cracked brittle materials  in most of these studies, the pre-existing crack (flaw) has been subjected to mixed mode loading (mode i: opening or tensile and mode ii: in plane shear) [1–11]  two types of cracks have been observed in these experiments: tensile (wing) and shear (secondary) cracks, which are shown in fig  1  tensile cracks initiate at or near the tip of the flaw  they propagate toward the direction of maximum compression and they are stable (i e  further propagation of these cracks require application of additional load)  these cracks are also characterized by a plumose structure on their surface  shear cracks initiate from the tips of the flaws, they are initially stable, but they may be unstable close to crack coalescence or specimen failure  these cracks have been classified into two groups: coplanar or quasi-coplanar (making an angle of 45° or less with the flaw plane) and oblique (with an initiation angle larger than 45° with the flaw plane)  the shear cracks are formed in areas of high compression and/or shear stress  they are characterized by pulverized material on the surface and by high roughness [12]  park and bobet [12] performed laboratory uniaxial compression tests on gypsum specimens with two, three, and 16 parallel flaws  they identified eight types of coalescence based on different flaw geometries (see table 1 in [12])  observations in the laboratory have relied on visual inspection using optical magnification and high-speed cameras  while these techniques have been instrumental in the understanding of cracking phenomena at the macroscopic scale, what is needed, is a local or microscopic characterization of new cracks forming inside the brittle materials | 
2015-246 	 sand production delay in gas flow experiments |abstract  sand production in gas reservoirs is often associated with severe erosion of topside installations, due to high velocity impact of sand grains on tubing bends and choke restrictions  dedicated laboratory testing on various field and outcrop sandstone specimens surprisingly show that sand production onset is delayed relative to oil or brine flow through the same rocks  this delay is observed even when care is taken to match the drag force on the sand grains to that observed in tests with liquid flow  one proposed explanation is that desiccation of the sandstone occurs, due to the expansion of the gas as it emerges into the borehole; drying of many sandstones is accompanied with an increase in strength, which may be responsible for the observed sand onset delay  another hypothesis is that non-linear gas flow in the porous rock results in losses due to acceleration and deceleration from pore to pore, such that only part of the flow energy is translated into drag force on the grains  careful analysis of the laboratory tests seems to confirm the latter hypothesis    1  introduction  gas reservoirs are often produced with high rates in wells and topside pipes [1]  for weak sandstone formations, this entails the risk that any sand particles co-produced with the gas also have high velocities  such high velocity sand grains cause extensive erosion damage, especially in bends and when passing through choke restrictions [2]  this erosion propensity explains the widespread practice in the oil and gas industry of restricting gas production rates so as to avoid any risk of sand production  on the other hand, accurate prediction of the conditions for sand onset, in terms of allowable drawdown to the wells and depletion of in-situ pressure in the reservoir, is vital in order to preserve the economic interests, i e  maximizing fluid productivity  even if no sand management approach is adopted [3], a closer investigation of sand rate evolution after sand onset is still needed, so as to better quantify the needed safety factor when designing well production throughout expected operation lifetime  | 
2015-247 	 probabilistic analysis of rock slopes involving correlated non-normal variables using point estimate methods |abstract  present study investigates applicability, superiorities and impediments of point estimate methods (pem) in probabilistic stability analysis of rock slopes  a rock slope which involves correlated non-normally distributed variables, is considered and probabilistic analyses are carried out incorporating four different pems with numerical method  it is illustrated that correlation and asymmetry in random variables can be treated in different ways by using different pems  some methods like rosenblueth’s or zhou & nowak’s pems are originally applicable for correlated skewed random parameters while deficiencies of harr’s and hong’s pems arise when random variables are non-normally distributed and correlated, respectively  it is shown that how can manipulate these two methods in order to make them usable for correlated non-normal variables   1  introduction  having considered the recent works which have been done by [1-9] in recent two decades, it can be said that probabilistic analyses are increasingly becoming popular in geotechnical engineering in order to take uncertainties into account where stability of geotechnical structures are investigated  when these analyses are performed using numerical methods, it is vital to select an appropriate probabilistic tool that not only can readily be incorporated with numerical method, but also makes the analyses efficient  monte carlo simulation (mcs) [10], reliability methods and point estimate method (pem) [11] are some probabilistic tools which are widely used in geotechnical engineering  in case that model evaluation is time consuming, mcs is infeasible because small number of simulations leads to inaccurate results and on the other hand, large number of simulations leads to inefficiency  form [12] and sorm [13] need to calculate derivatives of performance function with respect to random parameters; as a result, these methods may not easily be combined with numerical methods  under such circumstances, pems often constitute more practical alternatives as they require smaller amount of computations along with statistical moments for inputs only  in this research, the applicability of pems in analyzing the stability of a rock slope probabilistically, is investigated  | 
2015-248 	 integrated experimental and computational study of hydraulic fracturing and the use of alternative fracking fluids |abstract  shale gas is an unconventional fossil energy resource that is already having a profound impact on us energy independence and is projected to last for at least 100 years  production of methane and other hydrocarbons from low permeability shale involves hydrofracturing of rock, establishing fracture connectivity, and multiphase fluid-flow and reaction processes all of which are poorly understood  the result is inefficient extraction with many environmental concerns  this work uses innovative high-pressure microfluidic and triaxial core flood experiments on shale to explore fracture-permeability relations and the extraction of hydrocarbon  these data are integrated with simulations including lattice boltzmann modeling of pore-scale processes, finiteelement/ discrete element models of fracture development in the near-well environment, and discrete-fracture network modeling of the reservoir  the ultimate goal is to make the necessary measurements to develop models that can be used to determine the reservoir operating conditions necessary to gain a degree of control over fracture generation and fluid flow   1  introduction  shale gas is an unconventional fossil energy resource that is already having a profound impact on us energy sector, with reserves projected to last for nearly 100 years [1]  the increased availability of shale gas (i e , methane), which produces 50% less co2 than coal, is primarily responsible for us emissions in 2011 dropping to their lowest levels in 20 years [2]  production of methane and other hydrocarbons from low permeability shale involves hydrofracturing of rock, establishing fracture connectivity, and multiphase fluid-flow and reaction processes, all of which are poorly understood  the result is inefficient extraction with many environmental concerns [3,4]  industry is motivated to reduce the 70 to 140 billion gallon per year water demand because there are droughts in the west, a lack of deep injection wells in the east, and possible forthcoming regulations [3]  our goal is to use unique los alamos national laboratory (lanl) microfluidic and triaxial core flood experiments integrated with stateof- the-art numerical simulation to reveal the fundamental dynamics of fracture-fluid interactions to transform fracking from an ad hoc tool to a safe and predictable approach based on solid scientific understanding  the goal is to develop co2-based fracturing fluids and fracturing techniques to enhance production, reduce waste-water, while simultaneously sequestering co2 [4]  | 
2015-249 	 3d modeling of hydraulic fracturing and stress perturbations during fluid injection |abstract  hydraulic fracture growth is simulated in homogeneous granite with a fully coupled hydromechanical discreteelement method  three models are considered, namely an intact rock and two models with pre-existing fractures, connected or disconnected to the incipient hydraulic fracture plane  in all scenarios, the hydraulic fracture grows in a plane with a mostly circular front, despite anisotropic stresses  in the intact rock and disconnected models a hydraulic fracture propagates normal to the minimum principal stress, whereas in the connected fracture model fluid leaks into a pre-existing low dipping fracture set  the length of the hydraulic fracture increases with the square root of time and the maximum aperture is linearly correlated to the length of the fracture, except for the connected fracture model, where the aperture is limited and mostly constant over time  these results demonstrate the important role pre-existing natural fractures can have on hydraulic fracture growth  stress perturbation due to the developing hydraulic fracture promotes fracturing at the fracture tip but inhibits failure in the fracture walls  in the connected fracture model these stress perturbations are significantly reduced, due to fluids moving into the natural fractures    1  introduction|hydraulic fractures are fluid-induced and connected hydraulically to the injection well  they form a more or less complex geometry with an architecture ranging from a simple planar structure to a complex fractured zone [3, 4, 5, 6]  the volume of the hydraulic fractures commonly increases over the course of the fluid injection indicating fracture propagation and linkage [7]  hydraulic fractures commonly grow normal to the minimal principal stress [8, 9]  it is therefore interpreted as resulting of tensile opening due to increased pore pressure at fracture tips and in the fracture volume [10, 11, 12]  however, evidence of shearing has also been highlighted [3, 8, 13, 14]  | 
2015-253 	 numerical modeling of experimental hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation in enhanced geothermal systems |abstract  the paper presents numerical modeling of experimental scale study of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation for creation of enhanced geothermal systems  the displacement discontinuity method, which is a variant of the boundary element method, is used to model the rock matrix deformation and stress distribution around the fracture surface  parabolic crack tip elements are used to account for square root variation of the fracture front displacement and stresses  newtonian fracturing fluid flow is modeled using the standard galerkin’s finite element method  the fracture initiation and propagation process are addressed following the linear elastic fracture mechanics  the hydraulic fracture simulation process presents a complex numerical problem in which physical processes involved such as rock matrix deformation, fracture fluid flow, and fracture propagation are interdependent  the fracture aperture strongly influences the fluid flow behavior inside the fracture, as the fluid velocity is a function of the fracture aperture, and the fluid pressure influences rock deformation process  hence, these processes of the fluid flow, the fracture deformation, and the fracture propagation are solved in a coupled manner using sequential iterative approach till the convergence is achieved  first, details of the mathematical model and methodology are presented  the model is then tested against some known analytical and semi-analytical solutions  finally, the hydraulic fracturing results from a true triaxial egs experimental cell developed at colorado school of mines are used to validate numerical model results    1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is considered the primary means of creating functional geothermal reservoirs at sites where the permeability of rock is too limited to allow cost effective heat recovery  the natural and hydraulically created fractures provide conductive paths to the stored hydrocarbons or thermal energy in the reservoir rocks to the wellbore thereby increasing the production rates  stimulation technology and methodology as used in the oil and gas industry for sedimentary formations are well developed; however, they have not sufficiently been demonstrated for the enhanced geothermal systems (egs) reservoir creation  insufficient data and measurements under geothermal conditions make it difficult to directly translate experience from the oil and gas industries to egs applications  creation of the egs reservoirs requires an improved fracturing methodology, rheologically controllable fracturing fluids, and temperature hardened proppants  | 
2015-254 	 contribution of shear slip in a widespread compressive pillar failure |abstract  a release of energy occurs during mining-related seismic events such as rock bursts and coal bumps  the magnitude of these events depends partly upon the energy made available by the loading system and partly upon the post-peak softening behavior of the failing medium  in addition, the extent of unstable failure and associated release of energy can be affected by slip along interfaces between dissimilar materials  this paper compares the results of two numerical models from the back analysis of a coal mine collapse which resulted in a 3 9 local magnitude seismic event  release of kinetic energy is considered in the simulations, which were run using a 2d distinct element software package  the model inputs differ in that the interfaces between the coal and the surrounding rock are defined either through coulomb slip joint parameters or continuously yielding (displacement-softening) joint parameters  the geometry, loading conditions, and mining sequence are otherwise identical  the coal is modeled as a strain-softening material, while the roof and floor are modeled as continuous elastic blocks  the failure response and magnitude of released energy are compared between the two models  the results of the analysis indicate that the softening coal/rock interface facilitates the collapse of large width-to-height ratio pillars and leads to a release of energy more than one order of magnitude higher than the alternative coal-rock interface   1  introduction  the unstable failure of coal pillars, especially those with large width-to-height (w/h) ratios, involves a great deal of complexity  although large w/h pillars exhibit hardening behavior under loading and are prone to fail gradually, the combination of certain loading conditions and geologic properties can result in sudden collapse  the nature and extent of such failures depends on many factors, including the geometry of the mine and the presence of stiff overlying strata  another factor that has a significant effect on the behavior of the pillars is the strength, or rather weakness, of the interface between the coal and the host rock  there is little data available regarding the properties of coal/rock interfaces, but a number of studies have been conducted to better understand the effect that they have on pillar strength [1], [2], [3], and [4]  this paper presents the results of two mine-scale numerical models in which a pillar retreat mine fails unstably, and although the modeling procedures are identical in each simulation, the application of different coal/rock interface parameters results in a different progression and magnitude of failure |

2015-257 	 case study: understanding the mechanics behind the rockmass deformation observed in an extraction strike drive at new gold’s new afton mine block cave operation |abstract  new gold’s new afton mine (“new afton”) is a 5 million tonne per year operating block cave mine located 8km outside of kamloops, british columbia, canada  the current extraction level is at 615m below surface and the current mining footprint is approximately 800m in length by 120m in width  at its current size, new afton is one of the smallest producing block caving operations in the world  the ore being mined is a copper-gold porphyry deposit situated within the iron mask batholith complex, is bounded by 2 major fault structures and dips near vertically to the south-southeast and plunges southwest  the bulk of the economically viable portion of the deposit is highly jointed and rockmass quality is in the order of 35 - 55 (rmr76, bieniawski), placing it in a poor to fair classification category  the case study presented here focuses on a single strike drive (“g”) located on the southern abutment of the cave  an excavation that has been subjected to numerous rehabilitation operations and campaigns since caving started early in 2012    1  introduction  the new afton mine completed its first drawbell in september 2011  this was after ~17,700 metres of decline access, infrastructure and footprint development  the operation decided on the “el-teniente” extraction leve l layout of straight-through drawpoint drives, a decision largely made on geotechnical and operational considerations  employing an advanced undercut method, a fairly aggressive drawbell development and construction schedule was planned and achieved to establish the initial design hydraulic radius to promote steady state caving  this caving strategy allowed the operation to install a number of convergence monitoring stations throughout the entire advanced strike drive development ahead of the cave  this important aspect provided us the ability to monitor ground movement very early on and track progression of rockmass deformation and changes as the cave matured | 
2015-258 	 lattice bond cell modeling of dynamic hydraulic fracture |abstract  the lattice bond cell (lbc) is a newly developed lattice model for dynamic fracture simulation  it represents a rock with a discrete structure composed of lattice bond cells  each lattice bond cell can take any geometry with any number of bonds  the interactions between particles in a cell are characterized by an interatomic potential  in this study, the lbc is used to simulate dynamic hydraulic fracture  a special technique is developed to impose fluid pressure to fracture faces  the simulation examples suggest that the lbc can simulate the initiation, propagation and branching behaviors of fracture driven by the internal high fluid pressure without any separate fracture criterion  the fracture branching behavior is analyzed  the branching degree of hydraulic fracture is governed by the fluid pressure level while the branched fracture growth direction is governed by the ratio of in-situ stress  it is suggested that the lbc is a feasible approach to simulating dynamic hydraulic fracture   1  introduction  hydraulic fracture (hf) is an important technique to stimulate oil production in the unconventional reservoir  so far many methods have been developed to simulate hf process  however, most of them focus on the quasistatic hf while few on the dynamic ones  in reality, some hydraulic fractures branch due to the internal high fluid pressure  branching is a kind of unstable fracture response to rapid loading  it cannot be captured by the static simulation method  hence, it is necessary to develop an effective method to simulate the dynamic hf  the dynamic hf is different from the usual dynamic fracture in that it is driven by the internal fluid pressure  the pressure boundary condition varies as the fracture develops  thus, the dynamic hf behavior becomes more complicated  in the dynamic fracture simulation, the discrete element method presents obvious advantages over the continuous one  it has been extensively used to simulate the quasi-static hf, e g  torres and castano [1] and marina et al [2], but few to the dynamic hf  recently, zhang[3] has developed a lattice bond cell method to model the continuum  this lattice bond cell method is different from the conventional lattice method in that its discrete structure is composed of lattice bond cells  each lattice bond cell can take any geometry and can have any number of bonds  a hyperelastic interatomic potential is introduced to describe the interactions between particles  this makes the lattice bond cell method quite suitable to simulate the dynamic fracture for the hyperelasticity governs the instability of dynamic fracture[4, 5]  in this paper, the lattice bond cell model is used to simulate the dynamic hf  due to the complicated variable pressure boundary condition, the fracture direction is subjected to many factors  da silva and einstein[6] have studied the fracture initiation and possible propagation direction of hf under quasi-static load  zhang and chen[7] suggests that the dynamic re- hf always tends to develop along the maximum in-situ stress direction  but in these researches, no dynamic fracture branching behavior is involved  if the hf is subjected to the dynamic fluid pressure, the fracture propagation direction becomes more complicated  the dynamic hf simulation becomes especially important to determine the hf direction  |

2015-262 	 geomecanical modeling in co2 enhanced oil recovery |abstract  the bakken formation is an extremely tight formation with low porosity and permeability  activity in developing such an unconventional play has increased due to the success of horizontal drilling coupled with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing stimulation  however, due to high capillary trapping the primary recovery factor in the bakken remains rather low  therefore, small improvements in productivity of bakken wells by applying enhanced oil recovery could increase the recoverable oil by billions of barrels  among several eor options, co2 flooding may be effective to increase the recovery factor  in this paper, numerical simulation is used to evaluate the performance of co2–eor for the bakken formation  there is also a strong interest in coupling reservoir fluid flow with geomechanics to study the stress and deformation of reservoir rock thoroughly  in this work we used coupled code to study the interactions between reservoir flow and geomechanics to model the deformations and stresses in a co2-eor process   1  introduction  gas injection is an effective enhanced oil recovery method in naturally fractured or hydraulically fractured tight formations  recent studies showed that co2-eor could be a viable method to increase recovery in tight shale plays  the bakken reservoir of williston basin is one of such tight plays composed of an upper shale member, a middle member of sandstone and siltstone, and a lower shale member  activity in developing the bakken formation has increased due to the success of horizontal drilling coupled with multistage hydraulic fracturing stimulation [1]  however, maintaining production— which may be acquired by hydraulic fracturing and well stimulation— is quite challenging for this type of wells  hence, the primary recovery factor in the bakken fm remains very low estimated less than 10% of the original oil in place [2- 5] | 
2015-268 	 brittleness determination of rock using rock physics techniques calibrated with macro damage |abstract  rock brittleness is an indicator to characterize the intensity of failure, widely used in shale hydraulic fracturing for reservoir stimulation and tunnel construction  representative measurement approaches of brittleness are reviewed  a brittleness determination method comprised of rock physics techniques and mechanical tests is proposed for dry samples of shale, sand, limestone and concrete  the samples are tested with ultrasonic pulse under hydrostatic pressure  triaxial tests of samples are carried out under various confining pressure with constant temperature, recording stress-strain relations and ae (acoustic emission) signals originated from macro rock damage  the sem (scanning electron microscope) image of failure shale samples show cracks of brittle failure in rock matrix under test load  the method for brittleness determination is presented with comprehensive consideration of pre-peak damage and post-peak strength release rate based on stress-strain relationship  it appears that the method, which revealed intrinsic brittleness of intact samples and failure under artificial load, appropriately characterizes brittle behavior of rock with matrix damage  the brittleness is independent of mineral composition alone  shale samples are far more brittle than other samples used for tests  the shale and sand samples in various confining pressure show more brittle behavior in moderate confining pressure    1  introduction  rock brittleness is an indicator to characterize the intensity of failure, widely used in unconventional reservoir hydraulic fracturing for stimulation consideration  however, even up to now the definition of brittleness varies from authors to authors and areas to areas [1-8]  at present, it’s widely accepted that the pursuit for one universal brittleness determination method is laborious and fruitless, as specific assessment methods are required to serve in sorts of practice  | 
2015-274 	 numerical simulations on the motions of supercritical carbon dioxide jet and its abrasive particle |abstract  supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-co2) jet can break rocks with higher rates and lower threshold pressures than water jet due to the unique fluid properties  the abrasive sc-co2 jet technique, which is formed by adding abrasive particles to the sc-co2 jet, was proposed and studied  it is expected to achieve better cutting performance than water jet and sc-co2 jet  considering the low fluid viscosity, whether the sc-co2 jet has satisfactory particle carrying capacity has to be determined  in effort to investigate the motion of the abrasive particle and the feasibility of abrasive sc-co2 jet, numerical simulations on the flow field of the jet under different ambient conditions were carried out, as well as the comparisons with another three particle-laden jets  the results show that sc-co2 jet has better particle carrying capacity than the other three fluids  moreover, temperature rise slightly impairs the capacity meanwhile both the fluid and particle velocities increase, exerting better impinging effect of the abrasive jet  besides, sc-co2 jet can fully carry particles with the diameter in the range of 0 1~2 4mm to form the abrasive sc-co2 jet  particles with larger diameter will obtain higher impinging velocity on the impinged target    1  introduction  inman [1] pointed out that the large-scale, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, coupled with horizontal drilling, has led to a boom of the development of the shale gas in the us and may help achieve “a thriving us economy” in the future  however, hughes [2] assumed that it will also bring difficulties like sustainability, high cost, water contamination and other environmental concerns and so forth  likewise, according to eia [3], shale gas industries in china in early stages of development are facing both technical and water resource challenges, in addition to the difficult terrain and high overall costs  considering the huge consumption and exploration of natural gas worldwide, wang et al [4] thought that it is in urgent need to make progresses in operating fluids  according to rogala et al [5], emphasis has been placed on the alternatives to hydraulic fracturing or the non-aqueous fracturing technologies due to its technical and environmental advantages  among the fluids, supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-co2) is hopeful to replace water as a drilling fluid or the abrasive-laden fluid in hydraulic fracturing in shale gas development | 
2015-279 	 study of multiple fracture interaction based on an efficient three-dimensional displacement discontinuity method |abstract  in this paper, we describe efforts to create a computationally efficient model that is accurate for multiple, three dimensional fracture problems  the accuracy of a fast pseudo-3d method (olson, 2004) for describing fracture interaction is investigated through comparing with a fully 3d displacement discontinuity method (ddm)  results demonstrate that the pseudo- 3d solution underestimates the mechanical interaction between nearby fractures  the apertures of both interior and exterior fractures given by the pseudo-3d method are larger than the fully 3d solutions  however, 3d ddm is computationally far more expensive than the pseudo-3d method because a) more elements are required to describe a fracture in three dimensions and b) the computational cost per element is higher in 3d  we show that using 1 element in the fracture height direction with the standard 3d equations is unacceptably inaccurate, but by employing an analytically based correction factor, that accuracy can be significantly improved, eliminating the need for extra elements for height-contained hydraulic fracture problems  the higher per element computation cost in 3d is largely the result of the fact that the 3d displacement discontinuity method has three unknowns (opening, strike-slip shear and dip-slip shear)  further speed advantage is gained by dictating all fractures must be vertical, which allows elimination of equation components related to the dip-slip shear  we demonstrate how this model can be applied to problems of multiple hydraulic fracture propagation in horizontal wells    1  introduction  in recent years, production of tight oil and shale gas has increased exponentially in the united states  multiple fracture treatments in horizontal wellbores are becoming a prevalent approach to economically develop unconventional reservoirs  a better understanding of multiple fracture growth is essential for accurately predicting fracture geometry  mechanical interaction between multiple fractures, also referred to as stress shadow effects, is a critical factor controlling fracture geometry and inducing complex fracture geometry  to better model fracture interaction, an efficient and accuracy method is required  | 
2015-280 	 estimation of rock strength by means of scratch probe |abstract  accurate estimation of rock mass properties is crucial for performing a realistic geomechanical stability analyses  this requires detailed geological information on the rock mass and jointing system, as well as, the intact rock strength  the conventional methods for strength measurement require core samples, which are expensive, have a time lag and are time consuming; and maintaining the in-situ condition and sample preparation are arduous tasks  it would be ideal if the strength of the rock could be estimated in the field as an in-situ measurement inside closely spaced boreholes  estimation of the rock strength by scratching its surface has been reasonably successful  application of this concept for assessment of rock strength in a borehole has led to development of a borehole strength measurement probe  the results of initial tests for development of such probe are presented and explained in this paper  in this study, four different rock samples have been used in cutting tests by a miniature disc cutter  measured normal, rolling and side forces are recorded to allow for establishing a relationship between cutting geometry and rock strength  the results show a promising correlation between the average normal force for cutting the rock surface with a customized disc and the ucs/bts of the rock samples with a reliable coefficient of determination  these outcomes can pave the way for the development of the field borehole probe in subsequent studies    1  introduction  estimating rock mass properties are essential input for performing geomechanical stability analysis for any structure that is constructed in rock and availability of geological information is the crucial component of such analysis  one of the important parameters in evaluating the rock mass properties is the intact rock strength  this parameter is usually measured by testing the core samples, obtained from exploration boreholes and are subsequently tested in geomechanics laboratories  the test results offer limited information about the rock at the few locations for the borings despite all the efforts and costs  however, despite all the efforts made to prepare and test the samples, the results may not necessarily be representative of the behavior of the rock in the field since the test cannot provide the in-situ condition of the ground  the ideal solution is to estimate the rock mass properties in-situ, and inside closely placed drill holes in an underground space  | 
2015-284 	 size effect on length and width of fracture process zone |abstract  a bonded particle model was used to study the fracture process zone (fpz) in three point bending test of notched beams  five different beam sizes of 20 (height) <u+00d7> 60 (span), 40 <u+00d7> 120, 80 <u+00d7> 240, 160 <u+00d7> 480, and 320 <u+00d7> 960 mm2were tested to investigate the effect of specimen size and material ductility on the length and width of the fpz at the peak load  the material ductility was controlled by using different slopes for the post-peak behavior of contacts between the circular particles in tension  a statistical approach is proposed to more objectively calculate the width and length of the fpz  it is shown that the size of fpz depends on specimen size and material ductility  in particular, the shape of fpz is affected by the specimen size  different regression methods are proposed to be able to calculate the length and width of fpz and the best linear regression method is identified and discussed    1  introduction  fracture process zone (fpz) which is made of micro-cracks and damaged contacts between material grains is a common phenomenon in fracture testing of quasi-brittle materials such as rock and concrete  physical testing using acoustic emission (ae) and x-ray technics have confirmed the presence of the fpz in rock, concrete, and asphalt [1,2,3]  while there is agreement on the presence of fracture process zone in the vicinity of a crack tip in quasi-brittle materials, disagreements exist in the literature regarding the size of fracture process zone; it is not clear if size of fpz can be assumed as an intrinsic material property  zietlow and labuz [1] conducted several bending tests on different rocks and studied the evolution of the fpz by using ae technics  they concluded that size of fpz varies significantly between different rock types, but the change is small for different beam sizes of the same material  on the other hand, otsuka and date [2] physical tests on concrete showed significant change in the size of fracture process zone of concrete as the specimen size was modified  | 
2015-286 	 the implementation of 30’ wide undercuts at trjv |abstract  increasing mining productivity is a goal to be achieved in many different ways, employing talents, techniques, and standards from many different areas, both divisional and geographical  the high quality backfill at barrick’s turquoise ridge mine (trjv) has presented the opportunity to test the potential to optimize the dimensions of drifts mining below backfill  other mines in nevada have successfully mined entire levels using an optimized mining sequence that employs the use of 30’ wide undercuts beneath a cemented rock fill sill  the average rock mass rating of the rock mass at trjv is about 40% less than that of other mines in the areas implementing the same undercut dimensions  given this situation, the question of increasing the undercut dimensions has been raised and backed with enthusiasm  the problems that may be faced are both operational and geotechnical, and have presented the opportunity to cooperate between departments around the mine site  these undercuts are planned to be mined in march of 2015  this paper will cover the analyses undertaken to determine the viability of mining these undercuts   1  introduction  the turquoise ridge joint venture (trjv) underground mine is located about 50 km (30 mi) northeast from winnemucca, nv, usa, at the foot of the osgood mountains  the ore body at trjv is highly disseminated over a large area and gold is extracted using underhand cut and fill (uhcf) mining in order to gain the highest possible ore recovery  the rock in these ore bodies is of exceptionally poor quality (rmr 20-35) and requires the implementation of a highly competent backfill  trjv has been involved in several studies involving backfill in the past decade, namely a study in 2007 involving niosh (national institute of occupational safely) as the primary researchers  this study involved successfully instrumenting and mining a 13 7 m (45’) wide undercut below a 4 6 m (15’) thick layer of backfill  this particular study will differ from the previous in that the wide spans will be left open for an extended period of time  this drift will eventually be implemented as a tire shop  there will be two 30’ wide undercuts that will be separated by a 20’ wide backfill pillar  this pillar will be monitored for stability as it is mined and for long term stability after this area is abandoned  the previous 45’ wide span was opened up in an area with relatively high rmr values under a singular 15’ tall backfill sill above  the location of the 30’ wide cuts at the center of this study are located in the high grade bullion (hgb) zone of the mine, located approximately 2200’ from ground surface  mining these 30’ wide cuts will mark the first time in the history of trjv that a 30’ wide cut will be implemented in to the normal mining cycle in a highly active mining zone | 
2015-287 	 stick-slip instabilities in rotary drilling systems |abstract  this paper addresses the issue of stick-slip instabilities experienced by drag bit-equipped rotary drilling systems operating at large depths  in particular, on the basis of a simple model of the drillstring combined to an advanced bit/rock interface law, it is shown by way of a case study that a critical rotation speed exists  this critical speed separates two unstable dynamical regimes  above it, instabilities grow on a slow timescale as compared to the resonant period of the torsional pendulum modeling the drilling apparatus  below it, instabilities grow on a fast timescale  accordingly, the model is more prone to nonlinear instabilities such as torsional stick-slip oscillations when operated at rotation speeds below the critical speed than it is above it   1  introduction  rotary drilling systems are known to experience instability regimes of various natures, e g , bit bouncing or bit whirling, that are detrimental to the drilling performance and tool life  in this paper, we focus on another type of instability: stick-slip oscillations  in particular, we revisit the stability analysis of the discrete model proposed by richard et al  [1] to study the self-excited torsional and axial vibrations of deep drilling systems   specific to the model is the definition of the drilling action as the sum of two components, one representing fragmentation and excavation of rocks by the bit cutters, the other a frictional contact process taking place on the cutter wearflats  as a direct consequence of the bit rotary motion, the cutting process, which is a function of the height of the rock ridge in front of the cutters, introduces a so-called regenerative effect in the model governing equations that are therefore of the retarded differential equation type with a discrete state-dependent delay | 
2015-290 	 geomechanical modeling to predict wellbore stresses and strains for the design of wellbore seal repair materials for use at a co2 injection site |abstract  this paper presents results of three models simulating the hydrological-mechanical behavior of a co2 injection reservoir and the resulting effects on wellbore system (cement and casing) and seal repair materials  a critical aspect of designing effective wellbore seal repair materials is predicting thermo-mechanical perturbations that can compromise seal integrity  three distinct computational models comprise the current modeling effort  the first model depicts bench-top experiments of an integrated seal system in an idealized scaled wellbore mock-up being used to test candidate seal repair materials  this model will be used to gain an understanding of the wellbore microannulus compressibility and permeability  the second is a field scale model that uses the stratigraphy, material properties, and injection history from a pilot co2 injection operation to develop stress-strain histories for wellbore locations from 100 to 400 meters from an injection well  the results from these models are used as input to a more detailed model of a wellbore system  the 3d wellbore model examines the impacts of various loading scenarios on a wellbore system   the results from these models will be used to estimate the necessary thermal-mechanical properties needed for a successful repair material    1  introduction  a critical aspect of designing effective wellbore seal repair materials is predicting thermo-mechanical perturbations in local stress that can compromise seal integrity  for applications associated with co2 sequestration, the stress-strain history of abandoned wells, as well as changes in local pressure, stress, and temperature conditions that accompany carbon dioxide injection or brine extraction are of interest  building on existing thermo-hydro-mechanical (thm) finite element modeling of wellbore casings subject to significant tensile and shear loads, we have been developing advancements to a conceptual and numerical methodology to assess responses of annulus cement and casing  the experimental component utilizes bench-top experiments of an integrated seal system in an idealized scaled wellbore mock-up to test candidate seal repair materials [1, 2]  these bench-top experiments have been modeled with bench-scale numerical models to identify and evaluate the essential hydrologic and mechanical properties of the candidate sealants  field scale models using the stratigraphy from a pilot co2 injection operation can be used to estimate the necessary mechanical properties needed for a successful repair material [2, 3] | 
2015-291 	 coupled geomechanics and fluid flow computational algorithm for modeling hydraulic fracturing with pre-existing natural fractures in unconventional shale reservoirs |abstract  this paper proposes a two-dimensional (2d), time-dependent, and tightly coupled computational algorithm for hydraulic fracturing simulations  it uses the cubic law model for computing the fluid flow in opened fractures and fluid volume caged inside the fractures  a finite element method (fem) is used to evaluate stresses and deformation of elastic rock blocks  the lagrange multipliers method is used to prevent penetration during contact between adjacent rock blocks while imposing fracture tip displacement constraint conditions  the propagation criterion of hydraulically induced fractures is imposed by mixed mode stress intensity factor, which is calculated using a displacement correlation method  this scheme is also coupled with tensile and shearfailure models to describe natural fracture evolution and its interaction with approaching hydraulically induced fractures  the geomechanics and fluid dynamics common components naturally lead to a tightly coupled integrative system, where its unknowns are rock block corner displacements, the lagrange multipliers in case blocks in contact or displacement constraints applied, and fluid pressure at junctions of opened fractures  the proposed algorithm solves for all unknowns simultaneously and in a tightly coupled manner, while the general newton algorithm is implemented for solving the overall nonlinear system of equations at each time step   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing treatments in horizontal wells are used to produce unconventional formations, such as tight gas sands and gas shale [1]  although hydraulic fracturing technology has been used practically for some time, the associated numerical simulations still pose some crucial challenges  a basic review of relevant hydraulic fracturing aspects is provided [2]  most geomechanics models used are based on single-fracture geometry and some analytical solutions, such as the pkn [3] and kgd [4] models  however, pre-existing natural fractures in unconventional reservoirs contribute more uncertainties during the fracturing process in terms of propagation of hydraulic fractures and the interaction between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures  the interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures could generate a complex fracture network (cfn) other than simple fracture geometries | 
2015-293 	 developing a framework to simulate the hydraulic fracturing of tight gas reservoirs based on integrative adaptive remeshing and combined finite/discrete element approach |abstract  hydraulic fracturing in tight gas reservoirs is a complex physical process with interactions between fracking fluid flow in a confined channel, fracture propagation in reaction to an initial and evolving stress state, proppant transport inside an advancing fracture and finally gas production over the life-time of the well  this paper outlines the modelling methodology of a combined finite element (fe) and discrete element (de) technology which is used in the software package elfen to simulate hydraulic fracturing  current fe/de technologies require a fine mesh in the region of the advancing tip to satisfactorily capture stress concentrations  the developments are centred on the capability to simulate fracture propagation within a geometry fracture insertion rather than element splitting framework  a local remeshing scheme is adopted instead of a traditional global remeshing procedure in which a fine mesh is maintained only adjacent to fracture tips to readily cut down on computational cost  the newly developed technology is demonstrated on simulating fluid driven fractures in single and multiple stimulated wells   1  introduction  in light of the recent commercial interest in the hydraulic stimulation of unconventional reservoirs, the key processes involved have received much attention in the scientific community  the hydraulic fracturing process has been employed to enhance the production of oil and gas from underground reservoirs [1]  hydraulic stimulation is a particularly energy and resource intensive operation  a typical frack pump will be rated from 700 to 2700 hydraulic horsepower [2]  a single stage hydraulic fracturing treatment can consist of 4 2 million gallons of slickwater [3]  the injected proppant amount varies from about 36,000 to over 140,000 kg per stage [4]  with these enormous numbers it is imperative to enhance the hydraulic stimulation process to reduce both the amount of energy and resources used  modelling approaches tied closer to a better understanding of the physical processes offer a robust framework in which to move forward | 
2015-294 	 laboratory measurements of flow through wellbore cement-casing microannuli |abstract  microannuli that develop along the cement-casing interface have been identified as common leakage pathways in wellbores  we have developed an experimental system that allows laboratory testing of wellbore specimens which are comprised of a cement sheath cast on a steel casing  specimens were produced with a range of flaws including microannuli between the steel casing and the cement  the system allows independent application of confining pressures to 35 mpa and casing pressures to 20 mpa while gas flow is measured through the specimens along the wellbore axis  we present the gas flow results in terms of the hydraulic aperture of microannuli as a function of confining pressure and internal pressure for two different types of microannuli  hydraulic apertures decrease non-linearly with increasing stress across the microannuli in a manner similar to fractures in rocks and other materials  the hydraulic apertures are more sensitive to changes in confining pressure than casing pressure, consistent with the estimated contact stress that develops across the cement-casing interface    1  introduction  the integrity of wellbore systems - consisting of casing, cement sheath and adjacent rock formation – is of critical importance to many sub-surface operations including co2 sequestration, oil and gas exploration and production, and geothermal energy development  wellbore systems can have a significant vertical permeability due to the presence of flaws (factures, voids) that allow for fluid migration along the axis of the wellbore [e g , 1]  the cement-casing interface, herein referred to as the microannulus, has been identified as a common leakage pathway [2, 3, 4]  the flaws are created by a range of factors during well cementing and subsequent well operations, including incomplete drilling mud removal prior to cementing, cement shrinkage, and changes in pressures and temperatures within the casing [5] | 
2015-296 	 dynamic tensile failure of rocks subjected to simulated in situ stresses around underground openings |abstract  it is critical to understand the dynamic tensile failure of rocks subjected to pre-tension for rock engineering applications such as underground mining and tunneling  a modified split hopkinson pressure bar (shpb) system is applied to load brazilian disc (bd) samples statically, and then exert dynamic load to the sample through a stress wave generated by impact  the pulse shaper technique is used to generate a slowly rising stress wave to facilitate the stress equilibrium of samples  five groups of laurentian granite bd samples (with tensile strength of 12 8 mpa) under the pre-tension of 0 mpa, 2 mpa, 4 mpa, 8 mpa, and 10 mpa were tested under different loading rates  the results show that the rock dynamic tensile strength decreases with the increase of the pre-tension  it is also observed that under the same pre-tension, the dynamic tensile strength increases with the loading rate  however, the total tensile strength of the rock is roughly independent of the pre-tension  the failure patterns of the samples also reveal the rate dependence of the dynamic strength of rocks    1  introduction  tensile failure is a main failure mode of rocks in underground projects, in which rocks are subjected to dynamic disturbances while under in situ stresses  as is well known, pores and microcracks are potential sources of failure for rock materials because of stress concentration [1-3]  when disturbed by dynamic loads from blasting, seismicity, or rockbursts, the underground rocks would be vulnerable to tensile failure  even though the far-field load is compressive, the local stresses may be tensile as shown in fig  1  from a macroscopic point of view, the bending of the roof induces tensile stress at the roof of the opening; from a microscopic view, the discontinuities in the rock result in tensile stress locally  on top of these pre-tension, dynamic disturbance may be tensile in nature and lead to the ultimate failure of the rock material  therefore, it is necessary to investigate the dynamic tensile failure of rock materials under pre-tension | 
2015-297 	 incorporating viscous, toughness, and intermediate regimes of propagation into enhanced pseudo-3d model |abstract  the design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment typically requires using a computational model that provides rapid results  one such possibility is to use the so-called classical pseudo-3d (p3d) model with symmetric stress barriers  unfortunately, the original p3d model is unable to capture effects associated with fracture toughness in the lateral direction due to the fact that the assumption of plane-strain (or local) elasticity is used  on the other hand, a recently developed enhanced p3d model utilizes full elastic interactions and is capable of incorporating either toughness or viscous regimes of propagation by using the corresponding asymptotic solution at the tip element  since either the viscous or toughness asymptote is used, the intermediate regime is not described accurately  to deal with this problem, this study aims to implement the intermediate asymptotic solution into the enhanced p3d model  to assess the level of accuracy, the results are compared to a reference solution  the latter reference solution is calculated numerically using a fully planar hydraulic fracturing simulator (implicit level set algorithm (ilsa)), which also incorporates the asymptotic solution for tip elements that captures the transition from viscous to toughness regime   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing (hf) plays a crucial role in the petroleum industry, as it allows one to perform reservoir stimulation and intensify hydrocarbon production [1]  to design a hf treatment, an appropriate hf model needs to be utilized  the simplest model is the onedimensional khristianovich-zheltov-geertsma-de klerk (kgd) model [2], in which the fracture propagates in a plane, the elastic interactions are modelled assuming that plane strain conditions prevail, and the coupling between viscous fluid flow and elasticity is included  to represent the fracture geometry more realistically, the perkins-kern- nordgren (pkn) model [3, 4] was developed to predict fracture propagation in a horizontally layered medium  the pkn model assumes that the fracture height is always equal to the thickness of the reservoir layer, the fracture opening in each vertical cross-section is taken to be elliptic, while the fluid pressure is calculated assuming that a plane strain condition holds in each cross-section  given the fact that the pkn model does not allow for the height growth, the pseudo-3d (p3d) model, which permits height growth, has been developed [5]  later, with the increase of the computational power, more accurate planar 3d models (pl3d) were developed [7, 8]  as follows from the name, the fracture is contained in one plane, where the fracture geometry within this plane is discretized using a two-dimensional grid  since the kgd, pkn and p3d are essentially one-dimensional models, while all varieties of pl3d are two-dimensional, the cpu time increases dramatically  the pl3d models improve accuracy and open the possibility of capturing different fracture geometries  recently, researchers have shifted their effort to investigate the interaction between multiple hydraulic fractures that are growing simultaneously [9], and to describe non-planar fracture propagation [10]  | 
2015-298 	 effect of hydraulic diffusivity and slipping zone thickness on thermal pressurization process during seismic slip |abstract  in this study, we numerically simulated thermal pressurization of a fault and investigated temperature and pore pressure changes during seismic slip  thermal pressurization of fault fluid during slip tends to reduce frictional resistance by increasing pore pressure along the fault  we used a coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical finite element model to simulate thermal pressurization by implementing a simple constitutive law to couple pore pressure changes with temperature rise due to frictional heating  the effects of hydraulic diffusivity and slipping zone thickness on pore pressure and temperature changes were investigated  the parametric study results showed that the weakening rate increases by decreasing the slipping zone thickness  lower hydraulic diffusivity was shown to induce larger reduction in the effective normal stress   1  introduction  once fault slip is initiated, two mechanisms with opposite impacts compete to control slip and rate of slip (segall & bradley, 2012)  shear-induced dilatancy of the fault core tends to increase fault permeability and consequently, to decrease fluid pressure  in contrary, fault heating inclines to increase fluid pressure and to weaken the fault (rice 2006, segal and bradly 2012)  an earthquake occurs if the thermal weakening process during the fault’s early slip takes over the shear-induced dilatency due to the release of tectonic stress (wibberley & shimamoto, 2005)  two thermal mechanisms, referred to as flash heating and thermal pressurization, can weaken the fault and decrease frictional resistance along the fault (j  r  rice, 2006)   flash heating occurs in rapid slips and mostly depends on the slip rate (rice 2006)  this mechanism deals with highly stressed micro-scale contacts during slip and decreases the fault friction coefficient  the real contact area (i e , slip surface) is the sum of contact areas of all the asperities which is a small fraction of the macroscopic contact area  since the stress supported by the asperities is larger than the stress carried by the fault surface, sliding leads to a large heat production and weakening of the contact (rice, 1999; tullis & goldsby, 2003; prakash, 2004; rice, 2006; beeler et al , 2008) | 
2015-299 	 3d simulation of fluid-pressure-induced fracture nucleation and growth in rock samples |abstract  fluid-pressure-driven (or hydraulic) fracturing of rocks is used in several applications including stimulation of unconventional reservoirs, permeability enhancement of geothermal systems, and rock mass pre-conditioning in deep mining  in recent years, there has been a fast growing interest in the development and use of advanced numerical methods to better describe hydraulic fracturing processes  in this paper, recent advances in hydraulic fracturing modeling using a three-dimensional hybrid finite-discrete element (fdem) code are presented  fdem is an explicit numerical method which combines continuum mechanics principles with discrete element algorithms to simulate multiple interacting deformable fracturable solids  the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by simulating two cases of fracture nucleation and growth around a pressurized cylindrical cavity in a homogeneous and isotropic medium  realistic emergent pressure response and fracture patterns are obtained with the simulated fracture networks highlighting a distinctive 3d interaction of individual fractures around the location of injection    1  introduction  fluid-pressure-driven (or hydraulic) fracturing is used in several engineering applications, including stimulation of low-permeability oil and gas reservoirs, permeability enhancement of hot dry geothermal systems, and rock mass pre-conditioning in deep mines  although the process of fluid-pressure-driven fracturing in geomaterials is generally well understood, its quantitative description is still a largely open research topic due to physical complexities and geological uncertainties  in particular, the mechanics of hydraulic fracturing involves complex, non-linear, hydro-mechanical processes occurring on different length scales in a three-dimensional space  one of the main research areas in this field is represented by the development of new simulation tools capable of capturing an increasing number of physical processes with a higher level of detail and with minimal assumptions regarding the problem dimensionality  the goal of this paper is to present the latest advances in the 3d simulation of pressure-induced fracturing processes in brittle rocks using a numerical approach based on a hybrid finite-discrete element method (fdem) | 
2015-300 	 capturing early evolution of salt openings |abstract  in situ tests implemented in a research facility mined from salt deposits, if planned appropriately, provide an opportunity to characterize the host rock before, during, and after excavation of test rooms  characterization of the test bed is essential to interpret structural deformation, creation and evolution of the disturbed rock zone, and measurement of first-order hydromechanical properties as the salt evolves from an impermeable undisturbed state to a more-transmissive damaged state  the strategy expounded upon in this paper describes recommended geophysical measurements to characterize the initial state of a potential test bed and its evolution over the course of a field test  discussion includes what measurements could be made, why the measurements would be made, how they are made, and how accurately they need to be made  quantifiable parameters will establish field-scale boundary conditions and data quality objectives to characterize the test bed in an underground salt research facility   1  introduction  salt formations enjoy many favorable characteristics that combine to make them promising media for permanent radioactive waste disposal [1]  salt formations are plentiful in the united states, providing ample areal extent and substantial thickness in aseismic geologic settings [2]  in addition to high thermal conductivity and plastic deformational response, undisturbed salt has extremely low permeability and porosity  some of the favorable characteristics are modified during the excavation process and evolve during operations  accounting for these fundamental structural and hydrologic changes is essential for establishing credible repository performance models needed to support waste disposal licensing activities  before conducting experiments or operational demonstrations in a salt underground research facility, significant changes have already occurred in the salt, leading to a disturbed environment for hosting experiments  the disturbed rock zone (drz) near the excavation free surfaces contains inter-connected flow paths between pre-existing, but previously impermeable formation brine filled porosity, and becomes an anisotropic region of higher permeability and porosity  depending upon experiment objectives, liberated brine, either in the vapor or liquid phase, and increased porosity can significantly influence evolution of the test bed  in addition, transient creep strain accumulates rapidly at the onset of excavation, but is not measurable once mining has already occurred  using only observations from within the excavation overlooks potentially large strain accumulation in the salt formation  to model salt deformation completely, we must account for the transient creep contribution  fortunately, evolutionary characteristics of salt are qualitatively known and straightforward engineering measurements can be made to quantify early evolution  this can allow the experimentalist to capture fully the early deformation for structural model development and validation  | 
2015-301 	 impact of depletion on integrity of sand screen in depleted unconsolidated sandstone formation |abstract  in this paper, the integrity of sand screen is evaluated for various depletions using fluid-mechanical coupling analysis  the interaction between the screen and reservoir is captured by rock-structure interaction model, based on laboratory tests that measured the mechanical properties of ceramic proppant, the formation sandstone and sand screen  the frictional hardening properties of the ceramic proppant and sandstone core plugs are measured by performing constant mean-stress tests in rock mechanics laboratory  the volumetric hardening curve of sandstone is measured in isotropic compression tests (with unloading excursions)  the elasto-plastic mechanical properties of sand screen are determined by calibrating the laboratory crushing test data  for a given maximum depletion, this model can be used to select appropriate sand screens; conversely, for a given sand screen, this model can be used to estimate the depletion where failure is likely    1  introduction  the reduction of formation pore pressure induced by fluid production in water and hydrocarbon reservoirs could result in many serious consequences, including subsidence of earth surface, loss of overburden integrity, reduction of porosity and permeability of formation, damage of well construction and production parts such as casing and tubing strings (schutjens et al , 2004, 2008)   open-hole standalone screens and gravel packs are often-used sand control methods in unconsolidated sandstone  as reservoir pressure depletes, the effective stresses in the formation increase  the depletion-induced increase in effective stresses are further magnified by the near wellbore stress concentration  because the strength of unconsolidated sandstone is low and the gravel pack provides only a limited support to the wellbore wall, plastic deformation near the well seems inevitable in many wells  as a result, the forces acting on the sand screen increase  when formation loads exceed the loading capacity of the sand screen, the integrity of the screen is lost resulting in sand control failure and lost production | 
2015-302 	 verification of the implementation of rock-reinforcement elements in numerical analyses based on the hybrid combined finitediscrete element method (fdem) |abstract  in recent years, analyses based on the hybrid finite-discrete element method (fdem) have been shown to provide a realistic representation of rock deformation and fracturing processes at laboratory and engineering scales  however, the ability to model linear rock reinforcement elements within fdem has been largely limited  through a collaborative research effort between geomechanica inc  and queen’s university, an implementation of one-dimensional linear rock reinforcement elements has been recently developed to extend the applicability of fdem modeling to a wider scope of rock engineering problems  while previous verification efforts have considered pure axial loading, the current paper extends these efforts to more complex shear loading  through a series of small-scale double shear test simulations, the resulting specimen damage and reinforcement deformation profiles are compared to those observed in a larger-scale physical laboratory test  however, no attempt is made to match the laboratory tests directly; rather the ability of the approach to capture the general mechanistic behavior is assessed    1  introduction  rock support and reinforcement measures are widely employed in civil and mining rock engineering projects to maintain or improve rock mass integrity  the preferred type of reinforcement or support elements along with the preferred layout and installation timing depend on many factors, including: the in-situ conditions (i e , stress, rock strength and rock mass quality), the nature of the project (i e , long term or short term support), and the selected excavation method (i e , drill and blast or mechanical)    over the last two decades, numerical modeling has been increasingly used to design and optimize rock reinforcement and support systems  as such, most rock engineering-specific modeling software includes approaches for modeling various rock reinforcement and support elements | 
2015-303 	 geomechanics issues regarding heat-generating waste disposal in salt |abstract  with an abundance of scientific information in hand, what are the remaining geomechanics issues for a salt repository for heat-generating nuclear waste disposal? the context of this question pertains to the development of a license application, rather than an exploration of the entire breadth of salt research  the technical foundation supporting a licensed salt repository has been developed in the united states and germany since the 1960s  although the level of effort has been inconsistent and discontinuous over the years, site characterization activities, laboratory testing, field-scale experiments, and advanced computational capability provide information and tools required for a license application, should any nation make that policy decision  ample scientific bases exist to develop a safety case in the event a site is identified and governing regulations promulgated  some of the key remaining geomechanics issues pertain to application of advanced computational tools to the repository class of problems, refinement of constitutive models and their validation, reduction of uncertainty in a few areas, operational elements, and less tractable requirements that may arise from regulators and stakeholders  this realm of issues as they pertain to salt repositories is being addressed in various research, development and demonstration activities in the united states and germany, including extensive collaborations  many research areas such as constitutive models and performance of geotechnical barriers have industry applications beyond repositories  and, while esoteric salt-specific phenomenology and micromechanical processes remain of interest, they will not be reviewed here  the importance of addressing geomechanics issues and their associated prioritization are a matter of discussion, though the discriminating criterion for considerations in this paper is a demonstrable tie to the salt repository safety case    1  introduction  geomechanical response of the geologic formation to perturbations caused by excavation, structural evolution over time, subsequent disposal of heat-generating waste, and emplacement of sealing systems are first-order concerns for heat-generating nuclear waste disposal in salt  use of salt formations for toxic waste and transuranic waste disposal is supported by broad technical understanding and experience gained from operating facilities in the united states (u s ) and germany  the waste isolation pilot plant (wipp) in new mexico represents a successful process of site characterization and licensing of a salt repository in the u s , while germany has compiled the preliminary safety analysis for gorleben (vorlaufige sicherheits-analyse gorleben or vsg) [1]  sufficient scientific bases exist to develop a viable safety case for heat-generating waste if a national program should decide to move in that direction | 
2015-304 	 a combined experimental (micro-ct) and numerical (fdem) methodology to study rock joint asperities subjected to direct shear |abstract  discontinuities are prevalent in most rock masses and represent planes of preferential deformation and fluid flow  shear displacements can significantly alter the hydro-mechanical properties of discontinuities and, thus, the hydro-mechanical properties of the entire rock mass  the importance of the network of discontinuities in controlling rock mass behavior has long been known and has led to an abundance of research on discontinuity shear strength and transmissivity  although well-studied, key aspects of discontinuity behavior and characterization have received lesser focus, namely the evolution of asperity damage and discontinuity void space morphology as a result of shearing  in this paper, a methodology that combines the use of two recent technologies (micro-x-ray computed tomography and combined finite-discrete element modeling) is described to study these aspects of discontinuity behavior   1  introduction  rock mass discontinuities represent planes of relative weakness and enhanced hydraulic conductivity and, thus, have a significant influence on the hydromechanical behavior of the overall rock mass  while the shearing of rock mass discontinuities has been extensively studied in the past, there remains uncertainty surrounding the mechanisms by which surface asperities deform and degrade and how this degradation influences the aperture distribution    although many studies have attempted to investigate asperity failure mechanisms, they have been hampered by the lack of appropriate visualization and modeling tools  in particular, until recently it was not possible to observe asperity damage without physically separating the joint specimen or explicitly modeling the development of damage during a direct shear test | 
2015-305 	 numerical model of extended leak-off test (xlot) |abstract  we report on numerical simulations of extended leak-off tests (xlot) in a low-permeability rock formation and how they are impacted by the presence of a natural fracture  the simulations are carried out by using a newly developed modified discrete-element model (mdem)  the main features of xlot are reproduced by the mdem simulations  in the absence of a natural fracture, the hydraulic fractures created during xlot grow perpendicular to the minimum principal stress  if a conductive natural fracture intersects the wellbore, fracture twisting is observed, and the xlot pressure curves are markedly different from the pressure curves recorded in the absence of a natural fracture    1  introduction|an extended leak-off test (xlot) provides information on hydraulic-fracture initiation and propagation in a rock formation at a given depth, as well as the magnitude of the minimum principal stress [1-4]  xlot is usually carried out in a few-meter long open-hole section below a casing shoe  in this way, the test also provides information on the cement integrity  the test consists of typically two to three injection cycles during which the well is pressurized until a hydraulic fracture is initiated (or re-opened) and propagated a few meters into the formation  after injection is stopped, the pressure decay due to leak-off and fracture closure is recorded  in low-permeability formations, leak-off is small so that flow-back is needed to induce fracture closure  closure of the fracture results in an inflexion in the pressure vs  time curve, and this fracture-closure pressure directly corresponds to the minimum principal stress  |for vertical wells and simple stress and geological settings, analytical models can be applied to the description and interpretation of xlot data, allowing for an accurate determination of the minimum principal stress  however, for deviated wells, rotated stress field, heterogeneous rock formations, or in the presence of natural fractures, the hydraulic fracturing process during xlot can be rather complex (including fracture twisting or fracture snap-off), and conventional analytical models may not be applicable any longer [5] | 
2015-307 	 redistribution of stresses due to drilling and depletion using different plasticity models |abstract  this paper studies vertical stress redistributions around wellbores and reservoirs due to yielding and plastic deformations  the analyses in this paper compare between predictions of elastic, poroelastic, elastoplastic, and poroplastic material models  two elastoplastic models are used: 1) the drucker prager model (dp), and 2) the mohr coulomb model (mc); while the modified cam clay model (mcc) is used as the poroplastic model  although all models are calibrated to the behavior of an analogue shale using drained triaxial compression tests; the models give different predictions in other modes of shearing and other drainage conditions  two geomechanical problems are considered in the paper: 1) the wellbore stability problem, and 2) the reservoir depletion problem; both of which are analyzed using the finite element commercial software abaqus  the wellbore problem considers an undrained vertical wellbore in uniform horizontal stress conditions using a 2d plane strain model  analyses show that the mc model gives safe predictions and comparable results of vertical stress redistribution to that of the mcc model  the reservoir problem considers a circular disc-like reservoir using a 2d axisymmetric model  the initial stress distribution is considered; once assuming constant far field stresses, and also including the effect of variation due to gravity  vertical stress redistribution is significant when plastic pore collapse is considered by using the mcc model for reservoir material  analysis shows that assuming constant far field stresses is a good approximation to the reservoir depletion problem    1  introduction  the geomechanical analysis of wellbores and reservoirs usually includes the assumption of constant vertical stresses  the safe mud window for stable wellbores is determined to prevent the hoop stresses from causing a breakout, ignoring possible change in vertical stresses  dunayevsky et al  [1] formulated a semi-analytical solution to the thick wall cylinder problem  in this solution the vertical stresses are assumed constant  zoback [2] formulated the dars (deformation analysis in reservoir space) methodology to measure the stress path and compaction of a depleting reservoir  this stress path is considered in the reservoir space where only horizontal stresses vary with pore pressures  the idea of constant vertical stresses is plausible because at any given level the vertical stresses would be the weight of the overburden which is not expected to change  if the theory of elasticity is applied to the reservoir depletion problem, the vertical stresses do not change for infinitely long reservoirs  segal and fitzgerald [3] stated that for a reservoir of aspect ratio 10:1, the change in vertical stress can be ignored as predicted by the theory of elasticity | 
2015-308 	 investigation of rock fragmentation mechanism using dynamic spherical crushing test |abstract  understanding fragmentation behaviour of rock under crushing process is fundamental to improved productivity and efficiency in mining operations  during crushing, rock is subjected to dynamic loading and the particle shape influent the fragmentation of crushed rock  thus, a highly controlled single particle test, the dynamic spherical crushing test, should be performed to establish the relation between the energy and size reduction for better understanding the crushing mechanism  in this work, a split hopkinson pressure bar system in combination with high speed cameras was utilized to carry out a single particle crushing test  spherical rocks samples were adopted to avoid the shape effect for fragmentation process  the energy absorbed by samples was accurately determined from the one-dimensional wave analysis and the kinetic energy of the sample fragments estimated from the high speed camera snapshots  the crushed samples were recycled after the test  further by counting the newly generated surface from sample fragments, the surface energy was determined for each sample  the indirect tensile strength is consistent with that of reported brazilian disc test  the determined surface energy increases with the loading rate  above results indicate a trade-off should be established between the fragment size and energy consumption    1  introduction  crushers are widely used in the mining industry all over the world, which break rocks to extract specific minerals or specific size fractionation of fragmented rocks for construction  suggested by many researches, highly controllable single particle test should be performed to understand the fundamental crushing mechanism of rock particle [1-3]  from single particle breakage data, we can acquire several important factors for crusher design and selection: particle strength [1-3] and the energy-size reduction relationships [1]  a wide range of laboratory techniques have been developed, which were broadly classified into three types based on loading methods [4]: slow compression breakage; single impact; double impact  the slow compression breakage method is known as utilizing two rigid plates break rock particle with slow speed (e g  strain rate 10-3 s-1)  the single impact utilized compressed air to accelerate rock particles to a designed speed and hit a solid surface, and investigate the breakage probability of particles; while the double impact test, such as drop weight test or pendulum test, is named in that particle is crushed by two hard surfaces  the disadvantage of the static compression test is that the loading speed is too slow as compared with those encountered in real crushers  the energy absorbed by particles during fragmentation cannot be acquired for single impact tests, which is also impossible for double impact test, except of some attempts made on the pendulum tester [2]  | 
2015-310 	 probabilistic time-dependent thermo-chemo-poroelastic borehole stability analysis in shale formations |abstract  the importance of an accurate geomechanical model for borehole stability assessment is increasing in the petroleum industry due to the growth in the number of drilling operations in unconventional reservoirs  these reservoirs are thin layered, naturally fractured with high clay content; the presence of clay minerals in particular, make their behavior to be unpredictable and also make the rocks to become chemically active with the drilling fluid  thus, wellbore stability analysis is crucial and challenging; in addition a good understanding of elastic and physiochemical properties of the formation would be necessary for better field development to avoid future financial losses  for this study elastic, petrophysical and physicochemical properties of the shaly bakken formation were tested and reported from a several number of core plugs in different wells drilled in the williston basin, north dakota  we measured and reported various poro-mechanical, petrophysical and physiochemical properties of the bakken shale along with the chemical properties of the drilling mud  the direction and the magnitude of the horizontal principal stresses were measured in the field with the data acquired from advanced logging tools in several wells  all of these values are coupled and used as input parameters in a time-dependent chemo-thermo-poroelastic constitutive model to calculate in-situ stresses and pore-pressure variations around the borehole  changes in radial and hoop stresses were also plotted in the vicinity of the well  mohr-columb failure criterion was applied to the model to evaluate the deformations and failure occurrences around the borehole  finally probabilistic risk assessment was carried out to understand the sensitivity of the results to the uncertainties in the input data    1  introduction  drilling in shale formations as the main target is becoming pretty popular with the recent growth in the production from shale oils throughout the world and specifically in the u s  from many years in the petroleum industry, shales are attributed to drilling problems such as pipe sticking, washout and borehole collapse  swelling, shrinkage and wellbore failure is a common phenomenon in chemically active shales, which is due to the high clay content [2, 3, 5, 6]  it has been reported that 90% of wellbore instability occurs in shale formations  as a result a good understanding of shale thermal, mechanical and physiochemical processes that take place during drilling operation would be inevitable to suppress the risks and future hazards  | 
2015-311 	 anisotropic geomaterial deformation formulation for the combined finite-discrete element method in 2d |abstract  in this paper, the combined finite-discrete element method (fdem) has been applied to analyze the deformation of anisotropic geomaterials  in the most general case geomaterials are both non-homogeneous and non-isotropic  with the aim of addressing anisotropic material problems, improved 2d fdem formulations have been developed  these formulations feature the unified hypo-hyper elastic approach combined with a multiplicative decomposition-based selective integration for volumetric and shear deformation modes  this approach is significantly different from the co-rotational formulations typically encountered in finite element codes  unlike the co-rotational formulation, the multiplicative decomposition-based formulation naturally decomposes deformation into translation, rotation, plastic stretches, elastic stretches, volumetric stretches, shear stretches, etc  this approach can be implemented for a whole family of finite elements from solids to shells and membranes  this novel 2d fdem based material formulation was designed in such a way that the anisotropic properties of the solid can be specified in a cell by cell basis, therefore enabling the user to seed these anisotropic properties following any type of spatial variation, for example, following a curvilinear path  in addition, due to the selective integration, there are no problems with volumetric or shear locking with any type of finite element employed   1  introduction  in this work a unified constitutive approach for a 2d composite triangle has been developed for the combined finite-discrete element method (fdem) [1-3]  since its inception the fdem has become a tool of choice for a diverse field of practical engineering and scientific simulations[4-9]  from the very initial idea of fdem a large strain-large displacement formulation for the finite element side of fdem has been employed in its exact multiplicative decomposition (as opposed to co-rotational) formulation  in recent years this formulation has been generalized through the concept of the so called munjiza material element, which enables a pragmatic engineering approach to anisotropic constitutive law formulations for both large displacements and large strains in the context of the exact decomposition-based format  this approach has been recently described in detail in the book entitled “large strain finite element method: a practical course” by munjiza et al  [10], where also some novel concepts of selective integration have been proposed and applied to a whole family of finite elements  one of the elements proposed is the composite triangle finite element in 2d  in this work, this element has been implemented into an in-house fdem software package  through numerical examples the generalized anisotropic capabilities of the unified constitutive approach have been demonstrated and are presented in this paper  | 
2015-312 	 fdem simulation on a triaxial core-flood experiment of shale |abstract  hydraulic fracturing (hydrofrac) is a very successful method that has been used to extract oil and gas from highly carbonate rocks like shale for a number of decades  however, there are still many aspects related to hydrofrac operations and how they affect the hydrocarbon’s recovery levels that remain poorly understood  at los alamos national laboratory (lanl), the combined finite-discrete element (fdem) modeling team is working in conjunction with an experimental team to improve the understanding of fracture initiation and propagation in shale rocks  in this paper, in order to address the effects of the fluid pressure, a pseudo fluid solver has been implemented in lanl’s in-house fdem code  the pseudo fluid solver calculates the pressure in the fluid domain as a function of both the time and the distance from the fluid source  during the hydrofrac simulation, the pressure calculated from the pseudo solver is applied to the original free faces as well as the faces created by fracturing  after that, the sensitivity of the obtained fracture patterns related to uncertainties and/or changes in the boundary conditions is demonstrated using fdem  simulation results compared to triaxial core flooding experiments are presented  fdem numerical simulations were able to replicate the main features of the fracturing processes while showing the importance of fluid penetration into fractures as well as layering in determining final fracture patterns    1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing (hydrofrac) is a successful method used to extract oil and gas from highly carbonate rocks like shale and it has been used by industry since the mid- 50s [1-4]  however, there are many things that are still not clear regarding the mechanisms governing the hydraulic fracturing  to better understand how to improve hydrofrac recovery efficiencies and to lower its costs, lanl recently funded the laboratory directed research and development (ldrd) project: “discovery science of hydraulic fracturing: innovative working fluids and their interactions with rocks, fractures, and hydrocarbons”  under the support of this project, the ldrd modeling team is working in collaboration with the experimental team to improve the understanding of fracture initiation and propagation in shale rocks  | 
2015-313 	 fdem simulation on fracture coalescence in brittle materials |abstract  fracture coalescence has been identified as one of the factors playing an important role in the behavior of brittle materials  in this paper this phenomena is simulated by using an in-house implementation of the combined finite-discrete element method (fdem)  key aspects of fdem include the introduction of finite displacements, finite rotations, and finite strain based deformability combined with suitable material laws; the incorporation of discrete element based transient dynamics, contact detection, and contact interaction solutions and objective discrete crack initiation and crack propagation solutions that have a great deal of fidelity in reproducing complex fracture patterns and eventual fragmentation  the first examples presented in this paper consist of compression virtual experiments conducted on specimens that have two pre-existing flaws inside them  these fractures are arranged through the thickness of the specimens following different geometrical layouts  some of the main features of the fracture propagation processes reported in this work are: initiation of wing cracks and secondary cracks; direction and propagation of the newly generated cracks and patterns of fracture coalescence  the results obtained in the simulations are qualitatively compared with experimental observations reported in the literature  this work is then extended to present results for a larger scale problem wherein fracture coalescence networks are observed when a pre-existing in-situ fracture network is stimulated    1  introduction  rock contains a large number of natural fractures at various scales as the result of a variety of geological processes  a thorough understanding of the cracking initiation, propagation, interaction and eventual coalescence processes emanating from existing in-situ flaws can benefit geological engineering design and implementation [1]  in order to understand the fracture process within brittle solids, horii and nemat-nasser carried out a series of uniaxial compression tests using resin plates that contained artificial pre-existing cracks [2]  following their work, crack coalescence in rock materials has been extensively studied, both experimentally and numerically [3-9]  | 
2015-315 	 fracture testing in modes i, ii, and iii on escabrosa limestone |abstract  an on-going project at the university of arizona is using kartchner caverns in benson, arizona as a natural analog to study time-dependent rock failure with subcritical crack growth modeling  various material properties of the escabrosa limestone composing the caverns are required for input into the damage model  central among these properties are the subcritical crack growth parameters n and a, which can be calculated from modes i, ii, and iii fracture toughness tests conducted at different loading rates  this paper presents the results of modes i, ii, and iii testing on escabrosa limestone, providing the material properties necessary for the larger goal of modeling breakdown in kartchner caverns and applying the model to the long-term stability of rock excavations  additionally, fracture test results are compared with a previous study by tae young ko at the university of arizona, which tested coconino sandstone and determined that the subcritical crack growth parameters were consistent among modes  this study expands upon ko’s work by adding the characterization of a second rock material in all three modes; preliminary results indicate that for escabrosa limestone the subcritical crack growth parameters are not consistent among modes    1  introduction  time-dependent rock failure is an important aspect in the analysis of long-term rock stability for slopes, dam and bridge foundations, and underground storage facilities  under short-term loading, a crack will propagate when the stress intensity factor at the crack tip exceeds a critical value: the fracture toughness  subcritical crack growth is the propagation of a crack at values of the stress intensity factor smaller than the fracture toughness  this type of growth happens under long-term loading and is environmentally-assisted, occurring through mechanisms such as stress corrosion, diffusion, microplasticity, dissolution, and ion exchange [1, 2]  there are three modes of crack tip displacement in critical and subcritical crack growth: mode i (tension), mode ii (in-plane shear), and mode iii (out-of-plane shear) | 
2015-318 	 pickling the gas shale in water or water vapor |abstract  we have been conducting shale research for more than four decades in oilfield as well as coal mines  since late 1960s, our work has dealt with troublesome shale as a source of well bore instability or coal mine roof falls near ventilation shafts  we quickly found that the shale issues must be addressed by simultaneously taking into account the combined chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the shale  to accomplish this, we introduced the thermodynamic properties of the shale based on its specific percentage of clay content  this technique, along with sound and practical petroleum engineering practices, guided us to successfully design the mud systems, tailored for drilling long sections of troublesome shale, and resolve the issues of well bore instability, ultrafine contamination, lost circulation, slow drilling  in addition to considering shale as a source of hazard, since mid 1970s, we have been involved with research that considers shale gas/liquid as a viable economic resource and how to best extract these natural energy resources from shale that could be categorized as “troublesome shale ”   in this work, regarding the recovery of the natural energy resources, we share our recent results and conclusions about the following questions and their significance to both roof control in coal mining and petroleum engineering:  1  shale in contact with water vapor: application to mining engineering, specifically to roof control in coal mining near the ventilation shaft or the main shaft, we answer questions related to interaction of water vapor appearing in ventilation system and shale• is there any water in the gas shale that seemingly appears dry? • how do the micro-fracture networks in shale grow? • at what specific sites do these micro-fracture networks initiate? • why these micro-fractures do not develop in some specimens that have almost the same type and concentration of clay minerals? • what kind of fracture develops in these networks?  2  shale in contact with water: application to petroleum engineering we answer questions dealing with immersion of shale in water: • at what specific sites is the gas stored within the shale mass? • could there be any relationship between the activated sites of “free gas,” which may result in the development of localized “pore pressure” in the “pickled” shale mass and the appearance of the fault within the same specimen? • is the fault appearing in the “pickled” shale specimen strictly a normal fault? • how many types of gas flow behavior can we expect from the “pickled” gas shale? • is the gas flow from the “pickled” gas shale cyclic within a short time or steady over long periods? • for how long, at a minimum, should we shut-in the well after hydraulic fracturing for optimal gas production results?   to answer the above questions we find that we need to understand what shale is before dealing with it as a resource material or control it when it poses engineering issues  | 
2015-324 	 dual-scale modeling of time-dependent damage evolution and failure process of brittle rocks |abstract  a physically-motivated dual-scale modeling approach is proposed to model the time-dependent damage, deformation and fracturing behavior of heterogeneous brittle rocks during creep  the proposed model uses a microcrack-based damage constitutive law established at the elemental scale, in which the time-dependent degradation of elastic stiffness and damage-induced anisotropy are directly linked to microcrack growth  the evolution of mechanical heterogeneity is based on a weibull distribution that captures the transition from distributed damage to localized failure  the key feature of the proposed model is to establish an adequate prediction of macroscopic creep behavior based on the microscopic kinetics of microcrack growth rather than the phenomenological material degradation laws adopted in previously-developed statistical models  the general capabilities of the proposed model are illustrated with numerical simulations of biaxial creep tests  the influence of differential stresses on creep behavior in brittle rocks is also examined  results from such analyses indicate that the proposed model not only accurately replicates the trimodal phases of creep deformation and the associated temporal evolution of acoustic emission but also follows the progressive evolution of fracture modes and morphology commonly observed  thus, subject to suitable calibration, this model provides an attractive virtual experimental tool to probe process-based understanding of complex long-term problems related to structures in geologic media    1  introduction  understanding creep response of rocks in the earth’s crust is but one of many challenges that relate to characterizing natural and engineered processes related to earthquake rupture, the triggering of volcanic eruptions, failure in underground mining, hydrocarbon and geothermal energy recovery and hazardous waste disposal, among others [1]  the modeling of timedependent deformation and fracturing of rocks under creep conditions is fundamental to better assessing the precursory phenomena of geohazards or predicting the long-term stability and safety of engineering facilities | 
2015-329 	 numerical simulations of fracture curving: interaction of two fractures |abstract  during the development of unconventional oil and gas, multi -staged fracturing within horizontal well is used to create several fractures in one stage at one time  during the stimulation operation process, the present fracture will probably connect to the other established fractures in present stage or the former stage, which leads to hydraulic fractures difficult to effectively spread  a hydraulic fracture influences the extending direction of other fractures, namely, causing certain attraction or repulsion effect  in this paper, finite element calculation is made to simulate the interaction of fractures with different spacing and lengths  the results show that when the two fractures are extending in the same pace, the interaction will gradually change from repulsion to attraction with the spacing of two fractures getting closer  on the other hand, when the two fractures both are extending but not synchronously, both fractures will curve towards the side of the shorter fracture if the spacing is relatively small compared to the fractures’ length  in addition, an already formed fracture will attract a newborn fracture at a short distance, but repel it at a longer distance  based on the calculation above, guidance can be provided for optimization of fracture distributions for multi -staged fracturing treatments    1  introduction  during the development of unconventional oil and gas, multi -staged fracturing within horizontal well is used to create several fractures in one stage at one time  during the stimulation operation process, the present fracture will probably connect to the other established fractures in present stage or the former stage, which leads to hydraulic fractures difficult to effectively spread  a hydraulic fracture influences the extending direction of other fractures, namely, causing certain attraction or repulsion effect  in this paper, finite element calculation is made to simulate the interaction of fractures with different spacing and lengths  the results show that when the two fractures are extending in the same pace, the interaction will gradually change from repulsion to attraction with the spacing of two fractures getting closer  on the other hand, when the two fractures both are extending but not synchronously, both fractures will curve towards the side of the shorter fracture if the spacing is relatively small compared to the fractures’ length  in addition, an already formed fracture will attract a newborn fracture at a short distance, but repel it at a longer distance  based on the calculation above, guidance can be provided for optimization of fracture distributions for multi -staged fracturing treatments  |

2015-333 	 real time stability evaluation of large underground powerhouse caverns - application of microseismics |abstract  large underground powerhouse caverns in the mighty himalayan region during construction and their operation after their completion experiencing instabilities, which are need to be monitored for life time using a real time regional monitoring systems for the safety of the structure, installed machinery and workmen  these structures experienced many incidents of strata instabilities during construction period including large roof falls and even during its operation in the form of large number of rockbolt violent failures etc  since the conventional instrumentation that was installed during construction was not able to provide adequate information about the regional stability  a high resolution sixty channel real time, remote monitoring microseismic system was established in one of the project site with the objective to provide information related to the regional strata behaviour in real time and to address the regional structural and strata stability around the powerhouse caverns  the microseismic data is continuously recorded, auto processed and displayed in near real time at the central data recording laboratory situated inside the underground powerhouse and at regional data processing centers located far away from the site    the microseismic data acquired were analyzed and mapped on the 3d plan of the caverns  statistical data analysis using source parameters of microseismic events were carried out to correlate the events with rock bolt failures in order to study the signatures of the precursory signals  few microseismic events occurred in clusters at some regions and majority of the microseismic events have the local magnitudes in the range of at about -2 5  the range of recorded events local magnitudes indicates that the cavern was stable during the monitoring period, there is no development of stress pockets or migration (changes in stress) of stress regime  the changes in the stress have been very low indicating the stability of the strata  the recorded low values show the efficiency of the monitoring system in response to minor changes of strata behaviour    this paper presents the real time microseismic monitoring of regional strata behaviour of the underground hydro powerhouse caverns for about a period of one and half year after the commissioning of real time monitoring system in september 2013 and correlation of microseismic activity to explain the rock bolt failures and the caverns regional strata stability  | 
2015-337 	 influence of microcrack parameters on splitting failure of roadway under high stress |abstract  a dual-scale modeling approach is proposed to model splitting failure zone in surrounding rock of roadway  compared with previous models, our model has three innovative points: first, closure effect of pre-existing fracture is considered; second, hyperbolic equation is utilized to describe the path of wing crack propagation which is more closed to reality  third, representative elemental volumes are adopted to tackle the damage localization  the new model is applied to investigate the influence of microcrack parameters on the depth and area of splitting failure zone  this study can be realized due to the implementation of representative elemental volumes  results show that: with the increase of microcrack length, the depth and area of splitting failure in surrounding rock become lager; with the increase of initial angle, the depth and area of splitting failure in surrounding rock increase first and then decrease, tend to zero finally  when the initial angle is equal to 45°, the depth and area of splitting failure reach a maximum value  when the initial angle is approaching 90°, microcracks form self-locking, splitting failure is significantly inhibited; with the increase of friction coefficient, depth and area of splitting failure are gradually reduced and finally tend to 0    1  introduction  in china, coal demand increases rapidly due to the rapid economic development  this situation leads to exhausting of shallow coal resources, meanwhile buried depth of mines become larger  the buried depth of some coal mines are even greater than 1000m, such as zhangxiaolou coal mine, jiahe coal mine, zhangji coal mine et al  the openings of these coal mines are in high initial stress  during excavating the openings under high initial stress, a large range of splitting failure zones were always observed  this kind of phenomenon has been the experience [1]  splitting failure always causes the equipment damage, project delay, economic losses  therefore establishing the splitting failure model play a key role in stability evaluation of deep surrounding rocks and the proper supporting design for openings | 
2015-341 	 filter cake behavior during leakage at the cement-rock interface in wellbores |abstract  a 3d visualization procedure based on micro computed tomography data revealed potential leak paths along the cement-rock interface  the rock-cement bonding was seen to clearly decrease with the presence of drilling fluid/filter cake  the core flooding experiments showed a correlation between the dimensions of interface micro-annuli and measured co2 flow  however, unpredictable fluid migration was also observed – underlining the importance of understanding how drilling fluid and filter cake behave when subjected to downhole pressures  the results show the importance of updating well integrity procedures for co2 storage wells in order to manage the risk of ccs projects  our work shows the integrity of zonal isolation provided by annular and plug cement is difficult to achieve and that modeling with ideal assumptions on leak path shape and properties should be avoided    1  introduction  a properly designed and constructed well should have zonal isolation; meaning no detectable fluid migration across zones with different pressures  a simplified description of a petroleum well is a wellbore with steel casing(s) placed inside it  cement is placed in the annulus between the casing and wellbore wall to mechanically support the casing, and to prevent migration of fluids from the reservoir  over the years of petroleum production, the combination of hands-on experience and research has improved the understanding of cement as a material [1], and the procedures to prevent loss of zonal isolation [2]  careful cement slurry preparation and use of spacers [3, 4], reciprocating/rotation of casing and casing centralization [5, 6, 7, 8], and control of the flow regime and fluid rheology [9] are some of the many important factors to increase the success rate  | 
2015-342 	 investigating the evolution of polygonal fault systems using geomechanical forward modeling |abstract  polygonal faults are thought to potentially compromise the integrity of regional caprocks and are widely developed in mudrocks that are targeted for unconventionals exploration  polygonal fault systems (pfs) contain networks of exclusively normal faults that intersect bedding planes at a wide variety of azimuths  this fact alone suggests a non-tectonic origin and recent arguments focus on a constitutive control on pfs formation  geomechanical forward modelling has the potential to shed light on the evolution of material and stress state as geological structures form  the evolution of polygonal faults is studied here using the finite strain forward modelling code elfen fm  more specifically the recently suggested diagenetic trigger for pfs formation is investigated, and the process of incorporating this into a critical-state based model is outlined and discussed  the results demonstrate the formation of pfs in both 2d plane-strain and full 3d simulations as validation of both the genetic argument and the computational approach  pfs are additionally observed to be sensitive to subtle horizontal stress anisotropy e g  around salt diapirs or larger tectonic faults  as such, there is the potential for these fault networks to act as ‘paleo-stress piezometers’  this study investigates this by incorporating subtle stress anisotropy into the model and observing the influence on fault alignment  results indicate that even for subtle stress anisotropy, preferential fault alignment is observed and this is consistent with observation    1  introduction  the controls on the formation of polygonal fault systems (pfs) remain poorly understood and are still widely debated, despite having been studied for over two decades  these unusual networks of normal faults, which are confined to specific stratigraphic intervals termed ‘tiers’, have been identified on seismic data from over 100 basins worldwide and frequently cover vast areas [1]  the presence of these faults on passive continental margins and particularly basin floors, where regional dips are close to zero, is curious as it implies that they must have formed in regions of low tectonic activity  hence, the presence of shear failures in what are inferred to be essentially k0 conditions (zero lateral strain) is counter-intuitive  the confinement to tiers coupled with the suggestion that tectonic forces have minimal influence is strongly indicative of a constitutive control on the formation of pfs  understanding the nature of pfs and the mechanism(s) by which they form is important as all known examples discovered to date are exclusively found in very fine-grained sediments which in some cases form the areal caprock  therefore, there is the potential for pfs to act as a ‘seal bypass’ [2], and hence they have implications for subsurface fluid migration and therefore hydrocarbon exploration [3]  additionally, the presence of pfs in the shallow subsurface means that they may present a drilling hazard and compromise efforts aimed at recovery of hydrocarbons  finally, it has been noted that pfs are often sensitive to subtle horizontal stress anisotropy induced by tectonic faults, slopes or salt diapirs  | 
2015-345 	 effect of rheology on drilling mud loss in a natural fracture |abstract  circulation loss is a major issue while drilling through naturally fractured reservoirs  quantitative prediction of the drilling mud loss is therefore critically needed for the control of lost circulation  while it is usually assumed that steady-state rheology of a drilling mud can be described by a yield stress and power law shear thinning, it is not uncommon that a drilling mud exhibits newtonian or even shear thickening behaviors in the high shear rate range (shear rate <ed><u+00a0><u+00b5><ed><u+00bb><u+00be> > 1000 1/s)  high shear rate rheology governs fluid flow behaviors at early time and is therefore critical to control of lost circulation  in this work, effect of rheology, in particular, the high shear rate rheology, on drilling mud loss in a single natural fracture is investigated  a piecewise rheological model incorporating a yield stress and power laws for both the low shear rate and high shear rate is employed  the natural fracture is assumed to be nearly perpendicular to the wellbore and is initially closed  the problem formulated is solved numerically using an explicit moving mesh algorithm  effects of the rheological parameters and the leakoff coefficient on the mud loss behaviors are analyzed   1  introduction  severe lost circulation is a common contributor to the nonproductive time in drilling, in particular in naturally fractured reservoirs  lost circulation may also cause significant issues in subsequent well completion and reservoir production  quantitative prediction of the drilling mud loss in a natural fracture is therefore critical for selecting prevention and remedial strategies to control lost circulation  meanwhile, real-time monitoring of the mud loss in overbalance drilling has commonly been employed as a diagnostic tool for formation characterization [1-3]   various theoretical models for mud invasion in a single isolated natural fracture have been developed in the literature to solve for the natural fracture permeability based on the mud loss log data [e g , 4-8]  the basic elements in these theoretical models include assumptions for the fracture orientation and geometry, the fracture deformation law, the leakoff behavior, whether the fracture length is finite or infinite, and whether flow along the fracture is transient or steady state  drilling mud is generally assumed to be a single-phase fluid with non-newtonian rheological characteristics such as yield stress and power law shear thinning, e g , rheology of herschel-bulkley type [9]  extension of these models to include the shut-in phase also allows investigation of various mud or formation fluid flow scenarios [10]  | 
2015-347 	 numerical modelling of casing integrity in salt layers including the effects of dissolution and creep |abstract  this paper presents a methodology to analyze the casing integrity in salt layers considering the effects of creep and dissolution on the wellbore closure  the finite element software abaqus was adopted to perform the simulations  the dissolution was considered homogeneous and inhomogeneous through a function that turns off the elements located on the wellbore  the progress of material removal obeys to the characteristic dissolution curve of rock salt considered, and the creep was analyzed with a power law function, available in the abaqus library  four cases have been studied: a) wellbore creep without dissolution, b) homogeneous dissolution of the entire wellbore, c) partial dissolution of the wellbore and, d) homogeneous dissolution considering casing decentralization  the results show that the dissolution may slow the contact of the salt with the casing whenever it is homogeneous  for the condition of inhomogeneity point loads can be generated by increasing the stresses on the casing, causing the potential pipe collapse, in addition to modeling time around 5 years, numerical problems are presented due to the high distortions of the elements finite mesh being necessary to use adaptive remeshing techniques to treat such problems    1  introduction  large oil fields were discovered on the brazil coast (santos basin) in 2007, in a geological formation known as pre-salt  in the pre-salt region, the depth of water varies between 1000-2000 meters thickness and the seabed varies between 4 000-6 000 meters  thus, the total depth of the reservoirs below the salt layer can reach 8 000 meters  the figure 1 shows one example of an oil reservoir in the pre-salt region  |one of the main challenges to cross the salt layers is to ensure the casing integrity because these wells are drilled in complex geological formations, both in the geometric aspect as the mechanical behavior  there are two main effects that can be emphasized: 1) the dissolution of the salt rock due to drilling fluid and 2) the creep after drilling  these effects have opposite results, while the dissolution increases the diameter of the wellbore, the creep decreases it | 
2015-348 	 strategies for forward modeling the evolution of geological structures undergoing large deformation |abstract  modeling the evolution of geological structures from deposition through to the current day can provide useful insight, such as better knowledge of the stress and material state evolution, development of overpressures, thermal history, and timings related to the maturation of hydrocarbons  this paper discussions one method of simulating the evolution of various structures via a quasi-static explicit adaptive finite element framework that is adopted based on a lagrangian description of the kinematics and uses the forward modeling software elfen fm   the large strains encountered in many cases lead to scenarios of extreme layer thinning and suitable automated strategies for mitigating the impact of such cases on the quality of the solution are critical  therefore, this paper focuses on this computational modeling topic and via conceptual examples the capabilities of the methodology are demonstrated    1  introduction  forward modeling technology has the ability to capture the development of geological structures at local or regional scales from deposition through to current day  this has the potential to provide exploration teams with useful geomechanical insight, particularly regarding potential stress and material state in reservoir units and adjacent layers, and regions of developed overpressures  such information may be of significant benefit in terms of outlining potential strategies for field development and may be critical to the recovery of both conventional and unconventional resources  for example, recent studies have highlighted differences in the magnitudes of stresses adjacent to salt structures when they were analyzed using conventional static e g  as used in [1], and forward modeling approaches [2]  additionally, folding studies in the caspian using forward modeling software detailed in this paper has yielded promising results both in terms of matching the structural style and accurately recovering pore pressure distributions [3]  | 
2015-349 	 a framework for wellbore cement integrity analysis |abstract  steel casings are cemented in wellbores to ensure that the production of oil and gas can be controlled during the operation of the well and at the well-bore end of life  the sealing properties of the cement are essential in this respect  loading history during construction and operation of the well and long-term material behavior characteristics may affect the integrity of the cement and its sealing capacity  several failure potential modes are identified: cracking of cement, shear failure of cement, debonding of cement and casing and de-bonding of cement and rock  in this paper a nonlinear, staggered, heat-transfer-stress analysis for both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional models is presented  the analysis simulates and evaluates the sealing properties of the cement and calculates the chance that one or more of the failure modes occurs  in the analysis both the construction phases of the well and typical loadings during operation, such as over-pressures and temperature changes, as well as abandonment phase, are considered  some examples of numerical models are presented and discussed   1  introduction and objective  different types of cement are available such as:  • conventional cement, with a relatively high stiffness, showing a significant level of shrinkage during hardening,   • cements with additives such as rubber, being more flexible with a small level of shrinkage, and  • expanding cements  for unstable boreholes, or in wells located in rock with strong anisotropic stress conditions, or in wells which are exposed to strong variations of temperature or pressure in the well, more flexible cements with limited shrinkage or expanding cements are required to ensure the integrity of the cement during the life of the well  the market-price of cements however, with additives for expanding cement, is considerably higher than conventional cements and so there is a need to quantify the necessary cement properties to suit specific well-conditions | 
2015-351 	 pore pressure estimation in a tight sand reservoir: neuquen basin, case study |abstract  standard methods to predict pore pressure rely on the assumption that under-compaction is the only mechanism for overpressure generation  for conventional plays, this assumption may be held since the weight of the overlying sediments is supported partly by the rock matrix and partly by the confined interstitial fluids, resulting in an overpressured formation  in a tight gas sand reservoir, it becomes necessary to check the methodologies to predict pore pressure, since the source of overpressure is not clear and the absence of a thick mudrock layer does not allow to find trends of preserved porosity in fine layers  this paper shows a workflow to generate a pore pressure model at reservoir scale in a tight gas sand reservoir  sonic logs, density logs and dfit data of around 50 wells were used to correlate the porosity with the vertical effective stress (ves), which is the difference between the overburden and the pore pressure    1  introduction  in the last five years, unconventional reservoirs in argentina, particularly in the neuquen basin, have been intensively developed, mainly for the needs to have new sources of hydrocarbons to supplement the production of the already exploited conventional reservoirs    the difficulties encountered to develop these plays, justify the need to get new and more accurate reservoir data, to revise the methods traditionally used, and to analyze reservoirs from a different perspective  for example, the mechanical behavior of reservoirs started to play a key role in their development, especially at the drilling and stimulation stages    among the geomechanical variables that play a fundamental role in the reservoir development, an accurate pore pressure prediction is fundamental to execute a safe drilling strategy, to accurately perform a production forecast and modelling, and also to establish the stress state, which sets the behavior of the hydraulic fracture  | 
2015-352 	 a finite element geomechanical study of the brittle failure of a caprock due to deflation |abstract  the deformation of an initially intact caprock, due to the depletion of an underlying reservoir during oil extraction, is geomechanically modeled in three dimensions using a fully coupled poro-elastic model, incorporating plastic damage and fracture models in the caprock  fractures are represented explicitly in an arbitrary tetrahedral mesh  an isotropic damage model accounts for micro-fracture growth in response to the accumulation of plastic strain  stress intensity factors, computed using the reduced virtual integration technique, assess potential fracture growth by measuring energy concentrations around the tips  the objectives are to evaluate the locations in the caprock, where damage and fracture propagation are most likely to occur  as a result of poro-elastic deformation during the onset of reservoir depletion, shear driven damage in fractures above and around the well are observed  extension driven growth is observed in fractures located away from the well  damage and fracture growth both potentially decrease the caprock integrity, and locally enhance the permeability    1  introduction  co2 sequestration at industrial scales is a potentially a viable long-term pathway to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations  such a solution relies on the ability to effectively trap co2 within saline aquifers or oil reservoirs over hundreds or thousands of years, without leakage  the reservoir caprock is an important trapping mechanism which should help ensure that the greenhouse gas remains underground  caprocks are low permeability rocks, typically shale or anhydrites, which lie on top of the reservoir and mechanically prevent fluids from migrating towards the surface  caprocks are geological features that have formed over millions of years, and therefore contain a variety of heterogeneities including natural fractures and faults  if reactivated, these fractures and faults could potentially become conduits for fluid to flow to the surface, jeopardizing the effective integrity of the caprock  however, for a caprock to be eligible for co2 injection, it must have kept its integrity during oil extraction  |

2015-360 	 on poroelastic inclusions and its applications in reservoir mechanics |abstract  geological structures in the subsurface ranging from fractures to reservoirs can be simplified as ellipsoidal inhomogeneities  for instance, one can model a reservoir as an inclusion by considering possibly different material properties and different fluid pressure in comparison to the surrounding rock  hence, the stresses and displacements associated with the fluid withdrawal from or fluid injection into the formations can be determined by assuming no hydraulic communication between the inclusion and the surrounding medium  the lack of hydraulic communication could be the result of a cap rock or an impermeable seal/fault  on other hand, in the case of fractures, this assumption in not valid anymore and the hydraulic communication between the inclusion and medium should be considered in the calculations  this paper provides analytical solutions for deformation and stress distribution inside and outside of poroelastic ellipsoidal inclusions  eshelby theory with the biot theory of poroelasticity are combined to model the change in stress caused by changes in pore pressure or temperature inside the inclusions  using the provided analytical solutions, we explore the effect of inclusion size, material properties and pressure/temperature condition  the results confirm that neglecting hydraulic communication between the inclusion and the sounding matrix may result in lower inclusion volume change ratio associated with mode (1) and higher inclusion volume change ratio associated with mode (2)    1  introduction  despite considerable advances in numerical modeling of subsurface engineering problems, there is still a need for analytical solutions as a benchmark for numerical models as well as a quick resort to approximate solutions  due to the nature of numerical techniques, boundary effects and discretization error may easily occur in any basic modelling efforts  eshelby’s equivalent inclusion theory is recognized as one of the most powerful techniques for deriving analytical solutions for many elasticity problems, however, this techniques has not yet widely utilized for poroelastic problems  presence of pore fluid in the porous materials and its coupling with material deformations leads to different class of material behaviors known as poroelastic behavior  | 
2015-362 	 characterization of mechanical properties of rocks using numerical simulations and image analysis |abstract  determining mechanical properties of reservoir rocks through mechanical testing is a well-established procedure  static properties obtained from these tests (young's modulus, poisson's ratio, ucs, etc ) are fundamental to calibrate both 1d geomechanical models (well-scale) and complex 3d models (reservoir-scale)  these mechanical lab tests have the disadvantage of being destructive, making it impossible to obtain large amounts of data and limiting the generation of geomechanical reservoir models  in this context, numerical simulations of laboratory tests can be a good alternative to obtain mechanical properties of rock without the expensive destructive testing    in this paper, we present a methodology based on numerical simulations and image analysis (thin sections and/or micrographs of cores) to model the mechanical properties from brazilian tests simulations  the developed methodology reproduces in the simulator the mineralogy, the texture and the structure of the rock to improve the understanding of the distribution of the mechanical properties of the formations  the results are in good agreement with mechanical lab tests    1  introduction  in the last few decades, unconventional reservoirs have been intensively developed after proving its economic feasibility  among them, tight sands and shale formations have been exploited    those reservoirs have the characteristic of having very low matrix permeability (well below 1md), and need to be massively fractured to generate high conductivity channels, to connect preexisting fractures to the well and/or facilitate hydrocarbon flow from the rock matrix    the performance of those wells depends on the quality of the intended hydraulic fracture, which behavior is strongly affected by the mechanical properties of the rock  for that reason, traditional mechanical tests, such as the brazilian, tri-axial, etc , have become standard in the oil and gas industry, to characterize reservoir rocks mechanical properties [1]  |

2015-364 	 qualifying stress direction from borehole shear sonic anisotropy |abstract  a method is presented to qualify the maximum horizontal stress direction on basis of dipole shear sonic anisotropy in near-vertical wellbores  the proposed scheme follows a similar qualification standard to that used for stress observations on the basis of image logs and four-arm caliper logs in the world stress map project  image log analysis and shear wave anisotropy analysis will often complement one another and add confidence when both are observed  the combination of geological setting and rock properties, together with drilling practices, does not always result in clear borehole failure, limiting the ability to quantify stress direction from images alone  shear sonic anisotropy is often able to identify horizontal stress imbalance where borehole failure has yet not occurred  herein, we review the methodology to determine stress direction on the basis of dipole borehole sonic data, including examination of the effect of hole ovality  the use of slowness frequency dispersion curves is particularly important, as dispersion curve analysis is essential for distinguishing shear sonic anisotropy due to horizontal differential stresses from that caused by lithological fabric and natural fractures   1  introduction  borehole dipole (flexural) sonic waves provide the opportunity to identify and quantify shear anisotropy  the dipole flexural waves polarize into a fast and slow shear in the presence of elastic anisotropy in the planes containing the borehole axis  anisotropy may be the result of mechanical anisotropy, fractures, or stress  slowness-dispersion analysis provides the ability to identify stress-induced azimuthal anisotropy  if anisotropy is confirmed to be a result of a differential stress, one can then determine the direction of maximum horizontal stress from the direction of the fast shear wave in a near-vertical wellbore [1, 2, 3, 4]  this technique is commonly used in the petroleum industry for complementing other methods, such as borehole failure measured from calipers and images, to deduce the direction and magnitude of the present-day horizontal stresses  stress characterization methods that rely on the presence of borehole failure using images are limited to boreholes that exhibit failure  similarly there are situations where high differential stresses are observed from borehole failure and yet shear wave anisotropy is absent  theory and laboratory testing illustrate that all rocks have some degree of acoustic sensitivity to changes in stress, which is related to the compliance of the grain-to-grain contacts  in the borehole, this phenomenon is also limited by the accuracy of acoustic logging technology [30]  these data are then used for future geomechanics-related studies for predicting sand production, planning stimulation treatments, reservoir engineering, and wellbore stability [6, 7, and 8] | 
2015-366 	 wellbore stability modeling with a grain-based rock model |abstract  a grain-based rock model was developed and applied to study wellbore stability  the rock is represented as an assembly of tetrahedral blocks with bonded contacts  material heterogeneity is modeled by varying the tensile strength at the block contacts  this grain-based rock model differs from previous disk/sphere particle-based rock models (e g , potyondy and cundall, [1]) in its ability to represent a zero (or very low) initial porosity condition, as well as highly interlocked irregular block shapes that provide resistance to movement even after contact breakage  as a result, this model can reach higher uniaxial compressive strength to tensile strength ratios and larger friction coefficients than the disk/sphere particle-based rock model    the model was first used to match the properties of typical rocks (such as sandstone) by simulating the direct tension test and uniaxial compression test  the calibrated model was then applied to study wellbore breakout and the thick-walled cylinder (twc) test  the model captured the fragmentation process near the wellbore due to buckling and spalling  thin fragments of rock similar to onion skins were produced, as observed in laboratory breakout experiments (e g , haimson, [2])  the results suggest that this approach may be well-suited to study the rock disaggregation process and other geomechanical problems in the oil and gas industry    1  introduction  wellbore stability is required to recover oil and gas resources safely  wellbores can fail via several mechanisms, including stress-related failures such as breakout and tensile failure, subsidence (depletion), fault activation due to production, and complex geologic conditions    image logs have been used extensively (barton and zoback, [3]) to observe and investigate wellbore failures, and numerical modeling has been used for several decades to predict and simulate wellbore failures  the history of numerical methods for borehole stability has been presented by salehi et al  [4]  in the late 1980s and early 1990s, several linear elastic and poroelastic models for borehole stability were introduced by bradley [5], detournay and cheng [6], fuh et al  [7], and yew and lui [8]  in the 1990s, nonlinear elastic, plastic and elasto-plastic models were developed by mclean and addis [9], mclellan and wang [10], and mclellan [11]  several thermo- and chemo-poroelastic models were also developed by li et al  [12], wang and dusseault [13] and others  although more complex material behavior was modeled in the later models, all of the aforementioned models were two-dimensional  | 
2015-367 	 fundamental investigation of gas injection in microfluidic shale fracture networks at geologic conditions |abstract  we present a unique microfluidics experimental system that uses geo-material (rock) micromodels and accommodates pressures and temperatures that are encountered in many fossil fuel operations  this system allows us to investigate a wide variety of fluid flow, transport, and chemistry processes that cannot be addressed with experiments at ambient conditions using typical micromodel materials (e g , glass, silicon)  we describe the experimental system in detail, including our versatile micromodel fabrication method that works for a variety of geo- and engineered materials  we present a shale fracture-matrix interaction experiment that shows the importance of imbibition in these systems  additionally, we present a series of immiscible displacement experiments conducted in shale and glass involving supercritical-co2 and water  the experiments and discussion highlight the advantages of using rock micromodels for applications involving fossil fuel operations   1  introduction  micromodels have proven to be effective tools for quantifying flow and transport phenomena in complex porous media [1, 2]  the vast majority of micromodels consist of idealized, thin porous structures etched into engineered materials (e g , glass, plastic, silicon) in which flow and transport is restricted to two-dimensions [1]  combined with advanced imaging techniques, microfluidic investigations provide real-time, pore-scale quantification of fluid, interfacial, and mass transfer dynamics - information that is otherwise largely inaccessible in other experimental systems    microfluidic flow investigations have the potential to play a large role in future energy resource technologies, especially those related to fossil fuels [3]  operations associated with fossil fuel production are largely considered reservoir-scale problems, ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers  however, the fluid flow and transport processes of interest occur within the pores and fractures of rock that are nanometers to millimeters in size, making microfluidics an ideal method for identifying key flow physics that accurately explain reservoir-scale observables  | 
2015-374 	 use of microseismic monitoring data as an aid to rock mechanics decision making and mine design verification |abstract  case studies are presented from glencores’ fraser copper, fraser morgan and nickel rim south mines showing how microseismic monitoring data can be used as an aid to rock mechanics decision making and design verification  at nickel rim south and fraser morgan, examples of how recorded development blasts can be used to quickly evaluate source location accuracy and infer the state of rockmass conditions are given  examples are given as to how network sensitivity can enhance the understanding of the rockmass response to mining are also presented and a case is made for 3d velocity models and recognizing the impact of waveform attenuation from raypath effects, and yielded rockmass conditions  at fraser copper, a case history shows how seismic information was useful for evaluating the performance of a successful longhole destress blast that was performed when face-bursting was encountered during a planned underhand extraction of a highly stressed remnant    1  introduction  glencore’s sudbury integrated nickel operations includes three underground operations, the nickel rim south mine, fraser copper mine, and fraser morgan mine, all located near sudbury, ontario, canada (figure 1)    fraser morgan is a nickel deposit accessed via the fraser copper mine infrastructure  close to 2 million tonnes per year of ore are mined underground from all operations, with nickel rim south providing the majority of the material at 1 3 mt/year    all three operations are hard rock mines, with excellent rockmass quality  the depth of mining is sufficient to develop pervasive stress fracturing around most openings (figure 2) | 
2015-375 	 surface subsidence induced by hydrocarbons extraction, and the potential for time-dependent ground deformations |abstract  pore pressure reduction due to hydrocarbon extraction from gas reservoirs causes compaction of the reservoir rock accompanied by a redistribution of stresses in the surrounding rock mass, leading to sub-surface deformations and surface subsidence  there is evidence to suggest that the induced sub-surface movements in some of the netherlands’ gas fields (the motivation behind the study) are time-varying  the sandstone reservoirs in question are overlain by relatively thick layers of rocksalt, which flows viscoelastically when shear stress are applied to it  for this reason, rocksalt flow has been proposed as a mechanism to explain the observed time-dependence  the work reported here aims to understand the mechanisms by which viscoelastic rocksalt flow can cause surface displacements and to assess whether the magnitude of the resulting displacements can be significant over timescales similar to those observed in the field  finite element analyses of idealized reservoir geometries and simplified geological models will be employed for this purpose, with the aim of avoiding complexities that can mask the underlying processes and phenomena  results here indicate that salt-driven flow has the potential of inducing significant timedependent subsidence, in excess to the ones calculated through solely elastic analyses of the same problem  they therefore indicate that in cases where accurate subsidence predictions are essential, salt has to be modeled accurately    1  introduction  extraction of natural gas from a reservoir rock formation leads to pore-fluid pressure decrease and so an effective stress increase in the reservoir rock  this in turn leads to reservoir compaction which is registered at the surface as subsidence  the link between production-induced pore pressure changes at the reservoir level and surface subsidence is well-established, e g  [1, 2, 3, 4]   in many cases the ground is modelled as elastic and so an immediate subsidence response to the pore pressure reduction is expected at the surface (after [5, 6])  this thinking therefore assumes that subsidence stops immediately after the stop of production from a reservoir  however there is growing evidence to suggest that for some reservoirs there is a delay in the subsidence response, i e  a time-dependence of ground deformations, see [7, 8]  | 
2015-376 	 helium-mass-spectrometry-permeameter for the measurement of permeability of low permeability rock with application to triaxial deformation conditions |abstract  a helium leakage detection system was modified to measure gas permeability on extracted cores of nearly impermeable rock  here we use a helium - mass - spectrometry - permeameter (hmsp) to conduct a constant pressure, steady state flow test through a sample using helium gas  under triaxial stress conditions, the hmsp can measure flow and estimate permeability of rocks and geomaterials down to the nanodarcy scale (10-21m2)  in this study, measurements of flow through eight shale samples under hydrostatic conditions were in the range of 10-7to 10-9darcy  we extend this flow measurement technology by dynamically monitoring the release of helium from a helium saturated shale sample during a triaxial deformation experiment  the helium flow, initially extremely low, consistent with the low permeability of shale, is observed to increase in advance of volume strain increase during deformation of the shale  this is perhaps the result of microfracture development and flow path linkage through the microfractures within the shale  once microfracturing coalescence initiates, there is a large increase in helium release and flow  this flow rate increase is likely the result of development of a macrofracture in the sample, a flow conduit, later confirmed by post-test observations of the deformed sample  the release rate (flow) peaks and then diminishes slightly during subsequent deformation; however the post deformation flow rate is considerably greater than that of undeformed shale   1  introduction  understanding fluid flow in shale and or mudstone may prove important if that rock were to be considered as an extensive seal in a co2 storage scenario, as a top seal in an oil and gas reservoir, or similarly as the closure barrier in a compressed air energy storage reservoir  in the above “applications” the low shale permeability is relied upon to create a flow barrier  it is reasonable then to study the flow characteristics of shale at reservoir conditions, and conditions where geologic and manmade conditions may have prompted the rock to fracture  we are studying a different method to measure flow, and estimate shale permeability; we are also, as an extension of that method, determining helium release during shale deformation | 
2015-382 	 acoustic wavefront imaging of orthogonal fracture networks subjected to bi-axial loading |abstract  steeply dipping fractures and horizontally oriented stylolites occur in carbonate reservoirs and lead to the formation of orthogonal fracture networks  interpretation of elastic waves propagated through orthogonal fracture networks is complicated because of the potential existence of guided modes along and between fractures, multiple internal reflections, as well as scattering from fracture intersections  the existence of some or all of these potentially overlapping modes depends on the local stress field that can preferentially close or open either one or both sets of fractures  for this study, an acoustic wavefront imaging system was used to examine the effect of bi-axial loading conditions on acoustic wave propagation in isotropic media with two orthogonal fracture sets  from the experimental data, guided wave behavior was affected by fracture spacing and fracture specific stiffnesses  the fracture stiffness differed among the fractures in the two sets and also differed from the stiffness of the intersections  interpretation of the properties of fractures or fracture sets must consider the existence of non-uniform fracture stiffness within and among fracture sets, as well as consider the effect of fracture intersections    1  introduction  natural fractures are ubiquitous and play key roles in ground-water hydrology [1-3], construction of subsurface facilities [4], hydrocarbon resources exploration and production [5-8], earthquake precaution [9, 10] and nuclear waste sequestration [11]  in carbonate reservoirs, steeply dipping fractures are the most common type that are a result of imbalanced vertical and horizontal stresses [12]  on the other hand, horizontally-oriented or strike-perpendicular fracture/joints are also frequently observed [12, 13]  the major causes of the formation of strike-perpendicular fracture/joints are either pressure dissolution of mineral material in rocks (which forms horizontally-oriented stylolites [14, 15]) or stress rotation mechanisms [16] that results in orthogonal cross-joints in many geological sites  | 
2015-384 	 dynamic rupture modeling of injection-induced seismicity: influence of pressure diffusion below porous aquifers |abstract  seismicity induced by pore pressure increases poses a major hazard for many fluid injection operations, such as waste water injection, secondary recovery of hydrocarbons and co2 storage  diffusion of fluids outside of the target injection formation through relatively permeable faults may especially induce large seismic events, often below the reservoir in the crystalline basement  understanding the mechanisms of seismic events induced under these circumstances is the key for hazard predictions and mitigation measures  in this study we model a simplified pressure diffusion scenario and use dynamic rupture modeling to study the nucleation and propagation of seismic events due to injection-induced pressure changes  in particular, we study the influence of the shape of the pressure diffusion profile on the dynamic characteristics of rupture  we find that high pressure gradients are more likely to cause smaller events, whereas low pressure gradients cause slip over a much larger portion of the fault, with a slightly higher slip rate  in addition, we analyze the influence of the background stress and the friction drop on the fault on the fault rupture    1  introduction  human-induced pore pressure increases in subsurface aquifers/reservoirs can cause fault reactivation, which is undesirable because (i) it may damage the sealing capacity of the caprock faults, which is of particular importance for the integrity of co2 storage sites in the case of large-scale co2 injection [1,2] and (ii) it may cause felt seismicity, which has posed an especially large problem in the us over the past decade in relationship to waste water injection [e g  3]  in this study we aim to gain better understanding on when to expect fault reactivation due to injection into porous aquifers/reservoirs, and in particular what controls the magnitude and dynamic characteristics of induced seismic events   there are multiple mechanisms that can induce fault reactivation during fluid injection into porous aquifers: (i) fluid pressure changes in faults lower the normal effective stress, and bring faults closer to failure; (ii) fluid pressure induced volume changes cause poroelastic stressing of the aquifer and its surroundings; (iii) cooling and contraction of the rock which also stresses the surrounding; and (iv) mineral reactions that change fault shear strength  here we focus on the pressure related effects, i e  poro-elastic stress changes and direct pressure effects in faults  seismicity observed in relationship to secondary recovery (i e  a low pressure injection of water in a reservoir to stimulate oil production after primary production has declined) and in particular large scale waste water injection into permeable aquifers/reservoirs often takes place outside/underneath the target injection layer [4]  in case of basal aquifers (aquifers overlying the basement) seismicity often takes place in the crystalline basement  the inferred mechanism for this seismicity is fluid diffusion into the basement through relatively permeable faults [5]  if the basement is critically stressed, only small pore pressure perturbations may be enough to induce seismicity [6]  understanding what controls the magnitude of these diffusion related events is the key for assessment of seismic hazard and the development of mitigation measures  | 
2015-388 	 numerical modeling of single cutter tests in carbonates |abstract  this paper presents the results of numerical modeling through finite element method and discrete element method for single cutter drilling in carbonate samples  this work is relevant to understand the mechanics of drill bit – rock interaction while drilling deep wells and the results behavior were validated with experimental data raised under simulated downhole conditions  triaxial confining tests were carried out in cylindrical samples of the same carbonate rock used in the cutting experiments  the results were used to create a virtual rock to be utilized by both the discrete and finite element methods  the numerical models were carried out under different geometrical configurations, varying the cutter chamfer size and back-rake angles  the forces generated on the cutter are translated into mechanical specific energy, mse as this parameter is often used to measure drilling efficiency  results indicate that the chamfer size does not change significantly the mse values, although the cutter aggressiveness is influenced by this geometrical characteristic  results also show there is a significant increase in drilling resistance for larger values of back-rake angle   1  introduction  the drilling optimization depends on a detailed evaluation process of the cutter behavior during the rock cutting  through single cutter tests, the effects of geometrical variations in the cutter can be evaluated from the point of view of forces and energy  the possibility of assessing these phenomena numerically, through triaxial calibrations of complex models, significantly expands the spectrum of rock drilling optimization process    the mechanical interaction among the numerical sample and the cutter is evaluated in terms of mechanical specific energy (mse) and aggressiveness  mse is a parameter commonly used to measure cutting efficiency and can be defined as the work done per unit volume excavated, according to teale (1965)  the aggressiveness, in a single cutter scenario, can be defined as the slope of the cutting force to normal force (akbari et al , 2014a) and, conventionally, the more aggressive the cutter, the higher the penetration rate achieved  in numerical modeling of single cutter test, keeping constant the depth of cut and the rate of penetration among simulations, the aggressiveness can be used as a sensitivity parameter in analyses regarding the cutting efficiency | 
2015-389 	 experimental investigation of fracturing of shale with water |abstract  fracture-permeability relations of shale are needed in hydraulic fracturing, co2 sequestration, and nuclear waste disposal  in this study, we use triaxial coreflood experiments in combination with x-ray tomography to study fracture generation and permeability during injection of water  the experiments were conducted on utica shale at temperatures from 25-50 °c and confining pressures from 3 4 to 13 8 mpa  fractures were generated using direct shear methods with semi-circular anvils  permeability was monitored following fracture events as a function of continuing deformation and hydrostatic pressure  fractures propagating parallel to bedding were an order of magnitude more transmissive than fractures propagating perpendicular to layers  maximum whole rock permeability ranged from 70-900 md  shale strength when fractures propagated parallel to bedding was a linear function of the angle between the fracture and the direct-shear plane and was strength (mpa) = 0 8034 x angle (°) + 26 259  this behavior appeared to be related to the amount of shear-plane deformation accommodated by bedding planes  permeability was not a clear function of this angle but peaked sharply for fractures that crossed bedding planes at angle near 45°  significant deformation (>1%the flow of fluids through fractured shale is important in hydraulic fracturing, co2 sequestration, and nuclear waste disposal  in hydraulic fracturing, the goal is to produce hydrocarbon by generating (or reactivating) pervasive, permeable fracture systems  in co2 sequestration, risk assessment studies must consider the possibility that pressurization of the storage reservoir could induce fractures in caprock (which may be shale) where the consequences are governed by the permeability of the damage zone  in nuclear waste disposal located in shale formations, risk assessment studies must consider the permeability of potential flow paths generated during excavation of the repository, within pre-existing fracture networks, and within any subsequent fracture events induced by seismicity | 
2015-391 	 measure of friction during drilling of rocks |abstract  detournay and tan (2002) performed experiments with a rock cutting device to measure the load required to fail the rock under confining stress  they proposed models describing the correlation between the specific energy and confining stress for shear dilatant rocks as a function of unconfined specific energy at failure, cutter rake angle (<u+03b8>), internal friction angle (<u+03c6>) of the rock, and an assumed interface friction angle (<u+03c8>) between the rock and the cutter  the aim of this paper is to evaluate the model proposed by detournay and tan (2002)  their model assumes that the interfacial friction angle between the rock and the cutter is equal to the internal friction angle (<u+03c8>)  their model also assumes that the rate of change coefficient (m) is constant for different bore hole pressures (pm)  to evaluate the model, data on three (3) rock formations (mancos shale, pierre shale, and catoosa shale) was used in the study  the data on mancos shale and pierre shale was obtained from zijsling (1987) and data on catoosa shale was obtained from smith (1998)  quantitative assessment of rate of change coefficient (m) of specific energy was also accomplished to evaluate the assumption that m is constant for different bore hole pressures  the results show that the interface friction angle varies with the bore hole pressure and is not equal to the internal friction angle  the results also show that rate of change coefficient (m) of specific energy estimated using the equation proposed by detournay and tan (2002) and an assumed internal friction is not representative of m obtained from known values of internal friction angle, interface friction angle, and back rake angle   1  introduction  behavior of rock under a range of confining pressures has a vital role in its applications to many engineering and scientific disciplines  the strength and stress - strain behavior of rock under confining stress are particularly important to geophysicists analyzing plate tectonics, earthquakes, and other fault movements  they are also useful to engineers designing deep foundations for buildings, off shore structures, and dams on the rocks  it is significantly important for drilling engineers to understand the behavior of the rock under various confining stresses to understand the behavior of drill bits on different kinds of rocks and to develop techniques for enhanced rate of penetration (rop)  confining pressures affect the unconfined strength of the rock and the energy required to cut a rock during drilling | 
2015-393 	 computer modeling applied in the design of underground salt caverns opened by solution mining for gas storage |abstract  this paper discusses the design of underground salt caverns, opened by solution mining, for co2 sequestration in brazil, considering the large thicknesses and continuity of rock salt overlying the pre-salt reservoirs  rock salt has negligible porosity when compared to other geomaterials, which ensures sealing to most fluids and gases  it is also subject to the phenomenon of visco-plastic creep deformation and can tolerate high levels of strain without developing structural damage of its mineral skeleton  another phenomenon is the process of self-healing, where cracks and faults are self-healed with time  taking advantage of these properties, caverns developed by solution mining in salt domes may be used for storage of hydrocarbons and other products, for example co2  special attention is given to the geomechanical structural design of the caverns using computer codes developed for the simulation of excavations in salt rock formations, considering validated constitutive creep laws obtained by lab tests  the codes have being used in the design of several clusters of caverns for brine production, design of the underground conventional potash mine and in the design of the pre-salt oil wells, for the exploration and production of the pre-salt reservoirs  despite being a technology already dominated worldwide, the use of underground storage of co2 in salt caverns for offshore application in deep and ultra-deep water is unprecedented   1  introduction  with the application of new technologies for processing and interpreting seismic data, petrobras, in recent years, has achieved great success in the discovery of giant oil fields underlying thick layers of rock salt  the rock salt has negligible porosity when compared to other geomaterials, which ensures excellent sealing to most fluids and gases, even under high pressures  rock salt is also subject to the phenomenon of visco-plastic creep deformation which develops in the time domain as the relaxation of the deviatoric or shear stresses, to the condition of steady-state equilibrium with constant creep strain rate and can tolerate high levels of strain without developing structural damage of its mineral skeleton  this phenomenon can be observed in nature in the sedimentary layers intercepted by salt domes or other structures associated with the natural movement of salt | 
2015-394 	 induced microseismic monitoring in salt caverns |abstract  in recent years, salt cavern failures and sinkholes associated with brine wells in solution mining have created concerns and initiated more restrict regulations and guidelines for solution mining operations  one of the monitoring tools for cavern stability relates to tracking passive microseismic activity during brine well operation  any gradual or sudden rockmass failure is often associated with pre-failure microfracturing activity in the rockmass which leads to microseismic activity  a suitably designed microseismic system with sufficient sensitivity can capture the pre-failure activity days or months before the failure and along with other instrumentation and geotechnical analysis can provide critical information that can be used to help identify and possibly reduce the risk of catastrophic rockmass failure  this paper presents two cases of induced microseismic monitoring in soft rock media and of salt caverns created by solution mining  an example of a microseismic system installation and calibration in a salt cavern is demonstrated, and the results of advanced analysis from a second salt cavern monitoring are briefly investigated   1  introduction  microseismic systems were initially developed for applications in underground hard rock mining due to increased microseismic activity initiated by higher mining depths and therefore higher stress levels  the increased seismic activity and violent rockbursts causing damage and fatalities led to more rapid development of this technology  the main purpose of early microseismic systems was to enhance safety in seismic active areas of the mine  the early systems were only able to provide approximate information on location and magnitude of seismic events   today, however, the high-end technology is capable of recording full waveforms on a continuous basis that can further be processed through advanced seismology codes and powerful computers for additional understanding of the rockmass behavior  the systematic mechanism and source parameter analysis of seismic events can now be reliably used as a geotechnical tool to assess strain/stress changes in the monitored volume | 
2015-396 	 design and construction of a deep excavation in extremely poor rock mass |abstract  a bored 13 4 m diameter highway tunnel being constructed across the istanbul strait in istanbul, turkey under a maximum 12 bars of water pressure required a deep excavation on the asian side of the waterway for launching the tunnel boring machine and initiating natm tunnels on the opposite end of the excavation  the excavation is up to 38 2 m deep and 173 7 m long in very poor quality sedimentary rock consisting of siltstone/mudstone and sandstone  the selection of design rock parameters considered not only data from site explorations, but previous excavation experience in istanbul  during initial excavation stages, unexpectedly high lateral movements of the anchored support walls were measured  using the monitoring data, a back-analysis of the excavation support system was performed to determine revised design rock parameters  the support system was modified by adding additional levels of anchors, and the excavation was successfully completed december 2013   1  introduction  the eurasia tunnel project is part of a new 14 6-km road link between kazlicesme on the european side of the istanbul strait and goztepe on the asian side (figure 1)  the project helps address istanbul's increasing traffic problems and greatly reduces the travel time across the istanbul strait by avoiding the need to use either a ferry or one of the city’s perimeter bridges  the project includes a 3 4-km two-deck tunnel beneath the seabed at the southern end of the istanbul strait (also known as the bosphorus) constructed with a tunnel boring machine (tbm), 2 km of natm tunnels, and 1 km of cut-andcover tunnel structures  the project also provides roadway improvements for the approaches to the tunnel  the tunnel is designed for passenger vehicles and small trucks with a limited vertical clearance of 3 0 m  the east and west bound roadways are stacked within the 13 2-m outside diameter tunnel  the republic of turkey, ministry of transport, maritime affairs and communications formulated the project technical specifications  figure 2 presents a general plan and profile for the eurasia tunnel project  the various underground elements of the project are described by clark et al  (2015) | 
2015-397 	 numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing using a three-dimensional fracture model coupled with an adaptive mesh fluid model |abstract  a three-dimensional fracture model developed in the context of the combined finite-discrete element method is incorporated into a two-way fluid-solid coupling model  the fracture model is capable of simulating the whole fracturing process  it includes pre-peak hardening deformation, post-peak strain softening, transition from continuum to discontinuum, and the explicit interaction between discrete fracture surfaces, for both tensile and shear fracture initiation and propagation  the fluid-solid coupling model can simulate the interactions between moving fluids and multi-body solids  by incorporating the fracture model into the coupling model, a methodology of using the new coupling model to capture fracturing behaviour of solids in fluid-solid coupling simulations is proposed  to solve the problem in the coupling model of having adaptive continuous meshes being used by the fluid code and discontinuous meshes in the solid code, a scheme to convert different meshes is developed  a single fracture propagation driven by fluid pressures is simulated and the results show that the modelling obtains the correct critical load and propagation direction for fluid-driven fracturing  several important phenomena, such as stress concentration ahead of the fracture tip, adaptive refinement of fluid mesh as a response to the fracture propagation and fluids flowing into fractures, are properly captured   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing has been used in the oil and gas industry for more than half a century  it is particularly important for the extraction from unconventional reservoirs, which otherwise would be considered as uneconomical  in the research field of hydraulic fracturing, an increasing amount of effort has been put into the development of novel numerical models to simulate realistic scenarios  however, the numerical modelling of hydraulic fractures still remains a challenge for computational mechanics because of the complexities in fluid-solid coupling, fracture characterisation, and particularly in three dimensions, the complicated geometry and topology update when fractures propagate  in recently years, many attempts have been made and significant progress achieved in three-dimensional hydraulic fracturing simulations  carter et al  (2000) [1] proposed a fully threedimensional hydraulic fracture model, but they neglected the fluid continuity equation in the area around the fracture  secchi and schrefler (2012) [2] developed a method to simulate three-dimensional hydraulic fractures in porous media and presented an example of a concrete dam  in this paper, a three-dimensional fracture model is incorporated into a two-way fluid-solid coupling model for hydraulic fracture simulations  the three-dimensional fracture model is capable of simulating the whole fracturing process  it includes prepeak hardening deformation, post-peak strain softening, transition from continuum to discontinuum, and the explicit interaction between discrete fracture surfaces, for both tensile and shear fracture initiation and propagation  after incorporating it into the fluid-solid coupling model, where the interaction between fluids and solids can be explicitly simulated, the initiation and propagation of fractures can be driven by forces generated both from solids loading and transferred from fluids loading, e g  fluid pressure, which significantly extends the application of this fracture model into some very important areas that would not be possible with only solids modelling, e g  the simulation of hydraulic fractures | 
2015-398 	 simulation of particle suspensions using a coupled lattice boltzmann and discrete element method |abstract  using a coupled lattice boltzmann and discrete element method, we have developed a new tool for the numerical characterisation of dense suspension rheology  this approach has been implemented using a shared memory, multicore, parallel architecture which allows for rapid and inexpensive evaluation of model results  where model capabilities include non-newtonian rheology, turbulence, fluid-solid interactions, and lubricated solid-solid interactions  through consideration of the fundamental phenomena of flow and contact mechanics this model is able to accurately capture the suspension rheology   using this coupled framework we have implemented a numerical couette flow rheometer, discrete element particles are packed into a cubic lattice boltzmann domain which is periodic in the lateral directions  using either stress or shear rate control, this model then simulates the shearing of the particulate suspension  the resultant hydrodynamic and mechanical forces on the shearing plane are recovered once the model has achieved a steady state, where these results are used to compute an effective suspension viscosity  the results from this analysis have been validated against existing semi-empirical expressions    1  introduction  simulation of particle transport often occurs at a scale orders of magnitude larger than the size of the particulate inclusions  where previous work in this field has focused on development of constitutive equations to describe the effective viscosity of suspensions with a specific solid volume fraction [1]  the rheology specified by such expressions is then typically used to calibrate a power-law based rheological model [2]  however, work by lyon & leal has shown that even in a relatively simple poiseuille flow the distribution of solid particulates is not uniform across the aperture [3]  this spatially varying solid volume fraction shows the need to directly simulate both the fluid and particles in order for correct flow behaviour to be accurately represented | 
2015-399 	 numerical study of the impact of co2-fluid-rock interactions on porosity and permeability evolution in fractured carbonate rocks |abstract  in this study we used co2 core-flood experimental data to develop and calibrate a three-dimensional continuum-scale reactive transport model for simulating co2-induced rock porosity and permeability evolution  during the core flooding experiments the co2-equilibrated brine was injected into carbonate rock samples, which were collected from the arbuckle carbonate reservoir, wellington, kansas  we analyzed x-ray computed microtomography (xcmt) characterization data to examine heterogeneous distributions of pore structures, naturally occurring fractures, and mineral phases inside the cores, and then used them to constrain initial model macroscopic properties including porosity, permeability, and mineral compositions  model chemical reaction kinetics, porosity-permeability, and porosity-surface area correlations were also calibrated with the experimental data  our model results indicate that the calibrated continuum-scale reactive transport models are able to adequately predict the dissolution behavior of fractured carbonate rocks at a core scale  in addition the model calibration against core flood experiments provides a useful basis for upscaling reactive transport properties used to describe carbonate dissolution from the laboratory (core) scale to field (reservoir) scale   1  introduction  understanding the effect of rock-water interactions on rock porosity and permeability under co2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery (eor) conditions is an active area of research [e g  1-9]  to this purpose, there is a need to develop reliable reactive transport models, which can accurately represent essential features of co2-fluid-rock interactions at laboratory and field scales  this is challenging, because adaptation of pore scale models needed to describe fluid-mineral geochemical interactions is limited in scale by their high computational cost  for this reason a macro-scale continuum model based on darcy flow approximations is often used to simulate reactive transport processes, and evaluate geochemical and transport impacts of rock-fluid interactions at large scales  an important challenge in modeling reactive transport and mineral chemical alteration processes, particularly in a heterogeneous and fractured rock system, is to constrain effective macroscopic parameters (e g  porosity-permeability relationships, chemical rate kinetics, porosity-reactive-surface-area correlations) required by the continuum-scale models  model predictions made in the absence of proper calibration or upscaling of these governing transport and reaction parameters are highly uncertain  a number of studies [e g  6-12] have suggested that the use of either pore-scale simulations or experimental data to calibrate the continuum-scale models could help reduce such uncertainty | 
2015-402 	 numerical creep analysis of chalk cavities accounting for joints degradation |abstract  unexploited underground cavities may represent a potential hazard for the surrounding environment when the occurring consequential instabilities augment and propagate upwards toward the surface causing serious damage  nowadays, north france and its region face a similar risk where large constructed areas, and due to urban expansion, have been extended to surfaces underlain by shallow cavities  therefore, it is necessary to anticipate and control the circumstances   this work aims to provide an understanding of the deformational behavior of underground cavities on long term process by carrying out a numerical creep analysis of the failure mechanisms  this is performed based using a coupled constitutive law developed to account for the long term degradation phenomenon of the chalk continuum in the presence of joints  numerical analysis of the time dependant behavior of the underground cavity considering different joint orientations is performed  in addition to visual inspections which remain the most important for the cavity risk assessment, this approach provides comprehensive elements for a better understanding of the progressive failure and thus the temporal aspect of the deformational behavior and failure of underground cavities    1  introduction  natural and anthropogenic underground cavities may represent a potential hazard for the surrounding environment due to consequential instabilities that might end up with serious damage  particularly, when these cavities are at shallow depths, the risk that the damage reaches the ground surface is increased due to the upward propagation of localized rupture that might happen  north france and its region are nowadays threatened by such a risk where large built-up areas have been developed in zones underlain by unexploited shallow cavities excavated several decades ago in the existing chalk layers  hence, this contribution aims to analyze by numerical means, the behavior of these underground cavities and the corresponding failure mechanisms, taking into consideration the effect of time  this latter is represented by the presence of induced fractures which might appear in short term or in long term, and degradation of the chalk which is a time dependent behavior | 
2015-405 	 correlations between acoustic emission microcrack displacement vectors and in situ stress conditions during laboratory hydraulic fracture testing |abstract  laboratory hydraulic fracturing experiments were performed on a single true triaxially confined granite specimen with samples sizes of 15<u+00d7>15<u+00d7>25 cm3and monitored with acoustic emission (ae) to simulate the field development of oil, gas, and enhanced geothermal systems reservoirs  pump pressure, wellhead pressure, pump flow, applied triaxial stresses, and ae were monitored throughout testing  ae was monitored and extensively analyzed post-testing for source location, ae event attributes, and source mechanism characterization  mode of failure of each individual microcrack was determined using ae moment tensor inversion techniques  orientation and direction of crack displacement vector and crack face normal vectors were calculated from an eigenvector decomposition of the moment tensor solution and provided valuable information regarding how individual microcracks contribute to an image of the overall coalesced hydraulic fracture  further analysis was performed to determine if trends existed between boundary stress conditions and the crack vector information  several events were observed to have similar microcrack displacement vector orientations compared to principal stress directions  comparisons between crack displacement vector orientations and mode of failure were also examined  the usefulness of the ae microcrack displacement vector information is apparent when understanding rock damage and possible alterations of the flow behavior near hydraulic fractures    1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing has become a standard practice in oil- and gas-bearing formations because of the high commonality of nanodarcy permeability source rock in several of these reservoirs  a dense hydraulic fracture and wellbore connected natural fracture network is desired to reach as many isolated hydrocarbon-rich pores and natural fractures as possible  although dense fracture networks are desired, even if they are obtained, much of the rock between and near the fracture faces contribute very little to production because of the extremely low permeability  it is desirable to understand the microcracking process very near these fracture faces and throughout the macro-scale hydraulic fracture network to determine the affected changes to the reservoir rock, which can alter the near fracture rock permeability  | 
2015-406 	 field and experimental brittleness (toughness) determination of vaca muerta shale |abstract  rock fracability characterization is a key issue for unconventional reservoirs stimulation  this property not only controls hydraulic fracture initiating and propagating pressure, but also affects the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) which determines well productivity  several parameters such as brittleness, plasticity and toughness among others are frequently referred in the literature to describe rock fracability  this paper discusses the validity of some of these parameters and emphasizes the fracture mechanics approach to characterize rock fracability based on the critical stress intensity factor (kic)   an experimental study was conducted using synthetic and real vaca muerta (vm) shale samples  kic was determined using two types of specimens, the notched brazilian disc and the semicircular three point load tests  the influence of applied load rate, material composition and medium was analyzed  the implications of these parameters in the hydraulic fracture process are discussed  the experimental results were compared with kic values calculated using information obtained from vaca muerta fracture jobs    1  introduction  effective hydraulic fracturing is a key issue for successful shale play development and exploitation  this challenge demands characterization of appropriate rock mechanical properties  the concept of rock “fracability”, referred as a material property that determines the capability for fracturing the rock during a stimulation operation, has become one of the main drivers to select sweet spots in a given unconventional formation  this property not only controls hydraulic fracture initiating and propagating pressure, but also affects the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) which determines well productivity [1]  several parameters such as brittleness, plasticity and toughness, among others, are frequently referred in the literature to describe rock fracability  the different brittle indexes (b*) proposed by several authors, which are calculated using other rock mechanical properties as the young<u+00b4>s modulus (e), poisson<u+00b4>s ratio (<u+03bd>) among others, are good examples of this  | 
2015-408 	 fracture dimension investigation of laboratory hydraulic fracture interaction with natural discontinuity using acoustic emission |abstract  hydraulic fracturing is performed in unconventional oil and gas and enhanced geothermal systems (egs) reservoirs to enhance formation permeability and create a conductive pathway for fluid flow to one or multiple wellbores  typically, energy production requires the existence of a densely naturally fractured medium or a complex hydraulic fracture network or, in some cases, both  when targeting a naturally fractured reservoir, stimulation is meant to provide a connection between these natural fractures to generate large regions of hydraulically connected rock for production  although hydraulic fracturing is performed often in naturally faulted or fractured media, the geometry and effectiveness of the hydraulic fracture crossing natural discontinuities is not well-understood  to better understand hydraulic fracture interactions with discontinuities, laboratory scale hydraulic fracturing tests were performed which contained an idealized case of one large angled discontinuity, or natural fracture  two-block sample sizes of 15<u+00d7>15<u+00d7>25 cm3were subjected to true triaxial confinement before wellbore placement and completion  acoustic emissions (ae) were monitored during the fracture initiation, propagation, and fracture interaction process  an in depth post-test analysis was performed on ae microcrack data to characterize the hydraulic fracture and determine its effectiveness crossing the discontinuity  individual microcrack mode of failure was determined as well as relative volumetric deformation using moment tension inversion techniques  both sides of the natural fracture were compared in terms of source mechanism information of microcracks to determine if changes in failure characteristics occurred  post-test visualization of the hydraulic fractures at the surface provided an image of severe fracture dimension reduction, particularly fracture width and crossing the natural fracture  ae characterization was compared with visual inspections to determine if ae source parameters correlated with observed post-fracture imaging data  implications of drastic hydraulic fracture width reductions crossing natural fractures include under predictions of stimulated reservoir volume from field scale ae data, and reduced production | 
2015-409 	 static versus dynamic moduli: another piece in the puzzle |abstract  static and dynamic moduli differ a lot, also in rocks with no dispersion  in particular, the static:dynamic stiffness ratio is very sensitive to the stress path  the ability to model this behavior is important for several applications, for instance in situations where static moduli are needed while only dynamic moduli are accessible by measurements  this paper discusses the impact of friction controlled sliding along grain contacts and crack surfaces  a classical grain pack model which incorporates this effect is found to describe several of the main characteristic features of the static:dynamic relations, suggesting that friction controlled sliding is a dominating effect  some discrepancies between model and observations can probably be related to the regular structure of the grain pack model versus the irregular microstructure of a real rock   1  introduction  the term "static moduli" is commonly referring to the set of stiffness parameters defined as a ratio between an applied stress increment and the resulting strain increment, while "dynamic moduli" is referring to the set of stiffness parameters that can be derived from density times an elastic wave velocity squared  corresponding static and dynamic moduli are equal for a linearly elastic material  for heterogeneous materials like porous rocks, static and dynamic moduli may differ significantly [1,2]  there are several potential causes for this:  a) strain rate  deformation of a rock may involve several processes that require some time to complete  the rock's resistance against deformation may therefore depend on the strain rate  the relevant strain rate for a dynamic modulus is primarily given by the frequency of the elastic wave  the strain rate associated with a static modulus depends on the loading conditions  for a standard laboratory test, the "static" strain rate corresponds to an elastic wave with frequency in the lower seismic range [3] |

2015-411 	 observation and modeling of fluid flow under matrix and fracturing injections in unconsolidated sand |abstract  recently conducted small (laboratory) scale experiments with fluid injection in unconsolidated sand packs revealed various patterns of fluid flow  some of these patterns depart from that commonly discussed in literature  the experiments have been conducted in a pressure chamber under true-triaxial confining stresses with two types of sand packs: (a) homogeneous and isotropic; and (b) a layered, transverse-isotropic sand pack with fluid injection into a thin sand layer between two weakly permeable or impermeable confining layers  tests were designed to investigate how fluid injections below and above the minimum confining stress affect the flow behavior in the sand pack and injectivity  under matrix injection conditions (i e , injection pressure below minimum confining stress), the initial sand pack structure is practically undisturbed  under fracture injection conditions (i e , injection pressure above the minimum confining stress) using a clear low viscosity fluid a heterogeneous and/or anisotropic fluid flow pattern is observed in both types of sand pack  heterogeneous fluid flow in such cases is associated with the formation of large scale perturbations of the initially homogeneous sand packing in the regions adjacent to the wellbore  under fracture injection conditions using a solids-laden fluid, a very different fluid flow pattern results  specifically, highly localized fluid flow pattern through narrow crack-like openings is created in the sand pack, where the ‘cracks’ have a clear filter cake on their surface  this paper briefly reports various test conditions and their corresponding fluid flow patterns, discusses the underlying physics, and outlines a mathematical model of the observed fluid flow through unconsolidated sand under matrix and fracturing conditions   1  introduction  water injection is widely used for enhancing the transport of hydrocarbons in waterflooding operations, for restoring depleted reservoir pressure, as well as disposing of waste water  a high rate injection is usually required to achieve the objectives of waterflooding  loss of injectivity can be a significant problem in some unconsolidated sand formations  understanding the root cause(s) and the development of a predictive model of such phenomena are required for solution of the problem | 
2015-418 	 underground mine roof crack formation simulation with creep of rock mass |abstract  as a leading cause of injuries in underground coal mines, roof fall has been widely investigated with different methods  the majority of the research was conducted without considering the time factor  in fact, field observation show that the roof fall involves a time-dependent failure process  to investigate roof failure, udec was used to simulate the time-dependent fracturing process associated with creep of rock mass  the rock mass around an opening was meshed into small voronoi blocks, and parameters for the joints between these blocks were calibrated to make uniaxial compressive strength of a 4m<u+00d7>8m rock block approximately equal to that of rock mass  the cracks caused by stress redistribution under different conditions can be captured by this method  after equilibrium, creep simulation was run to a predetermined time  limited cracks forming within roof and intensive cracks forming within coal pillars are observed under different conditions, including high stress ratio, laminations, and smaller excavation width  when the yield condition and crack formation are combined, better simulation results can be obtained   1  introduction  according to msha (2014), improvements in roof control technology have significant decreased fatality, but roof fall accidents are still a leading cause of injuries in underground coal mines  this safety problem has been investigated for decades  overbey et al  [1] considered surface fracture trace density, changes in roof rock type, and topographic unloading due to drainage the three major factors affecting the occurrence of roof fall, and proposed a technique to predict probable roof fall areas ahead of mining operations  aggson [2] theoretically summarized the roof failure mechanisms under different conditions  su and peng [3] examined the intrinsic mechanisms of cutter roof failure by combining field investigation, laboratory testing, underground instrumentation, and numerical modeling, and found that high vertical stress coupled with a stiffer coal is the dominant factor in the formation of cutter roof  gadde and peng [4] proposed one approach using a strain-softening model to simulate the cutter initiation and propagation process  then this method was used by ray [5] to study the influence of cutting sequence on cutters and roof fall in underground mines  gao and stead [6] simulated the formation of cutter roof failure with 3dec and pfc3dwith respect to the orientation of major horizontal stress and the forward of excavation  coggan et al  [7] used continuum, discontinuum, and hybrid finite element-discrete element codes to model the deformation of coal measure strata, and the modelled results demonstrated that the thickness of the relatively weak mudstone in the roof of the tunnel has a significant influence on the extent of failure  | 
2015-419 	 understanding the correlation between induced seismicity and wastewater injection in the fort worth basin |abstract  a basin-wide simulation of wastewater injection is performed for the fort worth basin  uncertainties in geology and limited availability of injection data were two of the main challenges that were encountered during the course of the research  simulation results show some spatial and temporal correlation between the pore pressure change and earthquakes occurrence  there are also areas of substantial predicted pore pressure increase where no seismicity is detected  the results suggest that proper assessment of seismic risk requires good subsurface geology (flow characteristics and pre-existing fault geometry) as well as well injection rate and pressure data  p>  1  background and motivation  one of the very first studies on induced seismicity due to fluid injection was performed on the denver earthquakes which occurred in the 1960’s due to injection into a disposal well at the rocky mountain arsenal (rma) [1]  injection into the well at the rma occurred between from 1962 to 1966 with a variable injection rate at different times during the injection periods [1, 2]  it was observed that seismic events continued to occur even after fluid injection was stopped [1, 2]  a few years following the event, an experiment conducted in rangely, colorado concluded that fluid injection can be used to control seismic events [3]   since the 1960s, the link between earthquake clusters and disposal wells has been extensively examined [4]  research has been done to correlate the various parameters, such as injection pressure and reservoir transmissivity, to the occurrence of induced earthquakes [1-4]  yet, even though the mechanics behind induced earthquake is established, risk assessment and prediction is still difficult [1-4]  | 
2015-420 	 an investigation of rough surface closure with application to fracturing |abstract  closure of rough surfaces under normal closure stress is investigated in this study  rough surface closure model presented in this paper is based on surface asperity deformation  the main components of deformation are asperity compression and half-space deformation  mechanical interaction among asperities which is a consequence of half-space deformation is considered in the model and its impact on the closure behavior is analyzed  asperities are assumed to be elastic-perfectly-plastic materials and therefore may experience inelastic deformation under closure stress  modeling results indicate that a significant portion of closure takes place earlier on at low stress levels because there are fewer asperities in contact initially  asperity inelastic deformation is found to influence rough surface closure with its degree of impact depending on surface profile  a mechanical interaction sensitivity analysis indicates that neglecting interaction among asperities may lead to erroneous results particularly in surfaces with closely spaced asperities  by conducting an analysis on the elastic properties of asperity and half-space we found that the normal stiffness is much more influenced by young’s modulus of half-space rather than that of asperity  |1  introduction  acid fracturing is a stimulation technique which is being used in carbonate reservoirs  this technique is considered as an alternative to the well-known propped hydraulic fracturing  fractures tend to close due to the in-situ stresses acting normal to the plane of fracture  fracture closure has detrimental effect on the conductivity and therefore, should be prevented  proppant is widely used in the hydraulic fracturing process and this material serves to keep the fracture open against closure stress  however, the mechanism by which the fracture is being held open is essentially different in acid fracturing technique   acid fracturing is a complex process in which acid reacts with rock and removes some parts of it, resulting in two random rough surfaces  asperities on these surfaces act as pillars to keep the fracture open  fracture surfaces come into contact after the pump pressure is dissipated  the success of an acid fracturing job depends on how well the asperities withstand the closure stress  increasing effective stress often reduces the fracture aperture and its conductivity | 
2015-421 	 fdem modelling of thermo-mechanical wellbore instabilities within shale formations |abstract  this work demonstrates the potential of using the hybrid finite-discrete element method (fdem) to model thermal and mechanical coupling mechanisms around a wellbore in shale formations  the simulated thermal and mechanical stresses were first validated in separate models by comparing them to closed-form solutions  then, the stability of a borehole in opalinus clay (mont terri, switzerland) was analyzed  the prominent mechanism affecting the wellbore stability was found to be the mud pressure applied to the excavation boundary  at lower in-situ stresses, the extent of fracturing due to tensile stresses from cooling the rock by -100 °c was greater than at higher stress regimes  this was due to the greater stress differential between the mud pressure and the stress field in the higher stress regime  the higher mud pressure counteracts the thermal stresses and thus less fractures develop  it was also observed that the choice of constitutive model (i e , isotropic versus anisotropic) had little effect on the temperature change required for fracture initiation, but it did influence the fracture pattern due to preferential planes of weakness present in the bedded opalinus clay    1  introduction  wellbore instability has long been an issue in the oil and gas industry which has resulted in estimated monetary losses of 8 billion us$ per year worldwide [1]  instability issues have more often been observed when drilling through shale formations  as the hole is being excavated, drilling fluids have an integral role in stabilizing the hole since they cool the drill bit, remove drill cuttings, prevent formation fluids from entering the well and stabilize the borehole walls [2]    inherently, the drilling fluids interact with the rock formation through thermal exchanges and chemical interactions  it is typical to encounter reservoir temperatures which are greater than the temperature of the drilling fluids [3]  as a result of cooling the formation, the rock tends to contract and a reduction of hoop stress is generated, effectively lowering the fracture gradient [4]; thus increasing the likelihood of developing tensile fractures at the hole wall  this mechanism may cause fractures to nucleate which in turn may result in wellbore instability | 
2015-422 	 using image windows for the analysis of fracture traces and fractures |abstract  rock fractures are of considerable engineering significance in fields such as hard rock tunneling and fractured rock hydrology  fracture traces – the 2d manifestations of fractures at exposed rock surfaces – can provide valuable information about the rock mass  of particular interest is estimating the distribution, or the mean and variance, of fracture size based on inevitably censored and biased field observations  this paper describes a novel and powerful tool – termed an image window – that can aid in the quantitative interpretation of fracture trace data  image windows are used for the construction of subfields corresponding to regions of the rock mass that define the loci of fractures for certain types of intersection between fractures and the sampling window  counts of the various types of fracture intersection on exposures can then be used to help infer the size characteristics of fractures in the rock mass in a meaningful way  the method can be applied in one or two dimensions towards estimating size characteristics of fractures traces, or, in three dimensions, to infer the size characteristics of fractures embedded in a 3-d rock mass and exposed at a 2-d sampling surface  we show how to construct image windows in one or two dimensions, and we introduce the construction of image windows in three dimensions    1  introduction  rock fractures are significant in several engineering fields, including hard rock tunneling and fractured rock hydrology; and fracture traces – the 2d manifestations of fractures at exposed rock surfaces - can provide useful information about the fractures in the rock mass  during site investigation or, e g , tunnel excavation, the limited exposures of traces are used for estimation of the mean and variance of trace length, and other statistical information about the fracture and fracture trace populations  such inferences must take into account unavoidable biases and censoring of the data obtained from the rock exposure [1–7]   this paper describes a novel and powerful approach to the interpretation of fracture trace data, using what the author terms image windows  the method automatically corrects for sampling biases and the effects of censoring  in addition to deriving information about the underlying population of fracture traces, we show how the technique can be used to derive information about the distributional parameters of fracture size in the 3d rock mass, not just the trace length  | 
2015-423 	 effect of coal-rock interface properties on failure stability of coal pillars expressed in energy terms |abstract  rockbursts, or coal bumps in coal mines, involve the spontaneous, violent fracture of rock  this paper discusses the application of energy concepts to back-analysis studies of coal bump events  two-dimensional distinct element models were constructed of coal pillars with a range of material properties assigned to both coal material and rock-coal interfaces  these models were used to explore the compounding effects of the brittle failures of coal material and coal-rock interfaces on the energy release magnitudes  loading conditions applied to these models represent a pillar failing individually as well as a full panel collapse  results from the pillar models are presented in terms of the kinetic energy released from the unstable failures  due to variation of coal and coal-rock interface properties, the magnitude of the excess kinetic energy was found to vary significantly  the total magnitude of kinetic energy released from the models was found to be significantly higher when brittle failure behavior was assigned to both the coal and to the coal-rock interface  this increase in excess energy indicated larger unstable failures and higher dynamic efficiencies under such material combination  in addition to the methodology for analyzing the effect of coal material and interface properties on the pillar failure stability, the paper also introduces and demonstrates a feasible failure mode for large widthheight ratio pillars   1  introduction  compressive and shear slip failures emerge in deep underground mines under the influence of mining activities  historically, several research efforts were made to address the role of excess energy on the initiation and occurrence of rockbursts, which included the energy release rate (err) concept proposed by cook [1] and excess shear stress (ess) presented by ryder [2]  however, neither of these approaches accounts for brittle failure of rock and they have therefore not been ordinarily applied to study rockburst or coal bump incidents  in this paper, the commercially available software universal distinct element code (udec) is used to numerically model the failure instabilities and to present an illustration based on the unstable excess energy concept   udec maintains the ability to simulate the quasi-brittle behavior of discontinuities through the continuousyielding (cy) joint property [3, 4]  the mohr-coulomb strain-softening (mcss) constitutive model may then be used to represent quasi-brittle material failure during unstable loading conditions [5]  the program also calculates the kinetic energy released and ultimately damped out during the simulation  a series of single pillar models were built with these combinations of tools to better understand the mechanism of bumps within wide coal pillars | 
2015-425 	 coupled euler-lagrange simulation of the response of a tunnel in jointed rock to explosive loading |abstract  we simulated the defense threat reduction agency (dtra)-sponsored jointed limestone test (jolt) using the abaqus fully coupled euler-lagrange computation scheme  jolt was a small-scale experiment consisting of over 37,000 individual cubes of limestone surrounding simulated tunnels  this test bed was loaded with ground shock generated by a spherical compb charge, thereby providing data for the study of computer codes used to compute the response of buried tunnels to explosive loading  we modeled the cubes as continuum blocks with contact, making for a dis-continuum simulation using a hybrid continuum code including eulerian modeling of the explosive region and lagrangian modeling of the remainder of the test bed  this paper has been approved for unlimited release under la-ur-15-21382   1  introduction  the defense threat reduction agency (dtra) has funded studies of tunnel vulnerability to blast effects for decades  the studies have included experiments of various complexity and scale as well as numerical analysis  several projects have combined computational studies with experiments to validate predictive algorithms  numerical approaches have evolved based not only on prior knowledge but also due to advances in computing hardware and software capabilities  the focus of this paper is on a recent three-dimensional (3-d) simulation effort, but we will also provide some background material by describing an older twodimensional (2-d) computational effort that laid some of the groundwork for this later work  2  mighty north  the mighty north event was a laboratory-scale high explosive test performed in the mid-90s to investigate various approaches to numerical simulation of the response of tunnels to explosive-induced ground shock [1, 2]  the test bed (figure 1) consisted of 1 2-m long, 5-cm square cross-section bars of limestone stacked in an imbricate pattern to simulate a layered, jointed geologic setting  the “block of bricks” was 2 m square in section and 2 m long  the center of the block included a 0 4-m diameter aluminum-lined “tunnel ”| 
2015-426 	 3d modeling of sand production in waterflooding by coupled flow/ geomechanical numerical solutions |abstract  sand grains can be dislodged and mobilized when exposed to high fluid flow drag forces in oil recovery from poorly consolidated sandstone reservoirs  sand production usually enhances the wellbore inflow performances; however the drawbacks such as erosion and clogging of production lines and premature water breakthrough in waterflooding outweigh the benefits  in this study, an existing coupled 3-d multiphase flow/geomechanical code is further developed and implemented to model the propagation of dilated zone resulting from sand production  the dilated zone grows when the forces from fluid flow exceed the confining effective forces  the constituent materials’ mechanical behavior is described by a nonlinear hyperbolic model in which the stress variation over the mohr-coulomb shear failure surface is honored by a force rebalancing scheme  the study results indicate that the dilated zone geometry is a strict function of the weak layer thickness  the small load bearing capacity of the failed region leads to formation of a low stressed strip at the cavity/sand interface which aids the sand production by pressure gradient  the results of the current study can help understanding the significance of different mechanisms contributing to sand production in order to mitigate the premature water breakthrough problem in oilfield waterflooding practices   1  introduction  drag forces concomitant with fluid flow through loosely consolidated porous media might be strong enough to dislodge and mobilized the distorted sand grains towards the producer  the sand production phenomenon usually leads to a significant enhancement in well productivity [1]  nonetheless, uncontrolled sand production may result in operational problems such as costly workovers in flow production eroded equipment and the environmental issues associated with disposal of produced sand [2, 3]  sand production usually deteriorates the sweep efficiency causing premature water breakthrough in field waterflooding operations  the problem costs the oil and gas industry hundreds of millions dollars annually [4]   various causes of sand removal from loose formations into production wells have been quoted by different authors [5, 6]  vaziri et  al  [6] have divided sand production into early pressure induced and later production or water-cut induced stages  the former stage is triggered mainly by mutual acts of high drag forces and mechanically weak formation  however the latter is regarded to reduction in inter-granular capillary tension due to increase in water-cut  dissolved gas liberation in multi-phase flow (i e , foamy oil in heavy oil reservoir) is also a significant contributing factor in sand production [1, 4]  morita and boyd [7] have mentioned some sand production problems observed in the field due to reservoir pressure depletion in relatively strong formations, abnormally high tectonic force in relatively strong formations and sudden changes in flow rate | 
2015-430 	 a calibrated synthetic rock mass (srm) model for simulating crack growth in granitic rock considering grain scale heterogeneity of polycrystalline rock |abstract  this paper represents a grain-based discrete element model for simulating the quasi-brittle failure of polycrystalline rocks considering the grain-scale geometrical and material heterogeneities of geo-material fabric  a rock material is represented by an assembly of polygonal grains bonded through their cohesive contacts  as a result, the micro-fracturing process can be simulated explicitly by development of crack along grain boundaries  micro-mechanical parameters of the model is calibrated to lac du bonnet granite such that the model reproduces the physics similar to those of the rock during compression and tension  the calibration procedure is based on categorizing a set of input parameters that controls the elastic and fracture behavior of the model  the relation between macro-properties such as strength, friction and cohesion of the model and input micro-mechanical properties assigned to grains and interfaces is investigated by simulating a series of compressive triaxial and brazilain tensile tests  the numerical experimentations demonstrate the capability of discrete element-voronoi model to mimic the pre- and post-failure responses of brittle materials  the calibrated model very accurately predicts, in a quantitative sense, the macroscopic properties of real granite such as elastic properties, damage thresholds (crack initiation and interaction stresses), peak strengths (tensile and compression strengths), triaxial strength envelope (friction angle and cohesion)  results demonstrate the importance of considering the microstructural heterogeneity of rock fabric for successful modelling of brittle rock fracture   1  introduction  the process of brittle rock fracture during compression and tension is a result of the initiation, growth, and coalescence of multiple individual micro-cracks which eventually leads to formation of some clustered regions of macro-fractures in rock  as the compressive, or tensile stress applies across the boundaries of a rock sample, a complex heterogeneous stress system will be distributed through the rock in which the tensile and shear stresses will be concentrated at pre-existing flaws (i e  micro-cracks, grain boundaries, cavities, cleavages) [1]  if the localized tensile stress exceeds the local strength of the microstructure some micro-cracks start to form at the point on the boundary of pre-existing flaw where tensile stress concentration is greatest  these axially aligned extensional micro-cracks occur during the early loading stages of compression tests  as the applied deviatoric stresses increase in the specimen, the density of compression-induced tensile cracks increases, and eventual interaction and coalescence of these cracks result in formation of some localized and macroscopic damaged zones in the material  it is the presence and creation of such micro-fractures that cause the compressional stress-strain curve of rock to deviate from true elastic (linearity) in the pre-failure region [2] | 
2015-431 	 effects of adsorptive characteristics of shale on wellbore stability |abstract  interactions between aqueous drilling fluids and clay minerals have been identified as an important factor in wellbore instability of shale formations  current wellbore stability models consider the interactions between aqueous drilling fluids and pore fluid but their interactions with shale matrix is neglected  this study provides a realistic method to incorporate the interaction mechanism into wellbore stability analysis through laboratory experiment and mathematical modeling  the adsorption isotherms of two shale rocks, catoosa shale and mancos shale are obtained  the adsorption isotherms of the selected shales are compared with those of other shale types in the literature  it is shown that the adsorption isotherms of various shale rocks can be scaled using their respective cation exchange capacity, into a single adsorption curve  the experimental results show that the moisture content of shale is correlated with water activity using a multilayer adsorption theory  the adsorption parameters can be suggested as an index to characterize different shale formations  this study shows that the adsorption theory can be used to generalize wellbore stability problem in order to consider the case of non-ideal drilling fluids  furthermore, the adsorption model can be combined with empirical correlations to update the compressive strength of shale under downhole conditions  accordingly, a chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability simulator is developed to explore the stability of transversely isotropic shale formations  the coupled transport equations are solved using an implicit finite difference method  the results of this study indicate that the range of safe mud weight reduces due to the moisture adsorption phenomenon    1  introduction  shale rocks are often regarded as weak rocks in terms of compressive and tensile strength  it is known that presence of bedding planes and lamination imparts anisotropy to mechanical properties of rocks  the effect of bedding plane on rock failure has long been recognized [1-3]  drilling through shale formations is often associated with borehole instability problems  york et al  (2009) reported that the wellbore instability issues in a well with 20,000 ft md could at least cost 2 5 million dollars [4]  hamayun (2011) discussed the results of a survey that indicates about one third of non-productive time (npt) of drilling operations is spent on wellbore problems, of which a major portion is attributed to the wellbore instability issues [5]  hydration of clay minerals is recognized to be one of the important interaction processes between shale and drilling fluid during drilling process, which often leads to various operational problems such as shale swelling, stuck pipe, reduction of rate of penetration [6, 7]  usually two kinds of clay swelling is realized, namely, the interacrystalline swelling due to the hydration of exchangeable cations and osmotic swelling which occurs due to a large difference between ion concentration (or water activity) of shale and aqueous fluids [8-10]  | 
2015-433 	 new high-speed experiment capability for study of friction |abstract  recent experimental investigations of friction in rock demonstrate pronounced reduction in the apparent coefficient of friction at seismic slip rates (>0 1 m/s)  here we present the capabilities of a novel apparatus under development that can accommodate both double-direct and triaxial shear configurations to investigate friction at low to high-speed (up to 2 m/s) sliding conditions  the high acceleration capability of the loading-system is complementary to other high-speed testing machines, and is particularly well suited for study of rate-dependence of friction at high normal stress and of transient behavior associated with dynamic weakening  preliminary friction experiments at normal stress of approximately 5 mpa have been conducted to investigate transient friction associated with slip velocity steps from low to high speed sliding (>0 5 m/s)  results show that, independent of surface roughness, friction increases concurrently with a step increase to high velocity and then decreases with slip consistent with the direct and evolution effects documented for rate-state friction behavior at quasi-static slip rates  friction during sustained highspeed sliding is characterized by a steady and substantial weakening that likely reflects the accumulation of fine wear product along the surfaces    1  introduction  experiments designed to investigate the frictional behavior of rock generally involve sliding the surfaces of two blocks of rock past each other  in these tests the rock blocks do not fail or break but slide on either fractured or pre-cut, prepared surfaces with or without an intervening layer of granular material called gouge by analogy with natural faults (e g , [1])  the coefficient of sliding friction is represented by the stress across the sliding surface, specifically the shear stress parallel to the sliding direction divided by the normal stress on the surface  friction tests can be conducted on unconfined or confined samples  the normal load in unconfined tests is limited by the fracture strength of the rock blocks, typically on the order of 50 mpa  in confined tests, samples are sealed in an impermeable membrane and surrounded by a pressurized gas or a fluid at a confining pressure, pc  confined tests simulate the high pressure condition at depth in the earth where an earthquake occurs  samples also may be permeated by a fluid, normally water, at a pore fluid pressure, pp   recent experimental investigations of friction in rock and gouge appropriate to earthquake slip using high-speed apparatus demonstrate pronounced reduction in the apparent coefficient of friction at seismic slip rates greater than 0 1 m/s, which likely reflects lubrication by generation of melt or ultrafine wear particles, thermalchemical processes such as flash heating and thermal decomposition, and dynamic thermal fluid pressurization within thin slip zones  recent past and current development of testing devices is aimed at improving our ability to investigate coseismic friction weakening at all conditions of earthquake rupture (specifically slip velocity, normal stress, fluid states, ambient temperature) and develop relations for scaling (spatial and temporal) laboratory results to natural earthquake faulting | 
2015-436 	 rate type isotach compaction of consolidated sandstone |abstract  laboratory experiments on samples from a consolidated sandstone reservoir are presented that demonstrate rate type compaction behaviour similar to that observed on unconsolidated sands and soils  such rate type behaviour can have large consequences for reservoir compaction, surface subsidence and induced seismicity resulting from oil and gas production  during traditional single loading rate laboratory experiments, the effect of loading rate on uniaxial compressibility can be ignored to first approximation  in contrast, strongly non-linear compaction occurs when stepwise increases or decreases in loading rate are applied within a loading cycle, during loading after creep or during loading after partial unloading  a modified version of the rtcm rate type compaction model, built on dieterich’s rate and state friction equation describes the experimental results well  the new isotach version solves a number of limitations of the original model at the cost of an additional parameter that specifies the split between direct (elastic) and secular (creep) strain  the good fits between the updated model and the experimental data suggest that rate and state friction - e g  on sliding contact surfaces between assemblies of cemented grains or on sliding micro-cracks - causes the observed non-linear compaction  the same rate and state friction phenomena have been linked to the non-linear rate-dependent earthquake generation in volcanism-induced seismicity, suggesting similar rate dependence for the induced seismicity in depleting oil and gas fields    1  introduction  production of gas from the large groningen field in the netherlands causes surface subsidence as predicted prior to the start of production [1]  above the centre of the field the subsidence is now some 35 cm, important for a country like the netherlands which would largely flood without the presence of dykes and active pumping  as for a number of other oil and gas fields [2, 3] subsidence in groningen was initially much lower than expected based on measurements carried out on samples taken from the reservoir  as for other fields the subsidence later accelerated, coming closer to values expected and leading to the notion of “delayed subsidence” [2]  during the stage of accelerated subsidence, shallow earthquakes started to occur in groningen that have been increasing in numbers and strength over time (fig  1 )  an example is the strongest tremor so far with a magnitude of 3 6 that occurred near the village of huizinge in 2012, causing damage to thousands of homes and raising anxiety among those living on or near the field [4]  the mechanism behind the earthquakes is understood to be (differential) compaction at reservoir level reactivating larger faults with substantial offset [5]  better understanding of the physics of these processes is important to predict the further evolution of the groningen subsidence and to find out if it is possible to influence the level of seismicity by production changes  rate and state friction has been proposed as an explanation for the observed non-linear compaction behaviour of the groningen field [6, 7]  the same rate and state friction phenomena have been linked to rate-dependent earthquake generation [8, 9]  hence a number of laboratory experiments, previously carried out to study the effects of changes in loading rate on the compaction behaviour of groningen reservoir rock, have been re-analysed using a modified (isotach) formulation of the rate type compaction model [10] with the hope to derive new insights into the physics of reservoir compaction and induced earthquake generation | 
2015-437 	 stress-dependent permeability model of laminated gas shale |abstract  this paper presents a model of the stress and pore-pressure dependence of permeability in organic-rich shale rocks such as gas shales, which are porous media that consist of (at least) two constituents – kerogen (organic) and inorganic matter – with significantly different mechanical properties  the model treats these organic-rich rocks as porous media in which both organic and inorganic constituents have laminar morphology  this leads to a more complicated dependence of permeability rather than that of differential (terzaghi) effective stress, i e  confining stress minus pore pressure as in the case of one-solid constituent porous medium  the model provides a better description of effective stress, and better explains the dynamic impact of geomechanical stresses on key production parameters such as porosity and permeability  comparison of this model with classical theories and limited experimental results is performed  this new model is a generalization of the earlier developed spherical composite model [1] for more realistic laminated texture of gas shale rock  additional dependence of permeability on pore pressure is captured by taking into account knudsen flow contributions  the model provides basis for estimation of maximum drawdown which still avoids collapse of porosity and permeability of softer organic constituent    1  introduction  gas shale rock has at least two distinct solid constituents, which are organic and inorganic matter  the most important mechanical difference is that the organic matter is significantly softer (approximately four times, see [1, 2]) than the inorganic matter  it may cause a noticeable difference in stress values in organic matter and inorganic matter  in turn this feature leads to different evolution of porosity and permeability in the different solid constituents  | 
2015-438 	 screening of the eor potential of a wolfcamp shale oil reservoir |abstract  the current technique to produce shale oil is through primary depletion using horizontal wells with multiple transverse fractures  the oil recovery in oil-bearing shale reservoirs may be less than 10%, which leaves a large percentage of the oil unrecoverable without enhanced oil recovery methods  however, there is no eor method tested or implemented in shale oil reservoirs  before testing an eor method, feasible methods need to be screened    in this paper a screen study was first conducted to analyze the feasibility of every eor method for a wolfcamp shale oil reservoir  actual reservoir and fluid data, and field operational parameters were used  the study shows that water injection and gas injection are most feasible eor methods  after that, a detailed simulation study was carried out to evaluate the potentials of water and gas injection  the model was calibrated with the actual reservoir performance data  waterflooding, cyclic water injection, gas flooding and cyclic gas injection were evaluated  the results show that cyclic gas injection provides the highest eor potential for this reservoir  simulation results indicate that the oil recovery factor can be increased more than one time by gas injection  this study provides a justification for a possible field implementation in the shale reservoir  it also provides a guide for the eor screening in shale oil reservoirs   1  introduction  unconventional shale reservoirs are generally produced by stimulation techniques  a horizontal well with multiple transverse fractures has proven to be an effective technique for shale gas and shale oil production  however, shale oil production faces more challenges compared with shale gas production  even applying multi-stage hydraulic fracturing techniques, the final oil recovery factors using existing methods are only a few percent  oil rate and reservoir pressure drop very quickly  because most of oil remains unrecoverable even using the expensive horizontal well drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing, seeking the ways to enhance oil recovery will be the continuous efforts  | 
2015-439 	 a 2d experimental method with results for hydraulic fractures crossing discontinuities |abstract  experimental methods and results are presented for two-dimensional (2d) hydraulic fracturing experiments investigating the interaction and crossing of a hydraulic fracture with a pre-existing frictional discontinuity  the 2d experimental results include direct viewing and measurement of fracture path along with fracture and interface displacement  these data are compared directly to results from a 2d numerical hydraulic fracture model  the 2d experimental method involves propagating a hydraulic fracture from the centre of a 350 by 350 by 50 mm rock sample  transparent shims are used to transmit the normal stress to the face of the sample and allow continuous digital video records to be made of the fracture growth and fracture interaction with the orthogonal discontinuity  displacement of a grid drawn onto the sample face is measured by optical analysis methods, allowing the fracture and interface opening to be measured to better than 10-micron resolution  the data provide information about fracture crossing/arresting, path, and fracture and interface displacement with time  the numerical model matched the experiment in the sense of correctly predicting crossing in one case and blunting in the other  the model was unable to match the pressure from the experiments in siltstone, primarily because of not including effects from the pump and injection system compliance   1  introduction  the mechanics involved in a hydraulic fracture interacting with a natural fracture have been extensively studied over the past years because this process produces a number of first order effects on fracture growth  the crossing interaction can result in branching, offsetting, and even blunting of the hydraulic fracture tip, significantly changing the fracture growth, excess pressure, and width  a verified method to predict the outcome of a crossing interaction is therefore necessary in any fracture stimulation model intended for design and post-treatment analysis of hydraulic fractures placed in naturally fractured rock  this paper is primarily concerned with describing and illustrating the use of a new experimental method that allows two dimensional hydraulic fractures to be grown and studied as they interact with a frictional interface  therefore, only a brief review of previous work on the topic of hydraulic fractures interacting with frictional discontinuities is provided | 
2015-440 	 long-term modeling of coupled processes in a generic salt repository for heat-generating nuclear waste: preliminary analysis of the impacts of halite dissolution and precipitation |abstract  we present preliminary simulation results of coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical-chemical processes in saliferous formations in the context of underground disposal of heat-generating nuclear waste in rock salt with crushed salt backfill  the work presented in this paper is the continuation of recent work in which the effects of halite dissolution/precipitation were not considered  the simulations have been performed using tough-flac, with an equation-of-state module that effectively considers fluids of variable salinity  the preliminary results presented suggest that the backfill reconsolidation process is not affected noticeably when halite dissolution/precipitation is accounted for (in particular, time for reconsolidation and final porosities reached)  concerning the natural salt, the most important effect is related to the increasing solubility of halite with temperature, which affects the effective porosity  assuming that porosity changes due to chemical effects influence permeability, our simulation results suggest that the extension of the area affected by a secondary permeability is greater when dissolution/precipitation is considered  these results are preliminary and should be validated based on experimental evidence  the time frame during which chemical effects have a noticeable impact is dependent upon the heat power released by the waste packages, and extends between 10 and 100-200 years in the scenario investigated    1  introduction  rock salt is a potential medium for the underground disposal of nuclear waste because of several favorable properties: undisturbed rock salt is water and gas tight, it has very low porosity and high thermal conductivity as compared to other shallow-crustal rock types  in addition, rock salt shows creep behavior and is able to heal technically induced fractures if the stress regime is propitious [1-4]  moreover, rock salt is usually found underground in large volumes in geologically stable areas and is easy to mine [5]  the run-of-mine salt can be used to backfill the open mined spaces (crushed salt backfill, with average grain size smaller than 50- 60 mm [6]) | 
2015-441 	 rock slope instability modeling analysis and mitigation at mountainous road, and prediction of debris flows utilizing the satellite image, saudi arabia |abstract  construction of mountain roads at western saudi arabia is a challenge, where the rock masses are high-rising, steep slopes  al-hada mountain road of almost 22 km long shows many incidents of rockfalls  a studied 100 m long portion of mountain road lie along a man-made and natural sharp slope cut suffers from slope failures, rockfalls incidents, mainly in rainy seasons  the igneous rock masses are medium quality  the 40 m-height rock slope-cut along the road has no benches  the steep man-made rock slope cut is very close to the road, forming a potentially source for rockfalls  the swedge, roctopple, and rocfall computer program utilized to perform modeling and mitigation of the rock slope  no remedial measures taken to prevent the debris flows to take place  input parameters such as block size, seeder point’s locations of blocks falls, slope angle, restitution coefficients, and slope roughness used to model the rock mass characteristics such as strength, bounce height, kinetic energies, and translational and rotational velocities  modeling of the input parameters indicates the increase of the hit energy and end-point of rockfalls as the block size and slope angle increases    1  introduction  the slope failures, landslides and rockfalls frequently occur along mountain roads in rugged terrains  one of the most difficult terrains in western saudi arabia is the al-hada descent (fig  1)  the famous al-hada descent lies at the upstream high elevation region of wadi na’man in the western part of the kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa), which known as arabian shield  the elevations at the top of the al-hada road reach almost 2,000 m a m s l  and its alignment lies within the sharp cliff edges of the sarawat mountains at the highest elevations  before ascend the road starts from about 500 m elevation and reaches to more than 2,000 m, in a number of road twists | 
2015-444 	 injection induced fracturing as a necessary evil in geologic co2 sequestration |abstract  the fracturing of any component of the co2 storage system is generally viewed as a liability to be avoided  yet in large-scale ccs, injection-induced fracturing of the storage reservoir is almost a certainty, even when operators keep injection pressures below the nominal fracture gradient  models and field data indicate that pipeline-delivered co2 will still be relatively cool when it enters the reservoir  the consequent thermoelastic stress reduces the fluid pressure needed to fracture the reservoir, so much so that commercial injection rates will not be possible if fracturing is prohibited  simple models show that the co2 does not warm significantly within the fracture, but the injection-induced fracture nevertheless propagates only a finite distance into the storage reservoir because friction within the fracture reduces the fluid pressure at the fracture tip  this prediction is consistent with field observations of injectivity  such self-limiting propagation is useful for increasing the rate of storage and need not jeopardize the containment of the co2, especially if injection is coupled with pressure management via extraction wells  we present field data from water flooded oil reservoirs that support this assertion    1  introduction  geological co2 sequestration (gcs) in deep saline aquifer is one of the most promising techniques for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but its potential strongly depends on large injection rates, long term storage security and low-cost operations [1]  an important regulation of gcs could be the constraint on the injection pressure to be below the formation breakdown pressure [2]  yet even if the pressure constraint is met, injection-induced fractures can still occur in the storage reservoir  one reason is the reduction of tangential stress caused by injecting cool fluid into a warm reservoir [3-5]  when the temperature of injection fluid is significantly lower than the formation temperature at the bottomhole of injection well, the superposition of thermoelastic stress greatly reduces the tangential stress around the wellbore, allowing initiation of a tensile fracture at fluid pressures below nominal fracture pressure [6]  | 
2015-449 	 investigation of sequential and simultaneous well completion in horizontal wells using a non-planar, fully coupled hydraulic fracture simulator |abstract  economical production of shale resources requires drilling horizontal wellbores with either sequential or zipper-frac completion in order to increase the fracture complexity in tight reservoirs  properly estimating the final fracture geometry is the primary challenge in these compound fracturing practices  various parameters control the fracture geometry including: fracture spacing, in-situ differential stress, pump rate and fluid viscosity  two important fracture characteristic that should be addressed in such a complex system in order to have a proper estimation about fracture geometry, are fracture height and out of plane propagation  although the modeling of hydraulically driven fractures in such a medium has been advanced over the past decades, there have been a few attempts to investigate these two phenomena together in an implicit model   this article advances a hydraulic fracture model that predicts single and multi-fracture propagation  the model simultaneously simulates the dynamic growth of multiple fractures while addressing the stress interference between the fractures and its effect on fracture propagation  the hydraulic fracture model is based on displacement discontinuity method for simulating fracture propagation in multi-fracture systems  using the simulator, variations in the parameters affecting the behavior of hydraulic fractures were explored  the simulator is able to predict non-planar fracture propagation due to stress interference between adjacent fractures  for studying fracturing fluid, fluid flow equations are solved using finite difference and are fully coupled with geomechanical solver  the effect on fracture propagation from variations in fluid viscosity, injection rate, stress interference, fracture spacing, stress anisotropy and perforation direction are presented for a multi fracture system   the result of this study indicates that stress shadowing is the main factor affecting hydraulic fracture propagation  it changes the direction and magnitude of the principal stresses around fractures and may cause early screen out or tortuosity in fractures created from single or multiple wells  therefore, an optimized fracture spacing is needed for placing more fracture into the system  the results of this study would help operators to better optimize the fracture spacing in horizontal wellbores and maximize the complexity needed for a typical horizontal fracturing job  | 
2015-450 	 model test of deformation and failure mechanism of shield tunnel passed through ground fracture with small angle |abstract  the segment lining structure physical modeling experiment of shield tunnel cross the ground fissure with 30° is designed according to the similarity theory, which based on the xi’an metro engineering and the geological environment of xi’an ground fissure  the strain of segment concrete, longitudial bolt, and circumferential bolt, the contact soil pressure and peripheral soil pressure, convergence displacement of segment lining, the soil settlement on the top of model and other macrophenomena show that the main deformation and damage modes of segment lining structure of shield tunnel cross the ground fissure with 30° is shearing with distortion on local; the deformation and damage range is from 1 25d (d is the external diameter of segment ring) in the hanging side to 0 75d in the lying side; the deformation and damage of segment ring is asymmetric and partial compressive; the dislocation of circumferential seam on the soffit which is up to 40mm(0 033d) is bigger than that of crown and arch waist  it is difficult for the model to apply the 20cm(0 1667d) deformation of ground fissure, and the segment lining structure of shield tunnel is unsuitable to the geological environment with violent activity of ground fissure    1  introduction  shield tunnel structure is widely used in the urban area, because of its small influence to the surrounding environment, little pollution and fast speed  lining segment structure of shield tunnel belongs to flexible structure  its deformation in response to the force, because of the subside of stiffness of bolt joint, is clearly different from the integral tunnel lining structure  furthermore, due to the special geological environment, there are more than 10 existing ground fissures in xi’an area and their activity is in progress at present[1]  lining segment structure of tunnel is potentially in great danger  the angle of intersection and the distance between the ground fractures greatly affect the severity of the damage  at the same time, the stiffness and strength of the structure also play an important role on the extent and other regularity of damage | 
2015-456 	 development of an exploration, design, and construction system for bedrock reinforcement considering geology at the tunnel |abstract  the primary concern when constructing underground spaces for dumping and storing high-level radioactive waste deeper than 300 m in the earth, and when constructing tunnels for the linear chuo shinkansen 1000 m below earth cover, is space destabilization due to high ground pressure or sudden water leakage  therefore, it is necessary to take measures to assure construction safety and maintain the stability of the underground space for as long a time as possible  to achieve this, we built a new exploration, design, and construction system that can be used for evaluating the underground space more efficiently and effectively using a crack density diagram to calculate the rock bolt direction that will best intersect with cracks  in this paper, the authors show the specific content of this system and analyze the results of the evaluation in detail to verify their validity   1  introduction  the primary concern when constructing underground spaces for dumping and storing high-level radioactive waste deeper than 300 m in the earth, and when constructing tunnels for the linear chuo shinkansen 1000 m below earth cover, is space destabilization due to high ground pressure or sudden water leakage  therefore, it is necessary to take measures to assure construction safety and maintain the stability of the underground space for as long a time as possible  furthermore, these structures should be sound and have a quality higher than is required in the construction of ordinary underground structures  simultaneously, the reduction of construction costs is very important; this means that more efficient and effective designs and construction methods are required    for this, the authors developed a grouting quality control system (japanese patent publication number 2013-221298) to provide the best water stopping measures, which differ according to the geological features present, and applied it to the construction of a dam1) and examined the applicability to underground space construction 2) to provide the best water stopping measures possible according to the geological features, this system combines the use of (1) a crack density diagram to calculate the direction of the drilled injection holes that will best intersect with extant cracks and (2) a method to draw a contour plot of rock water channels based on the results of geostatistical analyses | 
2015-458 	 dem simulation of brazilian tensile failure of hard rock in consideration of element configuration |abstract  the particle flow code (pfc) is a useful tool for simulating the failure behavior of hard rocks  the introduction of clump logic into the pfc modeling has made it possible to better reproduce the brittleness characteristic of hard rocks, namely, the large difference between compressive strength and tensile strength  however, there is a problem in the pfc simulation with the clumped particle model, namely, when we simulate brazilian tensile tests on hard rocks, the results do not fully express the rapid decrease in tensile stress after the peak stress  one reason for this problem is the existence of clumps that block the rapid propagation and the connection of the micro-cracks in the model by their interlocking effect  focusing on the effect of clump configuration on the brazilian tensile failure behavior of hard rocks, this paper carried out simulations by varying clump and ball size  the experimental mechanical properties of lac du bonnet granite were targeted in the simulations  from the simulation results, we confirmed that brittleness can be controlled by changing the ratio of clump size to minimum ball size and that under a constant ratio of clump size to minimum ball size, the local peak stress does not change with the minimum ball size    1  introduction  the particle flow code (pfc), a numerical simulation code based on the distinct element method (dem), is an effective numerical tool for simulating the failure process of hard rocks  by introducing the contact- and parallel-bond and clumped particle model (cho et al , 2007 [1]), pfc has become better able to express the brittle failure of hard rocks (e g , funatsu et al , 2008 [2])  on the other hand, a problem has been pointed out, namely, that a pfc simulation with the clumped particle model cannot reproduce the rapid strain-softening behavior in brazilian tensile tests (inoue et al , 2009 [3]; nakashima et al , 2011, 2013 [4, 5])  in addition, the cracks generated in the simulation are too widely distributed in the specimen compared to those in experiments  this problem should be overcome before handling actual excavation problems, firstly because the stress field generated around real underground cavities may be more complicated than that of the brazilian tensile condition, and secondly because brazilian tests and uniaxial compression tests are the most commonly used element tests to calibrate the input parameters of a pfc simulation  if brazilian tests are not simulated with adequate accuracy, reliable input parameters cannot be obtained to model the targeted rock | 
2015-460 	 development of soil-water coupled nmm-dda |abstract  in order to simulate the behavior of composite structures consisting of discontinuous blocks on the saturated ground, a soil-water coupled code based on nmm-dda (coupled numerical manifold method and discontinuous deformation analysis) for saturated ground was newly developed  the code consists of three governing equations, the equation of motion for the dda part, the equilibrium equation and the continuity equation for the nmm part  in the formulation, the first and the second equations were combined using the contact treatment with the penalty method similarly to the original nmm-dda  then, the equilibrium equation and the continuity equation for the nmm region was coupled with the effective stress concept based on u-p formulation  this coupling formulation enables the stability analysis of masonry structure on the saturated ground  as a verification of newly developed simulation code, one-dimensional consolidation analysis was carried out  the simulation results showed good agreement with the analytical solution of terzaghi’s consolidation equation, and the validity of the new code was confirmed    1  introduction  there are many geotechnical engineering problems significantly affected by geometrical discontinuity, although the soil mechanics is usually discussed based on the continuum mechanics  a typical example is the stability problem of masonry or concrete block structures constructed on a soil foundation  fig  1 is a historic masonry building in cambodia which foundation ground showed uneven settlement due to the self-weight of the structure [1]  the building was inclined because of the settlement, and some joint openings appeared on the wall  the mechanical behavior of this kind of structure is governed by mutual interaction between discontinuous structural members, interaction on the ground-structure interface, and the deformation of the ground  additionally, when a structure was constructed on a ground which may shows consolidation phenomenon, generation and dissipation of excess pore water pressure will have much impact on the long-term deterioration process of the structure  since it is difficult to solve such a complicated problem theoretically, development of numerical methods which can consider above factors is demanded for the stability evaluation  in this paper, as a method which satisfy the requirements mentioned above, a soil-water coupled analysis code based on nmm-dda [2], one of the discontinuum based numerical methods, was newly developed  | 
2015-462 	 experimental study on loading-unloading failure process of marble in jinping ii hydropower station, china |abstract  a serials of loading-unloading experiments of marble in jinping ii hydropower station, china, are carried out to investigate its failure mechanism under complex stress condition  it is found that, the marble failure process is divided into five stages, including initial crack closure, linear elastic stage, damage development, macro-crack development and rock structure stage  during the initial crack closure stage, different confining pressures produce different initial crack volumetric strain and different compressible extents of initial crack which indicates the dominant effect of confining pressure during the initial crack closure stage  the results obtained from confining pressure reduction test show that the inflection point of volumetric strain of jinping ii marble always lags behind the unloading point and the macro failure happens at 80%-95% of peak stress  this behavior plays an important role to control the support time when tunnels are excavated and provides a theoretical basis for preventing the failure of hard rock under loading-unloading condition    1  introduction  with the development of human's society, the scarcity of energy becomes increasingly serious  jinping ii hydropower station in china [1,2], was built to solve part of the energy problem  with the excavation of tunnels, some complex mechanical behaviors, such as highly nonlinearity, discontinuity and anisotropy, of the deep-seated marbles were exhibited  therefore, it's important to study the behavior of marble in jinping ii hydropower station which will help us to understand its complex failure mechanism   in this paper, a serials of loading-unloading experiments of jinping marble were conducted  the volumetric strain, crack volumetric strain, equivalent plastic strain and the relation of stress-strain are combined to analyze its failure mechanism  especially, the crack volumetric strain can reflect the damage development in the rock  this variable first introduced by cd  martin[3-5] and then widely used to study on the deep-seated rock by many researchers[6-11]  however, the variable is rarely used to study on the mechanical behavior of rocks under loading-unloading conditions  | 
2015-463 	 multiscale characterization of physical, chemical, and mechanical heterogeneity of mudstones |abstract  multiscale characteristics of anisotropic, heterogeneous pore structure and compositional (e g , kerogen, clay, cement, etc) distribution profoundly influence the hydro, mechanical, and chemical response of shale materials during stimulation and production  in this work the impact of these lithologic heterogeneities on physical, chemical, and mechanical properties is investigated over a micron to core scale of shale samples for cretaceous mancos shale  principal macroscopic lithofacies at a decimeter scale are petrographically examined  thin sections (~2-3cm ) impregnated with fluorochromes are examined using laser scanning confocal microscopy and optical microscopy with different filters to characterize micro-facies (i e , texture patterns) and using electron microprobe to identify the mineralogical distribution  advanced multiscale image analysis for texture classification will be used to identify key features of samples which will be further analyzed using dual focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy, aberration corrected-scanning tem and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry for nano-pore and organic-pore structures and mineralogies at nano scale  this characterization will be examined against experimental data including acoustic emission and nano-indentation measurements of elastic properties using focused ion-beam milled pillars  finally, multiscale 3-d image stacks will be segmented to rigorously test the scale of a representative elementary volume based on multiple measures from image analysis and pore-scale simulations    1  introduction  shale gas recovery relies on the combined horizontal drilling and hydrofracturing, or “fracking” technologies, required to produce sufficient permeable pathways for gas to flow from these low permeability formations  production rates progressively decline from slow diffusive transport in nanometer-sized pores, closure/collapse of fractures, and other factors [1]  shales are unique among rock types and pose challenges for continuum scale modeling  this is both due to the low permeability, scaling of pore sizes, and compositional heterogeneity at all scales [2,3]  multiscale characteristics of anisotropic, heterogeneous pore structure and compositional (e g , kerogen, clay, cement, etc) distribution are critical to improving our understanding of large heterogeneity and variability between shale formations, uncertainties in the nature of the stimulated volumes, and the physics of what underlies the rapid decline in production rates  in this work the impact of these lithologic heterogeneities on physical, chemical, and mechanical properties is being investigated over a micron to core scale of shale samples for cretaceous mancos shale | 
2015-464 	 discrete modeling of multiple discontinuities in rock mass using xfem |abstract  modeling of discontinuities (fractures and fault surfaces) is of major importance to assess the geomechanical behavior of oil and gas reservoirs, especially for tight and unconventional reservoirs  numerical analysis of discrete discontinuities traditionally has been studied using interface element concepts, however more recently there are attempts to use extended finite element method (xfem)  the development of an xfem tool for geo-mechanical fractures/faults modeling has significant industrial potential; particularly within the hydrocarbon industry where it could lead to improved predictions for porosity/permeability changes in coupled geomechanical reservoirs  in this paper, we present a novel methodology based on the extended finite element method (xfem) to analyze the behavior of pre-existing multiple strong discontinuities (faults and/or fractures) in reservoir rock  detailed mathematical framework leveraging xfem for multiple discontinuities in rock masses has been derived  this xfem based framework is robust enough to represent strong discontinuities independently of the mesh  the approximation of discontinuities is constructed in terms of heaviside/junction functions which lead to additional unknowns to capture the displacement jump across and at intersections of joints  our framework and algorithm are general in nature and can handle complex geo-mechanical problems with different loading conditions  for validation of the implemented mathematical framework using xfem, we analyze the behavior of a rock sample with multiple discontinuities and compare displacement and stress with known theoretical solution  triaxial3d loading examples involving multiple discontinuities are also presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology    1  introduction  modeling of big faults or planes of strong discontinuities is of major importance to assess the geomechanical behaviour of reservoirs  the presence of such discontinuities in rock mass possesses common characteristics on strength, deformability and development of a sudden jump in displacement field across the discontinuity and hence needs special attention for its inclusion in continuum mechanics  numerical techniques to capture discontinuities basically fall into two categories depending on how the interface is represented: on the one hand, we have the explicit representation methods, such as the interface element methods and some possible related variants with classical references [1, 2], in which the fault is explicitly discretized with special elements inserted in-between element faces/edges  in this case additional degrees of freedom are introduced at the nodes to capture the discontinuous behaviour of the displacement field | 
2015-467 	 numerical study on long-time deformation characteristics of soft clay around subway tunnel under train vibration load |abstract  in recent years, subway has developed rapidly in many cities of china  however, the environmental problems caused by train vibration load, such as the large settlement of surrounding ground around tunnels, can’t be ignored  the subway tunnels in shanghai mainly lie in the 3rd layer of muddy-silty clay or the 4th layer of muddy clay  these two layers of clay were especially soft and sensitive to vibration load  in this paper, a numerical study on long-time deformation characteristics of soft clay around the tunnel of shanghai metro line 9 under train vibration load was presented  the numerical simulation adopted an elasticplastic constitutive model that can take into account the long-term accumulation of soil deformation and excess pore water pressure under a huge number of cyclic loadings  the simulated results, including long-time displacement of soils around the tunnel, ground surface subsidence, and the variation of excess pore water pressure, were analyzed and discussed  the final settlement of surrounding ground was predicted through analyzing the variation tendency of maximum vertical displacement of soil  by comparing the simulated results and the measured data, it was proved that the simulated results were consistent with the measured data  therefore, the long-term deformation of soil around subway tunnels under vibration load can be evaluated and predicted by the numerical method presented in this paper   1  introduction  metro has become an important part of urban public traffic because of the less occupation of land and space, fast speed and little pollution  subway effectively eases the pressure on increasingly overloaded urban traffic and expands the available space in the city  according to statistics, the total length of metro lines has reached 1200km in china  in addition, a large number of city’s metro construction projects have been approved  with the rapid development of city rail traffic, a new round of metro construction boom will inevitably be set off  but the environmental problems caused by city rail traffic construction cannot be ignored  among the problems, environmental impact of vibration induced by metro is particularly significant | 
2015-469 	 assessment of stress changes in hydrocarbon reservoirs using analytical methods |abstract  in the petroleum industry, the stress evolution is considered a key factor to understand the geomechanical behaviour of hydrocarbon production fields  inside the reservoir, changes of stresses have been linked with uniform changes of pore pressure through simple relationships, called reservoir stress paths  however, the stress evolution can also be affected by the mechanical properties and the reservoir geometry  analytical solutions have been proposed for ellipsoidal reservoir shapes  enhanced methods based on the theory of nucleus of strain have been developed for arbitrary three-dimensional reservoir shapes, but they cannot provide results inside the reservoir  to overcome this limitation, this paper presents a methodology to assess the evolution of displacements, strains and stresses both outside and inside the reservoir  as an application of this methodology, a synthetic model considering a thick cylindrical reservoir submitted to uniform and non-uniform depletion is shown  the results are discussed through the identification of different geomechanical behaviour inside and outside of the reservoir  nevertheless, this methodology can be applied to arbitrary reservoir shapes, providing an alternative tool which properly extends the concept of reservoir stress paths to reservoir stress changes    1  introduction  in overall, changes in reservoir pore pressure due to fluid production or injection induce stress changes within the reservoir and its surrounding rocks  these stress changes lead to reservoir swelling or compaction, which in turn can trigger potential geomechanical problems such as surface subsidence, fault reactivation, pore collapse, casing deformation and seismicity    inside the reservoir, changes in the horizontal and vertical stresses have been linked with uniform changes in pore pressure through simple relationships, called reservoir stress paths  in general, it is assumed that the reservoir supports the overburden pressure completely  consequently, the vertical stress path is disregarded and the horizontal stress path occurs under uniaxial deformation  according to goulty [1], in the reservoir rock three mechanisms can provide different approaches to the horizontal stress path: normal compaction, poroelastic behaviour and normal faulting  | 
2015-474 	 micro-seismic monitoring of pdc bit drilling performance during vibration assisted rotational drilling |abstract  this study is an evaluation of the feasibility of real-time drilling performance monitoring using a near-bit ae detection tool in drilling with pdc drag bits under laboratory conditions to investigate an improved drilling performance with a new vibration assisted rotational drilling tool  this paper focuses on calibrating the micro-seismic response to rock failure mechanisms, improved rate of penetration (rop) and cutting particle-size distribution  concrete cylinders with comparable properties to natural rock were fabricated in the laboratory  drill-off tests (dot) were conducted under rigid and compliant drilling with a two-cutter pdc bit  simultaneously, micro-crack acoustic emissions (ae) from the bit-rock interaction process were monitored by four symmetrically mounted non-destructive testing (ndt) sensors  the fracture characteristics were investigated by analyzing acoustic events in terms of event occurrence rate, and average event energy  analysis from the dot indicates that some factors are correlated with improved drilling performance, including particle-size distribution, vibration compliance setting and acoustic emission  a stronger vibration compliance setting increases rop by increasing cutting depth per revolution and bigger cuttings are generated  higher average event energy corresponds to bigger cracking when cracking event rate increases  all of this has contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms of improved drilling performance    1  introduction  one of the major problems for field drilling engineers is how to drill to target formations fast and safely  in drilling subsurface formations a vertical oscillation generator was found to increase penetration rate [1] and this early stage of oscillation vibrator drilling was called resonant sonic drilling  after that, both surface and offshore mechanical vibrator were introduced [2]  vertical vibration applied to a bit leads to fluctuations in wob which interact with rock  a new vibration tool developed in the advanced drilling laboratory (adl) at memorial university was tested for improving rop [3, 4]  laboratory tests have shown that controlled amplitude and frequencies of vibration are available from this vibration tool and the effect of vibration on drilling efficiency and penetration rate was investigated   micro seismic events, or acoustic emission (ae), are the elastic waves produced when rock undergoes internal change, such as micro crack initialization and propagation  in non-destructive testing (ndt), piezoelectric transducers are commonly employed in detecting and monitoring micro crack propagation  as an alternative way to ‘see’ micro crack initiation and propagation, ae detection has been applied in triaxial compression tests to monitor the whole deformation process [5]  some ae parameters such as dominant frequency, event energy and cumulative emission counts are related to the different deformation stages  numerical simulation with pfc2d models has been used to simulate ucs tests to predict rock failure [6, 7]  in this pfc model, hit number is scaled by counting crack number under tri-axial compression tests  ae detection is commonly used in hydraulic fracturing (hf) researches  fluids has been injected at high pressure into cylindrical rock to simulate hydraulic fracturing with ae detection of crack initiation and propagation [8]  | 
2015-477 	 ground subsidence model for a panel caving exploitation at el teniente mine - codelco chile |abstract  the generation of a subsidence crater on the surface derived from an underground mine exploitation, has been under study since the 70’s with works done by peck (1969), shandbolt (1978), kvapil et al (1989) and flores (2005), among the most famous  all these studies were developed using available observations together with the characterization of rock massifs and materials disposition, to elaborate rules that would allow the estimation of the extension of motion caused by the phenomena of subsidence    since 2010, el teniente mine of codelco – chile has been monitoring the ground subsidence generated by the underground exploitation using radar satellite data (insar) by applying methods based in differential interferometry (dinsar)  this has allowed obtaining accurate ground motion measurements over large extensions of land, which have been used to develop a behavior model that establishes a link cause-effect between the underground works and surface subsidence  this conceptual model represents a consistent relationship between underground mining and subsidence development on the surface    these analyses have been applied in the delineation of the subsidence effect and in the development of a conceptual model for the subsidence process that is generated by the phenomena from the base of the exploitation up to the surface  the results indicate a significant difference between the traditional estimation of subsidence angles and results obtained from insar technology  finally, the subsidence interpretation using interfereometric satellite methodologies show a reduction of the extension effect on the surface due to underground drawing with a consequent reduction in angles of breaking and influence    1  introduction  today, the availability of technologies such as insar, has allowed us to build digital terrain models (dtm) with high accuracy and updating periods in the order of 10 days  these measurements have been carried biannually since 2011 (due to the snow in winter no measurements are made) thus, to date there exist sufficient measurements with which to generate a model of behavior that allows estimation of the range of subsidence parameters as a function of mining, geotechnical and environmental efforts | 
2015-478 	 microseismicity induced in the opalinus clay by a gallery excavation in the mont terri underground rock laboratory |abstract  in the clay formation of the mont terri, we have performed acoustic experiments to monitor the excavation damaged zone induced in the surrounding of a new gallery ga08  the experiments took place in the end-face of a previous gallery ga04 with an excavation operation coming from the opposite direction to joint both galleries  the study dealt with the rock mass segment, 8 m in length, left for two weeks between the ga04 end-face and the ga08 excavation front  acoustic surveys, performed with a controlled acoustic source introduced inside the rock mass segment, allowed defining the transversely isotropic p-wave velocity field of the medium  passive acoustic measurements, which consisted in detecting induced acoustic events, allowed identifying actual microseismic events induced by stress redistribution in the surrounding of the ga08 excavation front  we assessed the damage mechanism of these events and clearly highlighted strong correlations between spatial, temporal and mechanism attributes, in agreement with both the geological facies and the gallery orientation with respect to geological preexisting features  finally, we present preliminary results on additional acoustic events located inside the rock mass segment   1  introduction  a large scale geological rock mass is subjected to different natural stresses, including tensional, compressive and shear stresses  the rock response to such ambient stress is controlled by the lithology, the pressure condition the rock is under, i e  the normal to horizontal stress ratio, and the time the rock is under stress  depending on these in situ conditions, which control the stress field, different damage structures may appear in the geological structure, including faults, fractures, cracks and/or crystal dislocations [1,2]    at short time and space scales, the stress field can be modified for instance when a gallery is excavated in such a stressed environment : it induces a stress redistribution in the vicinity of the excavation, in particular the so-called excavation damaged zone (edz) [3,4]  characterization of the edz, where plastic deformation occurs leading to significant hydromechanical changes [5], is of primary importance in many research topics related to underground galleries, in particular when dealing with deep geological repositories  indeed, damage structures constitute preferential pathways for radionuclides to reach the free surface or ground water reservoirs  in this context, clay formation are interesting for both its low permeability and its self-sealing capacity [4,6]  as a consequence, monitoring the edz in such geological formation is a major but not straightforward research field which motivate numerous in situ experiments in the underground research laboratory (url) of mont terri (switzerland), situated in the opalinus clay formation of the folded jura [7,8] | 
2015-479 	 testing methods for evaluating drilling fluid effects on gas shale stability |abstract  the shale gas boom has been a game changer for the energy industry  many drilling problems related to wellbore instability are caused by incompatibilities between the drilling fluid and the shale formations encountered  this problem is not new, and the drilling industry has developed many effective testing methods for evaluating the compatibility  however, these useful methods are not effective for unconventional resources, as unconventional shale is very different from traditional swelling shale  this paper presents recently developed testing methods for on unconventional shale  the new testing methods presented in this paper include: a) indentation test to evaluate shale mechanical property degradation as a function of drilling fluids’ chemistry and rheology over time; b) scratch test with repeated passes to evaluate the depth of shale mechanical property degradation; c) fluid penetration test to evaluate drilling fluids’ penetration rate into the shale and sealing of micro-fractures in fissile shale; d) wellbore stimulator to evaluate drilling fluids’ chemistry, rheology, and filtration effects on wellbore stability under downhole pressure and temperature  test results on the eagle ford and marcellus shale are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of these testing methods for evaluating drilling fluids’ effects on unconventional shale and wellbore stability    1  introduction  the shale gas and oil boom has been a game changer for the oil and gas industry, with an investment of billions of dollars and creation of over two million new jobs [1]  many thousands of shale gas and oil wells have been drilled every year  in the eagle ford shale play alone, over 4,000 new wells were drilled every year since 2012 [2]  much experience has been gained and much progress has been made from drilling such a large number of wells [3], resulting in improved drilling efficiency from year to year  wellbore or shale instability is still the largest cause of non-productive time in shale oil and gas drilling operations [3]  the design, evaluation, and selection of the most suitable drilling fluid is central to managing shale instability and to achieving drilling cost reduction   managing shale instability is not new to the drilling industry, yet oil/gas shale is quite different from traditional shale  the industry has been dealing with shale instability since the beginning of oil well drilling and has developed many effective and fit-for-purpose testing methods for testing and evaluating shale and fluid interaction [4]  these methods are often effective and useful in selecting the most suitable drilling fluid for highly or moderately reactive shale  when these traditional methods are applied to oil and gas shale, little or no differences with various fluids are seen from the traditional tests, resulting in the conclusion, according to conventional understanding and knowledge, that gas or oil shale is non-reactive shale and drilling fluids do not make a difference  drilling experience in unconventional resources showed a clear difference of drilling fluids on wellbore stability and non-productive time [3, 5, 6]  | 
2015-480 	 underground research laboratories for conducting fault activation experiments in shales |abstract  since a decade, observations and experiments conducted in underground environments worldwide (mines, underground research laboratories - url) allowed to bridge the scale gap between laboratory scale and large scale faults  this is particularly important in the study of faults affecting clay formations which could not be observed at the earth’s surface because of weathering processes  here we show how examples from the mont terri (switzerland) and tournemire (france) urls may help in (i) defining the concepts of fault architecture in shales, and (ii) estimating fault hydromechanical properties from decameter scale field experiments  some key results are that critically stressed shale faults can be reactivated with little stress changes in the range of those produced by shallow underground excavations, and that micrometer-to-millimeter scale reactivations may lead to an increased permeability of one order of magnitude without generating any noticeable seismicity  this appears to be related to complex multi-scale geological processes linked to fault history such as differential hardening, partial sealing, pressure solution and gouge development within the fault zones rather than to the regional state of stress  such results are important in evaluating fault seal integrity in oil and gas exploration, production or co2 storage or monitoring underground excavations for deep geological repositories    1  introduction  little is known about the rock mechanical characteristics of pre-existing tectonic faults and their influence on rock mass properties and behavior in clay rocks  underground research laboratories provide exceptional conditions to observe unaltered fault zones in shales and to perform relatively well constrained experiments  studies on induced macroscopic fracturing around tunnels in faulted shale indicate that reactivation of tectonic faults as a consequence of excavation-induced stress redistributions play an essential role in the development of the excavation damage zone (edz) fracture network [1-4]  hence, faults significantly alter the homogeneity of the rock mass in strength, stress and deformability, and thus have a significant effect on induced fracturing  | 
2015-481 	 assessment of the potential for induced seismicity at the cavone oilfield: analysis of structural and geophysical data, and geomechanical modeling |abstract  the occurrence of a sequence of damaging earthquakes in may 2012 near the cavone oil field, in northern italy, raised the question of whether these earthquakes might have been triggered by oil and gas activities, such as fluid extraction and injection  here, we analyze geologic and seismic reflection data along with previous studies to determine rates, patterns and modes of deformation recorded in the folds and faults that comprise the cavone structure, and examine the rate of ongoing deformation observed by gps, as well as the historical rate at which earthquakes comparable to the 2012 sequence have occurred   to estimate the change in reservoir pore pressure and stress on the regional faults due to oil production and water injection, we investigated the properties of the reservoir by means of well tests  interference tests carried out in 2014 at the cavone 14 injection well allowed us to constrain the range of values of reservoir permeability, and also suggested the presence of fractures intersecting the well that result in high transmissivity within a region of many tens of meters around the well  the interference tests also indicate the presence of geologic structures that impede flow at larger distances   here, we study, by way of numerical modeling and simulation, the potential for induced seismicity at the cavone oil field  using a coupled flow and geomechanics model of the field that honors reservoir geology and historical well schedule, we simulate oil production and water injection in the field for a period of three decades leading up to the earthquake sequence  we calculate the change in coulomb stress on the bounding mirandola fault, which sourced the may 29, 2012 m 5 8 earthquake  this quantity varies in space and evolves in time with changing pore pressure and total stress in the reservoir  a novel and important aspect of our work is the identification of a potential instability mechanism for a bounding fault at the edge of a reservoir experiencing pressure depletion  the discontinuity in pore pressure across the fault means that there is a discontinuity in effective normal stress and that, therefore, the coulomb failure criterion must be evaluated locally on both sides of the fault  we track the evolution of the coulomb stress at the hypocenter of the earthquake and compare it with the tectonic stressing rate in the region to conclude in favor of tectonic origin of the earthquake  in addition, analysis of the locations of aftershocks of the may 2012 sequence shows a lack of seismicity in the area where the stressing rates from contraction of the reservoir are largest  this observed lack of seismic activity within 1–2 km from the reservoir suggests that fluid production and injection from the cavone field was not an important driver for the observed seismicity | 
2015-484 	 relating static and dynamic mechanical anisotropies of shale |abstract  experimental studies of shale cores of different orientations have been performed to compare the angular dependence of dynamic moduli acquired at ultrasonic frequencies with static moduli (young’s moduli and poisson ratios) obtained during initial loading and during subsequent unload – reload cycles  the data show that the dynamic moduli by far exceed their static counterparts  dispersion explains part of this behavior: dynamic moduli measured at seismic (10 hz) frequency are significantly smaller than ultrasonic moduli, but reasonably similar to stiffnesses obtained from finite stress cycles  the difference between moduli obtained during initial loading and during stress cycles is largely caused by non-elastic behavior    1  introduction  while anisotropy has become state-of-the-art in geophysics for petroleum exploration and monitoring [1, 2], it is often neglected in geomechanical applications to petroleum engineering  for example, shales are known to exhibit pronounced anisotropy, which has significant impact on e g  hydraulic fracture growth and borehole instabilities caused by failure of rock around the hole   the incorporation of anisotropy in geomechanical analysis is however limited by availability of data: full anisotropic characterization requires either laboratory tests on several cores with different orientations, or procedures to convert anisotropic velocity data from seismic or sonic log data to static moduli  this is hampered by the fact that static and dynamic moduli may be quite different [3, 4], and that there is as yet no established theory that enables us to link the two sets of mechanical parameters  | 
2015-485 	 measurements of fracture aperture in granite core using microfocus x-ray ct and fluid flow simulation |abstract  in order to estimate the changes in fracture aperture under various long-term confining and thermal conditions, measurements of the fracture aperture are conducted using microfocus x-ray ct (µx-ray ct)  through the imaging data, the height of the fracture surface and the contact points are evaluated, and contact ratios for the fracture, the jrc and the aperture distribution are estimated  on the other hand, measurements are also conducted using a laser scan profile sensor, and some parameters are estimated  in comparing these parameters, the validity of the µx-ray ct data and an analysis of the data will be discussed  in addition, a fracture flow simulation will be conducted using the surface roughness and aperture data obtained by the µx-ray ct    1  introduction  it is well known that for a rock fracture under various thermal and stress conditions, a reduction in permeability occurs due to chemical and mechanical compaction  the chemical and mechanical compaction may include a pressure solution and a reduction in permeability could be explained by this pressure solution [1]-[5]  yasuhara, et al  [6] conducted flow-through experiments on a single fracture in granite under controlled temperature and stress conditions  specifically, two different experiments, short-term and long-term, were performed to examine the influence of the loading time on the evolution of fracture permeability  the measured changes in fracture permeability showed reversible and irreversible behaviors under short-term and long-term conditions, respectively  these results indicated that the surface roughness and the structure of a fracture may be changed by pressure solution  however, no change in the fracture structure could be directly obtained  a change in the hydraulic conductivity was indirectly obtained   the joint surface roughness is basically measured with a non-contact laser scan profiler or a ccd camera, and then, high quality profiling data can be obtained  on the other hand, the fracture roughness and the aperture distributions of a single rock fracture under certain confining stress conditions have not been evaluated, although it is very important that a measurement system is developed to measure these parameters under confining stress conditions  measuring the joint surface roughness and the aperture distribution is not enough to obtain the height of surface roughness, the contact conditions and the aperture distribution under confining stress conditions | 
2015-487 	 numerical simulation of crack initiation and growth in rock specimens containing a flaw under uniaxial compression |abstract  a vast number of experimental and numerical studies have been performed in the literature to understand the fracturing process in brittle rocks under uniaxial compression; several types of cracks including tensile, shear, and combined tensile-shear have also been observed at the tip of pre-existing flaws  in this study, numerical simulations of a single oriented flaw in brittle rock materials in uniaxial compression were carried out using the extended finite element method (xfem) and the displacement discontinuity method (ddm)  the code frock was used for ddm simulations and the abaqus commercial package was used for the xfem simulations  frock uses stress-based criteria in which the crack initiation is a function of the local stress relative to the strength of the material  in xfem analysis, the maximum principal stress (maxps) failure criterion, assuming crack initiation and propagation in the direction perpendicular to the maximum principal stress, was used  the results from numerical simulations and experimental studies were in good agreement when predicting wing (tensile) cracks at the tip of the flaw  the stress intensity factors obtained from frock and xfem were close to the values obtained from the closed-form solutions  however, the numerical simulations only predicted tensile cracks and failed to predict the shear cracks   1  introduction  the understanding of brittle rock failure in uniaxial compression is an important issue in rock engineering and petroleum engineering due to its applications in earthquake physics, rockburst in mining, wellbore stability, hydraulic fracturing, geothermal reservoirs, among others [1]  several studies have addressed the deformation and fracture characteristics of brittle rocks under uniaxial compression, identifying the following main stages in the failure process [2-5]: (1) crack closure occurring during the initial stages when pre-existing microcracks close; (2) linear elastic deformation behavior after microcracks close, (3) crack initiation and stable crack growth, (4) critical energy release, crack propagation, and unstable crack growth, and (5) failure and post-peak stage  crack initiation and growth result in the non-linear deformation behavior of the rock mass; thus, it is critical to study the crack initiation and propagation processes in brittle rock under uniaxial compression | 
2015-488 	 investigation the effect of cyclic loading on fracture propagation in rocks by using computed tomography (ct) techniques |abstract  in brazilian test, applied diametrical compression stress induces indirect tensile stresses normal to the vertical plane crossing through the rock disc and the ultimate failure occurs at the place where the maximum tensile stress is concentrated  the mechanical behaviour of rock with pre-existing cracks under static loading has been studied widely  in this study, the fracturing behaviour of brisbane tuff, under static and cyclic loading has been analysed applying an isrm standard cracked chevron notched brazilian disc (ccnbd) geometry  specifically, x-ray computed tomography (ct) techniques have been used to investigate the fracturing behaviour of rocks under static and cyclic loading  the fracturing behaviour of rocks technically depends on the nature of loading, strength of mineral and text of rocks  laboratory observations demonstrated that there is a distinct difference in fracturing between the static and cyclic loading  it was found that the cyclic loading had an important effect on microfracture propagation through the fracture propagation zone (fpz) p>  1  introduction  rock cutting is a common rock breakage, or excavation mechanism in tunneling, mining, well drilling and road construction projects  understanding of rock brittle failure and propagation of cracks under the applied cutting loads is significant for rock engineers to investigate cuttability, crushing effect and production efficiency in rock fragmentation process  a considerable amount of literature has been published in rock fracture modeling, however, large amounts of the research have been published based on the experimental and mathematical models developed based on the elastic fracture mechanics  the first prediction model was established based on the maximum tensile stress theory by evans [1]  later, roxborough and philips [2] modified evans model for various rocks and found correlation between the rolling forces, disc diameter, edge angle and penetration rate  according to the experimental studying, brittleness index was established as a function of uniaxial compressive and tensile stress [3]  alehossien and hood [4] proposed a linearized dimensional model to predict rock cutting forces based on the linear model  non-linear and multi-linear predictive model were suggested by tiryaki [5]  amongst the different models of cutter tools, drag picks are more efficient as they attack rock in the tension mode and undercut by the lower magnitudes of forces compared to the shearer or compressive cutters  rock cutting and fragmentation is essential for rock breakage process and forming different sizes of fragments, chips and particles during the rock excavation  as most rocks are weaker under tensile loading, applying tensile stress for rock breakage is the premise for new cutters  moreover, rock initial flaws and cracks are locations for stress concentration, and play an important role for further fracturing and damage by coalescence and propagation  in brittle fracture mechanics, stress intensity factor and critical fracture toughness are the most fundamental parameters used for determining fracture propagation, energy release rate, and crack extension driving forces  typical brittle fracture in rock is characterized by compressive or tensile tests, and post-failure behavior can be explained as the brittleness index for rock  however, under cyclic loading, the fatigue life of rock depends upon both frequency and amplitude of the cyclic loading [6-8]  crack tip characteristic parameters are generally governed by the crack tip stress components and displacement functions to determine crack propagation analysis  the critical fracture toughness can be obtained experimentally according to the suggested methods of international society for rock mechanics (isrm) in a different ways that listed and compared in table 1 | 
2015-489 	 the brittleness index in hydraulic fracturing |abstract  we present a new definition of a brittleness index which is used as a criterion for candidate selection of rock intervals for hydraulic fracturing  the new index is a combination of material strength parameters and insitu stresses  it was derived from an analytical model of hydraulic fracturing in weak formations of varying ductility  the model is based on mohr-coulomb dislocations that are placed in the effective centres of the complete slip process that is distributed around the crack tip  the new brittleness index varies between 0 and 1 with the one limit to correspond to brittle propagation and the other limit to a fracture that requires infinite energy release per unit advance  the values between 0 and 1 correspond to fracture propagation of increasing ductility from brittle to small scale and finally to large scale yielding  the results are particularly interesting for predicting the propagation of axial fractures in the horizontal direction and their confinement in the vertical direction    1  introduction  the brittleness index of rocks is often used as a criterion for candidate selection of rock intervals for hydraulic fracturing in shale reservoirs [1]  several definitions for measuring the brittleness of the rocks were proposed based on different mechanical properties of rocks that are derived from the stress-strain curve or from correlations with physical properties [2, 3, 4]  an inherent problem with some proposed definitions, which are based on simple definitions that were not derived from scientific principles but from correlations that are fitted on dynamic measurements, is that they do not follow the expected trend with some varying parameters such as the confining pressure [1]  therefore, in unconventional shale reservoirs it is important to understand how brittleness can be represented and be used for practical applications of hydraulic fracturing  an extended report and comparisons of 9 different definitions of brittleness numbers based on uniaxial, triaxial and brazilian tests on gas shale and overburden analogues were presented in [5] | 
2015-490 	 biological influences in the subsurface: a method to seal fractures and reduce permeability with microbially-induced calcite precipitation |abstract  novel strategies aimed at increasing underground storage security by sealing unwanted leakage pathways near wellbores are currently under development  one such strategy is to engineer the process known as microbially-induced calcite precipitation (micp) to achieve mineral-based sealing of fractures and reduction of permeability  laboratory-based micp research reported herein has demonstrated the ability to effectively reduce permeability in multiple 2 54 cm (1 inch) diameter berea sandstone cores, seal fractures in shale cores, and seal a hydraulically fractured, 74 cm (29 inch) diameter sandstone core  this research involves integration of experimental testing and simulation modeling  in all experiments reported, sporosarcina pasteurii biofilms were established and an injection strategy developed to optimize caco3 precipitation induced via enzymatic urea hydrolysis  permeability reductions of 3-5 orders of magnitude were demonstrated  a field demonstration project successfully sealed a fractured sandstone formation located 341 m (1118 feet) below ground surface with micp using conventional field delivery technology  micp is a developing novel technology with the potential to seal fractures to reduce the risk of leakage from the subsurface    1  introduction  to manage the environmental risk of storing carbon dioxide in geologic formations, unconventional oil & gas resource development and nuclear waste disposal, novel methods are needed to prevent leakage of subsurface fluids to functional overlying drinking water aquifers or the ground surface  one method currently being explored on multiple scales (from laboratory to field) is the use of microbially-induced calcite precipitation (micp) [1-8]  this method utilizes microbes that have the capability to alter the chemical environments in host rock pore spaces  one example is the use of ureolytic microorganisms that produce enzymes to create saturation conditions favorable for promoting micp [9- 11]  micp has been proposed for a number of subsurface engineering applications including preventing gas leakage by sealing fractures to secure geologic storage of co2 or other fluids, improving wellbore integrity, and stabilizing fractured and unstable porous media [3, 6, 12-16] | 
2015-492 	 experimental evaluation of passive-vibration assisted rotary drilling (p-vard) tool to enhance drilling performance |abstract  the passive-vibration assisted rotary drilling (p-vard) technology was developed to enhance the drilling rate of penetration (rop) for using poly-crystalline diamond compact (pdc) drill bits by modulating the rock-bit interactions  a labscale p-vard prototype was tested by drilling rock analogue fine-grained concrete samples with an unconfined compressive strength (ucs) ~50 mpa  results showed that within the operational range of the tool, defined by the range of wob applied during drilling, rop was consistently 50% or more greater as compared to conventional drilling without the p-vard tool, as other drilling conditions being the same  a field-scale p-vard prototype was developed and tested during field trials in september 2014  evaluation of data from the field trials is ongoing; however, representative drilling results for drilling a red shale formation (with mechanical properties similar to the laboratory concrete material) showed similar results with rop increased 50% to 100% when wob was in the operational range of the tool   1  introduction  by studying vibration assisted rotary drilling (vard), the advance drilling laboratories (adl) of memorial university of newfoundland aims to introduce technologies that provide higher penetration rates and greater economic values in the process of drilling  vibrations are mostly considered undesirable in the field of drilling and efforts are done to mitigate them  vibrations are linked to whirl, stick-slip and nonuniform dynamic loading, which cause damage to bits and down-hole equipment  the institute of technical mechanics, ukraine tested devices that work on the principle of cavitation  a two to three times increase in rop was reported [1]  another study was done on an axial oscillation generator tool (agt) and it was found that the agt improves weight transfer to the bit and reduces torque on bit  also it was found that it significantly reduces stick-slip [2]  national oil-well varco down-hole ltd  (nov) developed a small scale vibration test-rig, to simulate stick-slip and study stickslip mitigation methods  axial friction reduction and axial load transfer can be achieved by introducing axial excitations in the oil-well, which results in an improvement in rop and better mechanical specific energy (mse) [3]  heng li et al reported that the combined effect of vibrations and rotation increases the rate of penetration for a coring bit [4]; also rop improvement was reported as a function of amplitude of vibrations  babatunde et al studied the effect of vibration frequency on penetration rates using natural diamond drag bits  here again vard improved the penetration rates [5]  both heng li et al and babatunde et al used a shaker table under the sample as a source of vibrations  to further study the effect of vibrations on drilling performance, a prototype in-line tool (lab scale p-vard tool) was designed and tested  initial results were promising and significant increase in rop using concrete specimens of medium strength was observed | 
2015-493 	 investigation of roughness algorithms applied to jrc profiles for assessment of weathering |abstract  although jrc profiles are commonly used for shear strength assessment of rock joints, they can also serve as a base model for weathering assessment  in this study, jrc profiles were characterized using eight promising roughness algorithms from diverse fields such as geomorphology, rock mechanics and signal processing  roughness indices of digitized jrc profiles were assessed at three different sampling intervals to observe how scale impacts their correlation with jrc  plots of jrc versus roughness indices exhibit one of two general shapes: either a generally (but sometimes monotonically increasing) curve with occasional small peaks at jrc 6-8 and jrc 12-14 or a bimodal shape that peaks consistently at jrc 10-12 and jrc 14-16 followed by a sudden drop in roughness  z2 and mean absolute angle show the highest linearity of the eight algorithms  z2 has been used numerous times to assess jrc profiles but mean absolute angle is a new and promising roughness algorithm  standard deviation (<u+03c3>) and signal energy (es) demonstrate remarkable consistency between sampling intervals but their relative non-linearity with jrc suggests they are insufficient in quantifying roughness  a new jrc relationship, based on z2 and intercept of the log-log plot of z2 versus sampling interval, is presented  1  introduction  roughness and associated shear strength of discontinuities has long been an important aspect of rock engineering  one of the first studies relating normal force and joint roughness to shear behavior was conducted by patton [1]  as this research progressed, joint roughness became an input into rock mass classification systems  all students, practitioners, and researchers in the field of rock mechanics are familiar with the joint roughness coefficient profiles (jrc) developed by barton and choubey [2]  this seminal tool has been instrumental in the development of roughness and shear strength assessment of discontinuities   quantifying roughness using various algorithms to compute roughness indices (ri) is far from a novel idea and has been explored very soon after the publication of the jrc profiles  however, agreement is seldom found in regards to the proper roughness index [3, 4, 5, and 6], discretization methods such as sampling interval selection [4, 7, 8, and 9], and even the statistical nature of the jrc profiles and other rough surfaces [10 and 11], proving that the task can be deceptively complex  as such, the particulars of proper jrc roughness assessment are still being openly discussed | 
2015-496 	 dilatancy of clay shales and its impact on pore pressure evolution and effective stress for different triaxial stress paths |abstract  a series of laboratory tests on back-saturated specimens of opalinus clay was conducted to investigate the pore pressure response during undrained isotropic compression and elastic/inelastic shearing  pore pressure measurements conducted during undrained loading utilizing a standard triaxial stress path suggest that pore pressure changes are primarily controlled by the transversal isotropic elastic behavior at low compressive loads, and the tendency of the clay shale to dilate as the differential stress exceeds the dilatancy threshold  in addition, both, poroelastic properties (i e , skempton’s pore pressure parameter b) and the tendency of the clay shale to dilate depend strongly on the confining stress  the stress path utilized in standard triaxial tests may substantially differ from the stress path associated with drilling or tunneling, and its influence on the effective strength is to date poorly understood  an alternative stress path used in this study, however, does not reveal significant differences with respect to strength or pore pressure evolution during shearing    1  introduction  clay shales are amongst the most difficult rock types in terms of characterizing their effective strength and stiffness properties and modeling their short- and long-term deformation associated with stress perturbation due to drilling or tunneling  due to their often extremely low permeability, the response of clay shales to short-term loading or unloading (e g  tunnel excavation) is essentially undrained and excess pore pressure (positive or negative) may develop with the tendency of the material to contract or dilate   a series of undrained triaxial tests were conducted on opalinus clay samples to determine the pore pressure evolution during the elastic and inelastic behavior  this contribution explores the effect of confining stress on poroelastic properties, the confining stress dependent dilatancy and related pore pressure effect, and the influence of stress path on the pore pressure response | 
2015-497 	 coal mine pillar failure patterns explained through probabilistic analysis |abstract  this paper is based on a monte carlo simulation of a problem where a coal mine is divided into two sections (east and west) by a dyke such that the east section experiences no pillar failures while the west does despite having the same safety factor  this may prompt one to mine the east section at a lower safety factor arguing that the east section must be logically stronger compared to the west section  probabilistic evaluation using monte carlo simulation is useful in clearing such misconceptions  it brings more light to the extent of dismissing (step by step) an argument which would have seemed to be originally reasonable (like in this paper)  the simulation undertaken utilizes observations of road width, mining height and mining depth for both sections  a sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to select the most appropriate formula for solving the problem between the power formula and the linear formula  the linear formula was considered to be the best as it gave the same stability as the power formula but enabling mining to smaller pillar size  this enables stable, safe and sustainable utilization of mineral resources  a detailed analysis of both sections using the linear formula showed that contrary to one’s argument, both sections are over designed with actually the west section, which is failure ridden, being more over designed than the east section  west section failure is attributed to more variability in observations compared to the east section    1  introduction  probability and risk in rock engineering is one of the crucial pieces which make up the rock engineering puzzle  the probabilistic approach enables engineers to evaluate risk and make decisions within reliable confidence limits  probability and risk utilizes statistical observations and powerful assessment tools such as monte carlo simulation (mc), first order second moment solutions and fault tree diagrams in coming up with a solution to an engineering problem  this approach leads to justifiable designs such as slope stability, rock mass characterization, layout of underground excavations and design of support systems among others | 
2015-498 	 microstructure and micromechanics of wellbore cements under compression and thermal loading |abstract  the primary objective of wellbore cement is to provide zonal isolation as a hydraulic barrier and ensure controlled fluid flow from the reservoir to the production facilities  during the lifetime of a well, cement has to cope with variations in stress, temperature and pressure  frequent and dramatic oscillations of stress, temperature and pressure can cause damage within cement and its interfaces as well, which may leads to damage of cement sheath integrity, resulting in loss of zonal isolation and sustained casing pressure  this study investigated the effect of the mechanical compression and cyclic temperature variations on the mechanical properties of the cement, such as hardness and young’s modulus; furthermore, this study included evaluation of cement slurries typically used in the deep drilling in the gulf of mexico us for cement compression   micro indentation tests were conducted on cement samples to evaluate the changes in mechanical properties with various cement designs  analysis of indentation results on the cement samples showed: (a) a decrease in hardness and young’s modulus right after compression while an overall increase one month after compression; (b) cyclic temperature variations significantly decreased neat cement hardness and young’s modulus, but this effect varied when cement had other chemical additives; (c) hardness and young’s modulus decreased after increasing water to cement ratio  based on these results we are further investigating how to optimize cement slurries for field application that are characterized by thermal oscillation and under confined compression of cement sheath    1  introduction  1 1 wellbore cementthe main engineered hydraulic barrier in wellbores, cement sheath, can be subjected to many types of failures during the well life  the primary functions of wellbore cements are to provide zonal isolation, mechanical support of the metal pipe and prevent corrosion of metal component of wellbore system  failures in cement sheaths can lead to the contamination of fresh water aquifer, migration of reservoir fluids from high pressure sands to low pressure sands, and sustained casing pressure as a result of fluid migration from the reservoir to the surface [1, 2]  the integrity of the wellbore cement sheath is a function of the mechanical properties of the hydrated cement, the geometry of the cased well and the properties of the surrounding formation [3]  during cementing operations, insufficient mud removal and improper cement placement might lead to weak bonding on both interfaces of the cement sheath  [4, 5]  debonding may be caused by casing movement, pressure and/or temperature changes, and cement shrinkage  pressure and temperature oscillations caused by completion and production operations contribute to the development of fractures and microannuli within the cement matrix [6]  cement fractures created due to internal pressurization of the casing generally cause loss of annular zonal isolation in the lower quarter to third of the well, while large temperature changes cause cement sheath fracturing in the upper third to half of the well [7]   both tensile and shear failures of the cement sheath have been shown to have a strong relationship with wellbore pressure and temperature [8]  | 
2015-501 	 a review of pillar design for platinum mining to enhance stability: a zimbabwean case study |abstract  any bord and pillar platinum mine thrives on effective design of bords and pillars  pillars have to be large enough to ensure safety and small enough to ensure economic and sustainable exploitation of the mineral resource  consideration of span of the bords of the working area is also crucial to safe and economic design of the mining layout  this research makes a critical review of the current design approach so as to understand the contributors to pillar failure in a section of an underground platinum bord and pillar mine  the research focuses on the areas that have been plagued by bad ground and seeks to determine the suitability of the current design in such conditions with an objective to redesign the section so as to curb the consequences of pillar failure in the operation  at the core of this research is the detailed geotechnical data of the area that was studied  making use of rock mass classification (rmc) and other rock engineering techniques, the review indicates that the adopted design is not suitable for the ground conditions evaluated, thus confirming the problem’s origin  the safety factor analysis shows that the ground conditions in the area of study would pose a greater risk due to failure of pillars  the conditions, predominantly the closer joint spacing made the rock mass deteriorate in strength and quality thus the pillar size needed to be increased so as to maintain the required strength  this shows that the pillars in the study area are at a higher risk of failure hence motivating for the redesign process  this paper details the proposed redesign which, if implemented, is expected to see a reduced extraction ratio but will enhance stability and facilitate optimum mining operations   1  introduction  accurate pillar design and stability analysis are crucial to safe mining in a bord and pillar layout  this paper makes a critical review of the current bords and pillar design and layout at a platinum mine in zimbabwe which has been affected by ground failure  the mine is located on the great dyke of zimbabwe and exploits an orebody which is not deeper than 500m below surface for platinum group elements (pges)  while pges are the main minerals of interest and extraction at the mine, copper, nickel and gold are also recovered from the operation  the mine is located in a block delineated by two faults in a fairly stable region  regionally, the geology at the mine is similar and consistent with the rest of the great dyke  locally, the orebody lies at the bottom of the main sequence of sulphide bearing rocks and is about 1 2m above a footwall fault (fwf) that occurs consistently throughout the mining environment  the fault infill material is known to negatively affect the metallurgical process through which the ore is taken to recover pges  due to the clayey nature of its infill material, the fault presents a high risk on regional support (pillars) especially where it coincides with the footwall of mining excavations and can be subjected to water flows | 
2015-502 	 observations of acoustic emissions in a hydraulically loaded granite specimen |abstract |hydraulic fracturing has become increasingly prevalent in the oil and gas industry as well as in enhanced geothermal systems as a method to increase the permeability of rock masses  however, the process is still not very well understood in terms of the fracture mechanisms that occur as cracks initiate, propagate and coalesce  laboratory tests can be useful in this regard as they provide insights into fracture behaviour during hydraulic loading under controlled conditions  this paper describes the development of an acoustic emissions setup capable of capturing a stream of data over approximately five seconds corresponding to crack initiation and propagation  |the ae setup was used in a series of hydraulic fracturing experiments on granite specimens  it was found that for one particular specimen, few emissions were observed until the applied water pressure reached 90% of the failure pressure  after this point it was observed that low energy emissions were produced at a constant rate until approximately 0 1s before failure, whereupon a series of higher energy emissions occur  these higher energy emissions were compared to high speed video taken at 15 000 fps, and it was observed that significant local white patching (microcracking) occurred in this time period  finally, crack initiation appears to be related to the onset of a high amplitude emission with a duration of 0 3s, as observed using high speed video  |1  introduction |it is a well-known phenomenon that the rate of acoustic emissions increases close to the time at which shear failure occurs [1]  this is particularly true in brittle materials, where the rate of emissions often exceeds that which can be handled by the acquisition system [2], [3]  |ae systems have traditionally had issues recording data at the time of a fracturing event due to hit based architecture, where the system acquires data in discrete segments and requires time to re-arm after every hit  it is possible to circumvent this problem by use of a continuous waveform recorder [4], however in such an approach the data only span a limited time window due to memory limitations  consequently, any longer experiment would require a separate hit based acquisition system to acquire data in the early phase of the experiment  the main disadvantages of such a setup is that splitting the sensor signal into two acquisition systems increases the electronic noise in all voltage readings, the continuous data can often consume significant memory space, and analysis can become more difficult due to sheer volume of data  as a result, it would be ideal to develop a single acquisition system with both hit-based and continuous modes of operation | 
2015-503 	 use of rock mass classification in prefeasibility studies: an illustrative study |abstract  this paper is based on a prefeasibility project requiring initial estimates of support needed to stabilize excavations made in a rock mass  it is a typical engineering scoping study which sought for the necessary information on which a reliable decision on whether to proceed with the project or not could be made  the paper features the assessment of stability and support requirements of a combination of a metro tunnel, metro station and ventilation raisebore excavations  bieniawski’s rock mass excavability index (rme) was utilized to determine the advance rate expected for the raisebored tunnel  principles of rock mass classification are utilized in the project  rock mass classification (rmc) plays a pivotal role in the design of excavations in both civil and mining engineering  it is a quick and an uncomplicated powerful tool to assess stability of excavations as well as the support requirements of the same  rock mass deformation properties can also be determined using rmc systems  while it is so easy to use them, one needs to have the requisite technical skills to comprehend the theory underlying each classification system together with its limitations  this approach in using rock mass classification systems minimize abuse and ensures maximum benefit from them  the author also briefly discussed some of the ways to address serious concerns about rmc systems   1  introduction  the mining engineering fraternity strives to achieve safe, fast and economic extraction of mineral resources  rock mass classification is one of the powerful tools to this end  while rock mass classification (rmc) techniques like rock mass excavability (rme) index, q system, geological strength index (gsi), terzaghi’s rock load approach, bieniawski’s rmr system, laubscher’s mrmr system, potvin stability graph method, barton’s qtbm, mark and molinda’s coal mine roof rating (cmrr) and the rock wall condition factor among others have gained wide spread use, they must be used with great care and caution if users are to get workable solutions from them  rmc systems are like a pencil handled in an artist’s hand calling for greater skill and experience in order to leave an artful impression  one needs to beware of the limitations of each system and its areas of applicability before attempting to use it  it must be noted that rmc systems have to work hand in glove with laborious engineering design in order to come up with a workable solution  rmc systems should complement more sophisticated and detailed design procedures [1]  in the goal to realise workable solutions in engineering including classification of rocks, [2] point out that technical skills are among major strategic issues to be considered  like other approaches there is risk associated with making rmc approaches part of our designs  this risk has to make part of our decision criterion as advised by [3]  this way, rmc systems become reliable, fast, easy and much less complicated means of addressing design needs | 
2015-504 	 rate dependence of dry, oil- or water-saturated chalk |abstract  the rate dependence of dry, oil- or water-saturated high-porosity outcrop chalk is investigated based on whether the fluid effect could be excluded from a governing material parameter, the b-factor  the b-factor is used in geotechnical engineering to establish the difference in evolution of load between stress-strain curves when applying different loading rates  the material investigated is outcrop chalk from stevns, southern part of denmark, with a porosity of 43 to 44% and subjected to varying loading rates  the biot critical frequency is a function of the fluid properties viscosity and density, and the material properties porosity and permeability  the critical frequency is interpreted as a measure of the solid-fluid friction and hence relevant to use for subtracting the fluid effect to arrive at a pure material parameter  the results show a correlation between the b-factor and the biot critical frequency   1  introduction  for hydrocarbon reservoir behavior upscaling from laboratory results to field behavior is important  one of the central parameters which are challenging to apply in the laboratory is the low strain or stress rate involved  these can range from as much as 1 %/hour for the laboratory tests to 10–4%/hour for a hydrocarbon reservoir under depletion [1]  thus upscaling parameters measured in the laboratory is important  the time dependence is vital as it affects both the strength and the deformation such that a slow loading results in a weaker material response and a faster loading rate yields a higher strength and a stiffer response  dealing with the time effect is exemplified by rhett [2] for the ekofisk field, and by de waal and smits [3] for goose creek, wilmington, inglewood, nigata, boliva coast, and groningen fields | 
2015-507 	 modeling the interaction between hydraulic and natural fractures using dual-lattice discrete element method |abstract  the interaction between hydraulic fractures (hf) and natural fractures (nf) will lead to complex fracture networks due to the branching and merging of natural and hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs  in this paper, a newly developed hydraulic fracturing simulator based on discrete element method is used to predict the generation of complex fracture network in the presence of pre-existing natural fractures  by coupling geomechanics and reservoir flow within a dual lattice system, this simulator can effectively capture the poro-elastic effects and fluid leakoff into the formation  when hfs are intercepting single or multiple nfs, complex mechanisms such as direct crossing, arresting, dilating and branching can be simulated  based on the model, the effects of injected fluid rate, viscosity, nf orientation, nf permeability, nf cohesion and stress anisotropy on the hf-nf interaction process are investigated  combined impacts from multiple parameters are also examined in the paper  the numerical results show that large values of stress anisotropy, intercepting angle, injection rate and viscosity will impede the opening of nfs   1  introduction  according to the microseismic observations, hydraulic induced fractures in shale reservoir often deviate from the conventional bi-wing fracture geometry and lead to complex fracture network, which may be caused by stress shadow effect from multiple hydraulic fractures (hfs) or interaction with pre-existing natural fractures (nfs)  it has been demonstrated that the widespread presence of natural fractures in most shale formation will significantly impact the induced fracture pattern  understanding the interaction between hf and nf plays a crucial role in quantifying the stimulated reservoir volume (srv) and optimizing the well completion strategy    as shown in figure 1, there are several possibilities that might occur when hydraulic fractures intersect with natural fractures[1,2]:   (1) the hydraulic fracture directly crosses the natural fracture and keeps propagating with its original direction;   (2) the hydraulic fracture crosses the natural fracture with an offset, where hydraulic fracture will deflect into the natural fracture for a certain distance and resume its propagation along the maximum stress direction at some weak points of natural fracture;| 
2015-510 	 numerical simulation of end constraint effect on post-peak behaviors of rocks in uniaxial compression |abstract  in uniaxial compression the end constraint has a large influence on the geometry effect of rocks  however, the relationship between the end constraint and the geometry effect and their combined effects on the post-peak behavior of rocks are poorly understood  in the present study, a numerical experiment of rock specimens with different geometries in 3d uniaxial compression was carried out  specimen geometry (slenderness and shape) and contact properties (loading stiffness and friction) were considered in the simulation  it is found that in the absence of the end constraint, the post-peak behavior of rocks depends on the specimen slenderness, implying that the slenderness effect can be an intrinsic geometry effect of mohr-coulomb material such as rocks  next, it is shown that the end constraint enhances the post-peak strength of rocks by inducing confined zones in the specimen, and the size of the confined zones increases as the specimen slenderness decreases  furthermore, it is observed that it is the slenderness rather than the cross sectional shape of a rock specimen that is closely related to the end constraint; therefore, the slenderness dominates the geometry effect of rocks in laboratory test results  finally, it is confirmed that there is a critical value of h/w ratio where the specimen is least affected by the end constraint    1  introduction  obtaining complete stress-strain curves of rocks is important for rock strength characterization in laboratory and pillar design in deep underground mines [1]  end constraint is initiated under compression at specimen-platen contacts in rock laboratory tests due to the elastic mismatch between the rock specimen and the steel loading platen [2, 3]  although different testing apparatus and approaches have been employed to minimize the influence of the end constraint on rock property testing [4-6], it is practically impossible to exclude the end constraint from rock tests [7]  therefore, it is important to study the influence of end constraint on the post-peak behavior of rocks in compression   end constraint at the specimen-platen contacts mainly consists of two aspects: loading machine stiffness along the normal direction of the contact and friction across the surface of the contact  in most previous studies on the investigation of the friction effect on peak strength of rocks, a plane stress condition was usually assumed, which is inconsistent with the boundary condition in laboratory tests [7-10]  furthermore, the effects of loading machine stiffness and friction on the post-peak behavior of rocks were not considered together [11]  hence, the relationship between the end constraint and the geometry effect and their combined effect on the post-peak behavior of rocks are poorly understood  therefore, a three dimensional (3d) model that can realistically consider the stiffness and friction properties of the specimen-platen contact is needed to better capture the post-peak behavior of rocks in compression | 
2015-511 	 development of an oedometer cell to study the horizontal stress evolution during a chemical dissolution |abstract  the purpose of this paper is to investigate the horizontal stress evolution and soil collapse during the cement dissolution process using a combination of experimental and numerical methods  the experimental procedure was carried out using a modified oedometer cell with horizontal stress measurements and synthetic samples in order to simulate simultaneous cement dissolution, stress changes and sample deformation  the samples were loaded at a constant vertical stress and exposed to a reactive fluid which dissolved the cementation of the artificial soil  during the dissolution process, sample volume decreased and horizontal stress changes were observed  initially the horizontal stress decreased due to grain mass loss and then increased due to solid matrix rearrangement  numerical simulation of these coupled chemical and mechanical processes was performed using a general purpose finite element code capable of performing numerical analysis of engineering problems  the constitutive model adopted to reproduce the sample behavior is an extension of the barcelona basic model for unsaturated soils including the cement mineral concentration as state variable  some new features were incorporated to the original elasto-plastic model in order to represent the results observed in the experiments  encouraging agreement has been found concerning the validation of the proposed formulation    1  introduction|some geotechnical problems that are likely to require new approaches or, at least, extension of the classical ones are as follows: collapse and expansion of active soils, subsidence due to oil and gas extraction, dissolution, degradation and weathering of soils and rocks and co2 sequestration [1]  for instance, the large-scale injection of co2<sub> and other gases into geological formations may induce complex interaction of multiphase flow, diffusion, convection, mineral and gas dissolution, mineral precipitation, and other chemical reactions  depending on the composition of the rock and fluids and co2 injection strategy, the rock-fluid interactions may have a significant impact on safety and reservoir storage capacity [2]  | 
2015-513 	 finite element analysis of casing-in-casing integrity due to annulus pressurization by means of salt creep |abstract  casing integrity is a major concern in wells drilled through salt zones due to the salt time-dependent behaviour  as wellbore closes, the trapped annular experience a pressure build-up that may subject casing to high loads, leading to its collapse  in this scenario, a big concern of the well design engineers is to predict whether or not the string will fail, and the consequences to the integrity of the production casing, which can lead to serious problems and possibly making any workover infeasible  therefore this paper focus in the contribution of salt creep to the annular pressure build up (apb) phenomenon, and the consequences of wellbore closure in the integrity of both intermediary and production casings  the analyses involve fem simulations of different case scenarios with considerations of fluid elements, which can account for fluid compressibility, i e , pressure build-up as the wellbore closes and pressure relief as the casing collapses   1  introduction  many reservoirs can be found beneath salt formations  this occurrence is favorable because of salt extremely low porosity and low permeability, which makes it a excellent sealing rock  in through-salt environments, well integrity in long-term production is a great concern due to rock creep  for deep wells, where high temperature and high pressure are expected, a proper casing design has to be carefully analyzed so as to guarantee a safe operation until well abandonment   when crossing salt formations, intermediary casing has an extremely important role, as it must protect production casing from salt-related problems  to assure production casing integrity, a series of studies have to be conducted so as to determine whether the casing configuration will withstand different types of loads over time  one of these studies is the analysis of the pressurization on the annulus above top of cement, which can lead to casing system collapse due to trapped drilling mud | 
2015-514 	 on the importance and impact of key geomechanical parameters in unconventional play developments |abstract  while numerous definitions of what makes unconventional plays ‘unconventional’ have been put forth, ranging from the reliance on horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing technology to the often ultra-low permeability of the matrix, a key characteristic of unconventionals is the impact of geomechanics on hydraulic fracturing in reservoir formations with natural fractures and/or weakness planes (e g , bedding planes)  critical geomechanics effects include the influence of: 1) all three principal stress magnitudes; 2) anisotropy in the stress magnitudes; 3) the orientation of the stress field; 4) in-situ pressure (e g , pressure within the natural fractures and weakness planes); 5) natural fracture and weakness plane frequency and connectivity; 6) natural fracture and weakness plane orientation relative to the stress field; 7) natural fracture and weakness plane mechanical properties (elastic properties such as stiffness as well as strength properties such as cohesion and friction coefficient); 8) natural fracture and weakness plane initial aperture; and 9) the interaction with operational parameters during a hydraulic fracture stimulation (e g , rate, volume, and viscosity)  in this paper, the authors review the importance and impact of these critical geomechanical parameters on hydraulic fracturing design and effectiveness in unconventionals    1  introduction  numerous definitions of what makes unconventional plays ‘unconventional’ have been put forth ranging from the reliance on horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing technology to the often ultra-low permeability of the matrix (as low as single-digit nanodarcy)  however, an important key to unconventionals is the impact of geomechanics on hydraulic fracturing in reservoir formations with natural fractures and/or weakness planes (e g , bedding planes), which has often made hydraulic fracture design and implementation both challenging and inconsistent in unconventionals   while commercial hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for more than 65 years [1], hydraulic fracture design has been based upon the assumption that equal half-length, bi-planar fractures will develop since a dominant control on fracture length is fracture height growth, which itself is dominantly controlled by the vertical profile of the minimum in-situ principal stress, shmin [2]  this assumption is often valid because hydraulic fractures are created using hydraulic energy, which acts omni-directionally, ensuring that hydraulic fracture propagation always follows the path of least resistance, which itself is often dominated by a laterally-uniform stress field  | 
2015-517 	 gas flow measurements of consolidating crushed salt |abstract  crushed salt is being considered as a backfill material in the event of a salt repository for high level nuclear waste  the thermal-mechanical-hydrological properties of crushed salt as it reconsolidates in response to pressure and temperature changes are therefore important  an experimental system to measure gas flow through consolidating crushed salt at elevated temperature and pressure has been developed and tested  an experiment completed at 250°c, and hydrostatic pressures to 20 mpa, compacted a crushed salt sample from ~40 percent porosity to near zero porosity  for this consolidation history, apparent permeability decreased from greater than 10-12 m2 to ~10-22 m2    1  introduction  it is important to improve the understanding of the coupled thermal-mechanical-hydrologic response of granular (or crushed) salt used as a seal material for shafts, drifts, and boreholes in mined salt repositories  granular salt consolidation is being investigated through an integrated program of laboratory measurements, observations, and constitutive model development and evaluation  in particular, we are focused on measuring the deformation and corresponding permeability reduction of granular salt as it consolidates to fractional densities greater than 0 90  behavior at high fractional densities is of principal importance to repository applications because this is when the permeability of granular salt is expected to decrease to a condition comparable to intact salt, that is, it becomes nearly impermeable  an extension of an existing constitutive model is being developed using these data to allow prediction of changing properties as granular salt consolidates   rock salt has been considered as a potential disposal medium, because salt is essentially impermeable  the very existence of salt millions of years after deposition is proof that water has not flowed through the formation  the undisturbed formation permeability of salt is essentially too low to measure using traditional hydrologic and reservoir engineering methods  in undisturbed and healed salt, brine is not able to flow at rates that would lead to significant radionuclide mobilization and transport  in terms of disposal, one of the most important features of salt as an isolation medium is its ability to heal previously damaged areas  damage recovery is often referred to as “healing” of fractures  the healing mechanisms include microfracture closure and bonding of fracture surfaces  evidence for healing of fractures in salt has been obtained in laboratory experiments and through observations of natural analogs  fracture healing can restore the low permeability of intact rock salt  the consolidation of granular rock salt is envisioned to occur under similar mechanisms to healing | 
2015-518 	 a new prediction model of energy consumption on rock fragmentation and rate of penetration based on fractal theory |abstract  one of the major challenges during drilling in hard-brittle formation in tarim basin is to evaluate the rock drillability and to predict the rate of penetration (rop) accurately  the aim of this article is to analyze the drilling resistance of rock breaking and to predict the rop from a new angle  in this paper, the fractal characteristic of rock fragmentation and the problem of rock energy consumption in drilling process are studied based on the fractal theory through rock-breaking laboratory experiment by roller cone bit and rock cuttings screening experiment  a new prediction model of energy consumption on rock fragmentation is proposed based on size distribution of rock cuttings, fractal dimensions, and energy dissipation analysis  also, the prediction equation of rop is given based on the principle of energy conservation  the biggest advantage of this model is that the energy consumption on rock fragmentation and the rop can be predicted entirely based on rock cuttings, fractal dimensions and drilling parameters  according to field data analysis, the consistency, is encouraging, with an average error below 15%    1  introduction  in drilling process, to make an accurate evaluation of rock drillability is an important basis for optimizing drilling parameters and determining drilling measures  currently, many investigators have evaluated the rock drillability and predicted the rop mainly from the perspective of rock drillability test indoor or drilling rate equation [3-6]  however, these methods are not only costly but also takes a long time; the rop predictions are complicated and infeasible in field application   fractal geometry was originally developed by mandelbrot to describe the highly irregular and self-similar objects, and then the fractal theory was applied to many other science fields [1, 8, 9]  in the field of rock comminution, numerous studies show that rock fragmentation has fractal characteristic; the fractal characteristic of cuttings reflects the rock crushing mechanism and energy dissipation process [2, 7, 8, 9]  in this paper, the size distribution of cuttings and drilling parameters are combined based on fractal geometry to develop a fractal model for energy dissipation of rock crushing  this model can be applied to determine the required minimum energy for rock breaking  meanwhile, according to the principle of energy conservation, we can use this model to predict drilling speed  therefore, the establishment of this model provides a new method for optimizing drilling parameters and improving drilling efficiency | 
2015-520 	 numerical simulation study on injection for enhancing hydrocarbon recovery and co2 sequestration in tight oil formations |abstract  single digit percentage of oil shale recovery leaves a large room for recovery improvement, while aqueous phase injection into shale formation is extremely challenging  injecting carbon dioxide (co2) into oil shale formations can potentially improve oil recovery  furthermore, the large surface area in the organic rich shale could permanently store co2 volume without jeopardizing the formation integrity  this work is a study on evaluating the effectiveness of co2 enhanced oil shale recovery and shale formation co2 sequestration capacity  a compositional reservoir simulator is used to model co2 injection  petrophysical and fluid properties similar to the bakken formation are used to set up the base model for simulation  the reservoir model considered petrophysical characteristics of shale formation that affects co2 flow migration like in-situ stress changes, reservoir heterogeneity, and natural fractures  the results are based on sensitivity analysis of the characteristic shale petrophysical and geomechanical properties  sensitivity analysis method analyzed all uncertain parameters together using the design of experiment and response surface modeling approach to counter the interaction between parameters and influential parameters into generating a proxy model for optimizing oil recovery and co2 injection into the formation  the above studies are implemented with and without geomechanical module and results are analyzed  the results show that facilitating oil recovery from shale reservoirs by co2 injection is much higher than primary depletion depending on fracture network connectivity and geomechanical impact  also, significant co2 storage capacity if applicable in shale formations, will be a major step towards advances in co2 sequestration in widely spread shale reservoirs    1  introduction  unconventional reservoir is a term to describe a hydrocarbon resource that could not be technically or economically recoverable without stimulation  reservoir quality of tight formations is categorized as very poor because the ultra-low permeability restricts fluid movement within the reservoir  this leads to single digit oil recovery factors and costly development activities  commercial development of low permeability, ultra-tight formations by advances in horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing techniques have led to the production of significant amount of hydrocarbons  a typical production profile of an unconventional tight oil formation is illustrated in figure 1  the high initial production rates usually attribute to hydraulic fractures, and then oil rate declines steeply once the oil near the fractured zone is produced  beyond this rate, the flow is mainly controlled by inter-porosity mass transfer between the matrix and fracture network  in literature we studied, enhanced oil recovery (eor) for unconventional oil reservoirs are limited  | 
2015-521 	 the effect of rock mineralogic and petrographic properties on stone cutting feed rate |abstract  the feed rate of the natural building stone cutting processes is determined by the properties of the natural stone and the machine being used  the most significant factors that affect the feed rate during natural building stone cutting processes are the mineralogic and petrographic properties of the natural stone  the feed rate is determined by the operator, and is generally selected based on the operator’s own experience  regardless of the type of stone being cut, the main goal of natural building stone cutting processes is to achieve an optimum feed rate, while also ensuring minimal power expenditure and tool wear  in this study, the cutting data for nine different natural building stone cutting processes classified under three different groups were investigated  the mineralogic and petrographic properties were determined for the natural stones being cut, and the effects of rock mineralogy on the optimum feed rate was evaluated based on the comparison of feed rates with these properties  in this context, the cutting processes of building stones consisting of marble, limestone, and travertine were evaluated  according to the study data, factors that played an important role in the selection of feed rate under industrial cutting conditions include the mineral structure of the rock, the mineral grain size, the porous structure of the rock, rock hardness, and the layer structure  natural building stone cutting processes can generally be classified into three groups as low-speed, medium-speed, and high-speed cutting conditions  in each one of these groups, the cutting speeds are directly affected by the mineralogic and petrographic properties of the rock   1  introduction  the process of cutting dimensioned products from natural stone blocks requires the use of circular saw blades with very different diameters and characteristics  to ensure efficiency of production, it is important not only to select a saw blade that is suitable for the type of stone being cut, but also to operate the saw blade under suitable working parameters, in that the cutting of natural stone does not generally take place under ideal conditions [1]  one of the most important factors affecting the efficiency of natural stone cutting with circular saws is the feed rate  in addition to this, the life and performance of the saw are also affected by a number of different factors, the most important of these being the diamond and matrix properties (hardness of the metal bond formulation, grit size, diamond concentration and diamond type); the method used for manufacturing the segment; the applicable sawing conditions (cutting depth, cutting speed and feed rate); and the mineralogical and physico-mechanical properties of the stone being cut [2]  to ensure cutting under ideal conditions, it is necessary to carry out a detailed evaluation of all cutting conditions | 
2015-522 	 influence of indexation and impact energy on bit/rock interface law in percussive drilling: an experimental study |abstract  this paper presents the results of a laboratory study aimed at assessing the influence of indexation (the ratio of the bit angular velocity over the activation frequency) and impact energy on the performance of percussive drilling  a block of kuru grey granite is subjected to sequential impacts with a o33mm seven-button drill bit driven by a drop machine  the force versus displacement curve is obtained through a strain gauge located on the impacting tup and the volume of removed rock is captured by taking a rubber specimen of the drilling bottom-hole, cleaned by air-flushing, after each impact  these two measurements enable to investigate the link between the penetration of the bit after each impact and the average rate of penetration of the bit after multiple impacts  understanding and quantifying the dependence of these relationships on indexation and impact energy will lead to the formulation of more realistic bit/rock interface laws that implicitly account for repeated impacts of the bit on the rock   1  introduction|down-the-hole (dth) percussive drilling is a widely used technology to complete boreholes in hard rock formations  this technology consists in applying repetitive impacts on a continuously rotating drill bit (lindqvist, 1984; hustrulid and fairhurst, 1971)  at each impact, compressive waves travel the drill bit down to the rock material, which enable the bit penetration by indentation of the drill bit buttons into the rock material  crushing of the rock occurs right under the indenter and consumes most of the energy provided to the drill bit (saksala et al , 2014)  however, most of the material removal is achieved by the formation of larger rock fragments from lateral cracks  indeed, this so called chipping process creates craters that are larger than the bit button marks i e  rock is fragmented and removed under and between the buttons (lindqvist and lai, 1983)  this process requires (i) a minimum amount of impact energy (saksala et al , 2014) and (ii) a rotation of the drill bit between each impact  this work is motivated by the recognition that despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies (hustrulid and fairhust, 1971; lundberg, 1973a, 1973b; kou et al , 1995), the dependence of the penetration rate on indexation and impact energy remains poorly understood  a subsidiary issue that we address is the link between the penetration of the bit after each impact and the average penetration rate of the bit after multiple impacts: due to the chipping of the rock, the observed rate of penetration (rop) obtained during percussive drilling (pd) is larger than what could have been inferred from the penetration obtained with a single impact test made in laboratory  this relationship between the bit rop and the button penetration depends on the indexation between two percussive activations and presumably also on the impact energy  understanding the relations between average bit rop and single impact bit penetration, and quantifying the dependence of these relationships on indexation and impact energy will lead to the formulation of more realistic bit/rock interface (bri) laws that implicitly account for repeated impacts of the bit on the rock  realistic bri laws are critical for modeling the dynamical response of dth percussive drilling systems (depouhon, 2014; depouhon et al , 2014) | 
2015-530 	 finite element modeling of curving hydraulic fractures and near-wellbore hydraulic fracture complexity |abstract  an outstanding question in the design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment is how fractures, which often initiate in non-ideal orientations under the influence of near-field stress concentrations, propagate outwards and turn towards their ideal orientations under the far-field stress conditions  using a fully coupled 2d/3d finite element hydraulic fracturing model in geos, we simulate fracture initiation and propagation for three distinct cases  first, we consider the growth of a simple bowl shaped fracture near a free surface  the numerical results are compared against recently published experimental results and are used to calibrate the model response  second, we consider the growth of an infinitely long axial fracture from a vertical wellbore for a range of stress states, fracture orientations, and fluid characteristics  finally, we consider the case where a discrete axial fracture from a horizontal wellbore propagates outward and transitions to a transverse fracture   1  introduction  in this paper, we consider the mechanisms that govern the initiation and growth of hydraulic fractures from an uncased horizontal wellbore  this is a challenging problem because the solution extends over a wide range of scales in solid and fluid dynamics  at the onset of the problem, the fluid in the wellbore is slowly pressurized until the resulting tensile hoop stress triggers the growth of an axial fracture in the surrounding rock  shortly after initiation, the stored energy in the wellbore drives rapid axial fracture growth in the near-wellbore stress regime and the fluid flow is dominated by viscous forces  as the fracture increases in height, its rate of growth slows and it begins to encounter the far-field stress regime, which may favor azimuthal fracture propagation  at some distance, the fracture will tend to curve towards its new ideal orientation, or simply open a new branch in the azimuthal direction  finally, the fracture will enter a more regular stage of azimuthal growth that is controlled by the pumping rate, fluid viscosity and/or rock toughness   the behavior of this type of hydraulic fracture is well understood at very early times, where it effectively is a half-penny shaped fracture propagating in the near-wellbore stress regime, and at very late times, where it is approximated by a pkn or penny shaped fracture propagating in the far-field stress regime [1, 2, 3]  however, at intermediate times, there is very little experimental or theoretical work available to describe its behavior | 
2015-532 	 long-term creep experiments on haynesville shale rocks |abstract  shale rocks with high clay and carbonate content show time-dependent deformation at different conditions of stress  in this paper, we present a series of time-cycling triaxial deformation creep tests conducted on two samples from the haynesville formation in east texas  a power-law model was fit to all creep measurements to find the constitutive parameters of the time-dependent deformation of these samples  we obtained these constitutive parameters from triaxial creep experiments over time periods of 3-4 hours, one day, one week and 3-4 weeks  although further experiments are needed, the experimental results obtained to date show that short-term creep tests are able to provide constitutive parameters that predict long-term deformation of these clay-rich shales  both young’s modulus and the viscoelastic properties are anisotropic, with the samples being more compliant and more viscoplastic when deformed normal to bedding   1  introduction  understanding time-dependent deformation in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs is one of the most difficult technical problems in the oil and gas industry  viscous deformation can change both mechanical and fluid flow properties of shales, which are of primary importance in determining production capacity of shale gas reservoirs  clay minerals may be significantly responsible for the inelastic deformation of shale rocks because of their high viscoelastic behavior [1, 2, 3, 4]   several techniques have been used to determine the inelastic time-dependent deformation of rocks, among which uniaxial and triaxial creep experiments have been used widely [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]  the main problem with conducting these experiments is that time dependent essences of creep experiments make these tests costly and time consuming  consequently, predicting the longterm inelastic deformation of rocks from short-time experiments has been a matter of interest to the scholars    in this study, we performed a series of conventional triaxial creep experiments on two clay-rich samples from the haynesville shale formation to investigate the inelastic deformation process in shales  the triaxial experiments were performed in a time-cycling pattern on a horizontal and a vertical shale sample to understand the bedding orientation effects  this time-cycling pattern includes a series of multi-stage loading/unloading experiments at different time spans  the main goal of performing this type of experiment was to study the authenticity of the few-hours long creep experiments | 
2015-534 	 application of programmatic gridding technique to advanced reservoir geomechanics modeling |abstract  reservoir geomechanics as a reckoned role incorporates with not only performances of reservoir flows but its leakage-proof security  in order to take near and far-field geomechanics into account during modelling co2 injection process into deep saline aquifer, it is studied how to sufficiently control a compatible numerical discretization between reservoir flow and reservoir geomechanics  application of gridding technique is implemented through source code programming  it is introduced self-developed realization in commercial software package from unstructured meshes for the sake of efficiently extending overlying strata up to ground surface, to a regularly refined focus capable of stepwise capturing co2 plume, surrounding by circumference divided into cells gradually scaling up along radiant directions  the resultant distributions of ground surface deformation simulated using different gridding algorithms are compared and some principles counter-intuitive to a usual work flow in analyzing ground surface heave induced by deep gas injection are studied  in addition, as a foundation to facilitate the decoupling strategy, an tractable interface is programmed to provide completely identical models as well as their discretization between reservoir flow simulation software cmg’s gem and reservoir geomechanics modelling package itasca’s flac-3d    1  introduction  geomechanics is playing a significant role in assessing the leakage-proof security related near-field integrity and far-field manifestation, along with subsurface volume perturbation induced by pressure transients from its reservoir initial state to distribution driven by injected flows, particularly, e g , in case of geological sequestration of carbon dioxide into deep saline aquifer [1]  among the geomechanical responses to gas injection, an obvious mechanics is the inflation of reservoir  it is well known that effective stress acting on porous rocks can be simplified as the difference of total stress applied by regional tectonic stress and overburden weight subtracting the pore pressure [2], which means any increase in pore pressure caused by injection will reduce the effective stress acting on porous rocks [3], hence leading to reservoir inflation  in many cases, this change in depth transfers all the way and can reach the surface being manifested as extremely slight ground heave or sag  though ground surface deformation falls into hardly detectable magnitudes, geodetic methods, such as tiltmeter array, interferometric synthetic aperture radae (in sar), gps surveying [4] as well as certain combination of these approaches, are usually feasible to monitor and reflect the reservoir pressure growth caused by co2 plume spreading at reservoir depth | 
2015-535 	 dem simulation of fracture process of inherently anisotropic rock under brazilian test condition |abstract  fracture process of inherently anisotropic rock discs under brazilian test conditions are investigated with the use of two-dimensional discrete element methods (dem)  in the dem model, the rock matrix is represented as an assembly of rigid particles bonded at their contacts and the presence of intrinsic anisotropy is explicitly modeled by imposing individual smooth joint contacts into the bonded-particle model  a series of anisotropic models with different angles between weak layers and loading direction are tested (<u+03b8>=0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°)  the anisotropic numerical model is firstly calibrated to match the variation of brazilian tensile strength with anisotropy angles of anisotropic rocks from published experimental data [1]  good agreement can be found between the failure patterns of numerical model and those observed in laboratory  after that, the fracture process of anisotropic rock under diametrical compression is investigated in detail by exploring the occurrence, development and coalescence of micro cracks with different anisotropy angles  micromechanical studies are also conducted by examining the modes, increment and distribution of micro cracks at different stages in order to gain insights on the failure mechanisms of anisotropic rocks under indirect tensile test conditions with different anisotropy angles   1  introduction  among the many mechanical parameters, the tensile strength of rock material is a key one because rocks are in nature much weaker in tension than in compression  many rock mechanics applications like the propagation of hydraulic fractures, rate of rock blasting, and drilling of boreholes in sedimentary rocks are highly dependent on the tensile strength of surrounding rocks [2, 3]  the brazilian tensile test [4] (diametrical compression of circular discs) has been widely adopted in laboratory to determine the tensile strength of rock materials    in laboratory, a series of experimental studies have been performed on different rocks with anisotropic properties in order to understand the responses of them under indirect tensile stress [5-8]  in fact, there is no consistent trend for the variation of brazilian tensile strength (bts) with the anisotropy angle due to the complex stress distribution between the weak layers and rock matrix  based on results from nine types of rocks, vervoort et al  [1] proposed four different trends for the bts and failure patterns of anisotropic rocks under the brazilain test conditions: trend1, the bts stays constant over the entire anisotropy angles; trend 2, the bts stays constant between 0° and 45°, followed by a linear decrease; trend 3, the bts systematically decrease over the entire interval; trend 4: the bts decreases from very low anisotropy angles (between 0° and 30°) and followed by a leveling off  they provided some explanations based on the relative lengths of fractures observed along the weak planes and in the matrix  however, the micromechanics for these different trends are still not fully understood  in addition, the failure patterns of anisotropic rocks are found more complex than those of isotropic rocks  | 
2015-536 	 parametric study of smooth joint parameters on the behavior of inherently anisotropic rock under uniaxial compression condition |abstract  inherently anisotropic rocks are modeled with the use of two-dimensional discrete element methods (dem)  in the simulated anisotropic rock sample, the rock matrix is modeled as an assembly of rigid particles and the existence of weak layers is directly represented by imposing individual smooth joint (sj) contacts with same orientation into the rock matrix  the properties of a sj contact include normal and shear stiffness, normal strength, cohesion, and friction angle  a systematic study is conducted to investigate the influence of these parameters on the macro behaviors of anisotropic rocks with different anisotropy angles under uniaxial compression condition  the young’s modulus is found to increase significantly with the sj normal stiffness when the anisotropy angle is low (0°-30°)  the usc increases with the sj normal strength at high anisotropy angle (<u+03b2>>60°) while cohesion raises the ucs at medium anisotropy angle (30°-60°)  the influence of friction angle is not significant  understanding the influence of each parameter is of great importance for the calibration of micro parameters to represent certain type of rock  a general process for the calibration of micro parameters to reproduce the strength and deformation behaviors of different types of anisotropic rocks is proposed    1  introduction|anisotropy is everywhere while isotropy is rare [1]  many rocks are characterized by a structural inherent anisotropy which is due to the existence of rock fabric elements such as bedding, layering, foliation and lamination planes [2]  such rocks are said to be inherently anisotropic as their physical, mechanical and hydraulic properties vary with direction  rock anisotropy affects many rock related projects, e g , borehole stability [3], propagation of hydraulic fracturing [2], and deviation of drilling  therefore, a complete understanding of the behaviors of anisotropic rocks under different stress conditions is extremely important |in the past several decades, many investigators have performed compression tests on various anisotropic rocks, e g , niandou et al  [4] on shale, nasseri et al [5] on schists, tien et al  [6] on artificial materials  in general, the variation of failure strength with the anisotropy angle is characterized by a u-shaped curve with the minimum strength obtained when the anisotropy angle (<u+03b2>) is around 60°  in fact, the geometry of the curves as well as the failure modes with different anisotropy angles vary for different types of rocks [4]  attempts have also been made aiming to investigate the effect of weak planes orientation on the behaviors of anisotropic rocks on the micro-scale through laboratory testing [7, 8]  however, it is very difficult to explore the micro-scale mechanisms from laboratory testing which leads to a lack of a thorough understanding of the underlying failure mechanisms  | 
2015-537 	 reducing the uncertainty in tight rock porosity estimation by combining different methods-bakken formation case |abstract  in recent years, petroleum exploration and production from the bakken formation in williston basin have gained great momentum and pushed the oil production to over one million barrels per day  estimation of original oil and gas in place and recoverable hydrocarbons of the bakken formation requires an accurate estimation of porosity  unfortunately, uncertainty in porosity measurements in tight rocks such as bakken could be as high as +/-1 0 porosity unit if a single method is applied  this is significant considering that most bakken sample porosity is less than 8%  in this study, we measured the porosity of tight rocks utilizing four different methods: gas expansion method, radius-of-investigation method, pressure buildup method, and oscillating pulse method  in this way, porosity of over 200 bakken core samples have been measured in this study  the uncertainty in the porosity measurement is reduced by applying proper experiment procedures and cross-checking by different approaches  the comparability of results from different methods increased  experience and lessons learned from this study can be a good guideline to the accurate measurement of other tight rock porosity  therefore, a more accurate evaluation of hydrocarbons in place is possible and the primary production design and enhanced oil recovery method selection can be more appropriate  furthermore, difference among the results is useful for indicating the heterogeneity and/or microcracks of the rock, which are crucial in drilling and completing unconventional oil and gas wells   1  introduction  during the last decade, petroleum exploration and production from the bakken formation in williston basin have gained great momentum and pushed the oil production to over one million barrels per day  however, producing hydrocarbons from the bakken formation is challenging due to its low porosity and permeability  the high uncertainty in the estimation of original oil and gas in place and recoverable hydrocarbons of the bakken formation is reflected by the wide range estimated by many researchers  in addition, porosity is one of the key parameters in modeling fluids flow in reservoir matrices  unfortunately, uncertainty in porosity measurements in tight rocks such as bakken could be as high as +/- 1 0 porosity unit if a single method is applied  this is significant considering that most bakken sample porosity is less than 8%  an accurate estimation of bakken rock porosity is important to successfully produce from bakken reservoir | 
2015-538 	 analytical model of accelerating gas flow-induced conductivity damage in propped hydraulic fractures |abstract  hydraulic fracturing is carried out to create a conductive fracture in tight reservoirs to provide an easier path for fluids to flow to the wellbore  the actual performance of fractured wells is often turned down due to the loss of fracture conductivity  the inertial effects such as forchheimer drag and acceleration are believed to the major sources for this  this paper presents an analytical method to model the accelerating flow effect on the production performance of hydraulically fractured wells by modifying the fracture conductivity  the method is suitable to conveniently incorporate the accelerating flow effect in a production prediction model usually used for fracture treatment design and optimization  the method is then used to demonstrate that the accelerating effect is the only one source for the minimum of fracture conductivity, one of the major sources for the loss of fracture conductivity, and account for the source for discrepancy between the predicted and actual productivities    1  introduction|hydraulic fracturing is carried out to create a conductive fracture in tight reservoirs to provide an easier path for fluids to flow to the wellbore  the flow rate that can be achieved by hydraulic fracturing has a strong relationship of fracture treatment is usually optimized to be productive as well as cost-effective  a flow rate prediction model is usually used in the design process  the promising aspect of such an integrated fracture design optimization approach is demonstrated by rahman et al [1]  however, the actual performance of fractured wells is often turned down due to the loss of fracture conductivity  the non-darcy flow effect is believed to be one of the major sources for this  the general mathematical form of the darcy’s law that is used for fluid flow modeling through a porous medium can be expressed as follows:| 
2015-539 	 effect of fracture heterogeneities on reactive flow |abstract  the interdependent effects of mechanical stresses and fluid-rock reactions govern the evolution of fracture permeability  yet, the ability to predict whether the coupled chemical and mechanical processes will enhance or diminish the permeability of heterogeneous fractures remains elusive  in this paper, we present a modeling framework based on a previously developed model that calculates the combined effect of reactive-flow and geomechanical deformation on a heterogeneous fracture  we use synthetic aperture fields with varied micro-scale roughness and correlation length to investigate the effect of geometrical heterogeneities on the evolution of fracture apertures due to reactive flow  an increase in fracture fluctuations amplitude enhances the development of channels in the fracture and can shift the dissolution regime from advection-dominated to reaction-dominated  whereas an increase in correlation length reduces the number of channels while enhancing their widths  anticipating such differences in permeability evolution is important in engineering application involving fluid-rock interactions, such as acid stimulation, for effective and efficient reservoir permeability enhancement    1  introduction  fractures often control transport properties in rock formations  quantifying fracture permeability is crucial for the long-term isolation in geologic formations of (i) injected greenhouse gases (co2) for climate change mitigation [1, 2], (ii) waste fluids for underground disposal [3], and (iii) nuclear waste for secure storage [4, 5]  the successful isolation of these fluids within rock formations requires robust predictions of fracture permeabilities, particularly in caprock formations relied upon to provide structural seals [6, 7]  also, quantifying fracture permeability is important for the production of fluids through enhanced hydrocarbons extraction [6] and geothermal systems [8, 9] for energy purposes    the combined effects of fluid-rock reactions and mechanical stresses govern the evolution of permeability and porosity of reservoir and seal systems subjected to reactive fluids (e g  [9-12])  three processes govern the evolution of fracture porosity and permeability during reactive flow: (i) fluid flow through the fracture aperture for a given pressure drop or flow rate, (ii) concomitant evolution of the aperture and fluid composition due to chemical mass transfer across the fluid-rock interface, and (iii) aperture evolution due to mechanical stresses applied on the fracture surfaces  while normal compressive stresses deform the fracture and decrease its permeability, reactive fluid-flow can both increase and decrease fracture permeability by means of mineral dissolution and precipitation, respectively  moreover, the combined effect of mechanical deformation and reactive flow on permeability can be dramatically different from the effect of mechanical deformation and reactive flow separately [13-15]  tuning the flow rate or the reaction rate can result in the onset of reaction instabilities at certain length scales [16, 17]  here we show how the onset of reaction instabilities is influenced by fracture heterogeneities characterized by the correlation length and fluctuation amplitude of the aperture  in the following sections, we present our model, use the model to confirm previously reported results on the effect of reactive flow and mechanical deformation on fracture aperture evolution, and investigate the influence of geometrical heterogeneities of the fracture aperture on the evolution of fracture permeability | 
2015-540 	 decimeter-scale analysis of geologic heterogeneity in a brittle-ductile shear zone, aspoohard rock laboratory, sweden |abstract  during a previous solute transport study (true block scale) at the aspo hard rock laboratory in oskarshamn, sweden, an extensive characterization of a 100m scale rock volume was undertaken with an emphasis on fracture and deformation zone geometry and connectivity  the construction of a new experimental tunnel (tass) adjacent to the true block allowed the opportunity for the detailed characterization of one of the key hydraulic conductors, a brittle-ductile shear zone named structure #20  utilizing high-resolution hdr and uv digital images alongside hydraulic interference analysis, borehole core and image log analysis, tunnel wall mapping and mineralogical analysis of fracture fillings, this study focused on understanding the geometric, mineralogical, structural and hydraulic heterogeneity of structure #20 at a scale (centimeter to decimeter) important to radionuclide transport understanding  the result was a greater understanding of the in-plane variability of an important class of structural features in rock types typical for proposed high-level spent nuclear fuel repositories in the nordic countries   1  the aspo hard rock laboratory  the aspo hard rock laboratory (hrl) is a key element in the research and design of geological spent nuclear fuel repositories in sweden  seated approximately 450 m beneath the island of aspo off the eastern coast of sweden near the city of oskarshamn, construction of the aspo hrl began in 1990 and ended in 1995, though the excavation of new experimental niches and tunnels continues [1]  the geology of aspo hrl is dominated by granitoids of the trans-scandinavian igneous belt, but also includes fine-grained granite dikes and sheets, mafic inclusions and xenoliths [2]  the age (1 85 ga), mineralogy and chemistry of the rocks at aspo are similar to those at the candidate sites (forsmark, laxemar and olkiluoto) for spent nuclear fuel repositories elsewhere in the nordic countries   aspo is run by the swedish nuclear fuel and waste management company (skb), an organization tasked with the disposal and safety of the legacy of sweden’s nuclear power program  aspo hrl is used for the development of systems and processes for safe long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel using the kbs-3 concept  | 
2015-541 	 stress path of coal seams during depletion: the effect of desorption on coal failure |abstract  unmineable coal seams constitute important domestic sources of natural gas in several countries  although limited in size, coal seams have the advantage of being naturally fractured, which facilitates drainage upon depletion  reservoir depletion changes the state of stresses in the reservoir  the change of stress is suggested by order-of-magnitude increases of permeability upon depletion and observation of significant fines production in some mature wells, this latter phenomenon known as "coal failure"  desorption-induced shrinkage of coal appears to cause changes of stress in the formation in addition to those of porepressure reduction during depletion  we summarize laboratory data replicating the stress path of coal seams far from the wellbore considering no change of horizontal strain and constant total vertical stress  experimental results show that desorption-induced shrinkage promotes significant lateral stress relaxation sometimes leading to shear failure  desorption amplifies the effect of pore pressure reduction and makes shear fracture reactivation more likely to happen than in non-sorbing rocks  this study shows the importance of considering depletion in coal seams as a chemo-geomechanical coupled process and the importance of rock failure in bulk reservoir permeability    1  introduction  it has been long known that depletion of water- and hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs can change the state of stresses in the subsurface  changes in stress can affect both the reservoir and surrounding formations [1-2]  pore pressure reduction associated with depletion commonly causes an increase of effective stress in the reservoir rock such that the reservoir rock suffers a process of compaction  this change of stresses in the reservoir is usually anisotropic  effective vertical stress is expected to increase more rapidly than horizontal vertical stress in horizontally extensive reservoirs  such anisotropic changes in stress can cause shear failure in the reservoir rock  these changes are commonly measured as a reduction of total horizontal stress as documented in fields in the north sea and the gulf of mexico [3-5]  significant changes of effective stresses upon depletion are also expected in the vicinity of the wellbore and perforations  localized failure in these areas coupled with high flow rates leads to production of fines, a phenomenon known as sand production [6-7]   coal seams are naturally fractured gas reservoirs [8-9]  they are usually laterally extensive with modest net thickness  for example, the net thickness of the fruitland formation in san juan basin varies from less than 1 m to ~20m [10]  | 
2015-542 	 effect of fracture dilation angle on stress-dependent permeability tensor of fractured rock |abstract  fluid flow in fractured rock is controlled by flow paths in a network of discrete pre-existing fractures  the same can be said for fracture networks induced by loading or unloading  in both cases, or in the combined case, the determination or evolving modification of an equivalent permeability tensor is necessary for up-scaling the equivalent continuum hydro-mechanical properties of a fractured rock  the evolution of fracture aperture during shearing and the associated dilation process control the permeability of single fractures and fracture networks  in order to understand this process, a number of rotated discrete fracture networks is generated with different mean fracture orientations  permeability tensors are calculated, from distinct element hydro-mechanically coupled models, when initial fracture apertures are correlated with fracture trace length in 2d models at different stress ratios  a non-linear behavior between normal stress-normal displacements of fractures is adopted so that both scale and stress-dependent normal stiffness of the fractures can be considered  the results show that overall permeability continued to decrease, with the increase of stress ratio, when zero dilation is assigned to the fractures  however, when the dilation mechanism of the fractures is modeled, equivalent permeability decreases with increasing stress magnitudes when stress ratio is not large enough to initiate shear dilation processes in a fracture  in this case, normal closure of the fractures is the dominating mechanism for decreasing the overall permeability of models  when stress ratios increased up to k=3 or higher, most of the fractures will experience shear dilation with increasing overall flow rates of models  flow rate distribution at different stress ratios show that a small number of large fractures with large initial aperture values remains conductive in all stress conditions and control the permeability and flow pattern of the models significantly  with increasing stress ratios, it becomes more and more difficult to establish an equivalent permeability tensor, compared with the non-stressed model  for models with non-zero values of fracture dilation angle, the existence of permeability tensor is not affected by changing in the magnitude of dilation angle when small stress ratio is applied  however, when stress ratio increases up to k=3 or higher, the values of dilation angles lead to additional contributions from shear dilations of fractures which become the main reason for increasing of permeability, compared to the models with lower dilation angle  | 
2015-543 	 some open issues on the design of protection barriers against rockfall |abstract  uncertainties in rock and soil engineering are connected with the cognitive boundaries and with the natural variability of the relevant variables  in particular, uncertainties are linked to geometrical and mechanical aspects and the model used for the problem schematization  while nothing can be done to remove the randomness of natural variables, except defining their variability boundaries with stochastic studies, the uncertainties due to the cognitive gaps could be filled by improving the quality of measuring instruments and numerical codes  the present paper considers uncertainties connected to the design of protection barriers against rockfall and contains a simple application of interval analysis to the problem, in order to quantify spacing influence on predicting rock block volume  a case study is also presented: block volume calculated from interval analysis is compared to results obtained from a non-contact survey and validated with in situ measurements  also kinetic energy calculation is performed in order to show block volume influence on the design of a protection barrier   1  introduction   the design of a geotechnical structure has inevitably to include the identification and the evaluation of a series of uncertainties due to the characteristics, the complexity and the non-homogeneous nature of the involved medium, either soil or rock  if the design concerns slope stability problems, the amount of uncertainties is further complicated  in fact, not only the time factor has to be considered as an additional variable, but also the spatial dimensions of the potentially involved areas  therefore, for a better design in the rock engineering field, it is necessary to focus the attention on the involved uncertainties [1]  the nature of the uncertainties in rock engineering is extensively discussed in literature  in [2], for example, sources of errors in sampling are classified as:  • sampling error; • estimation (“statistical”) error; • measurement error  | 
2015-546 	 application of refraction microtremor (remi) for predicting changes in rock characterization in an underground gold mine in nevada  |abstract  underground mines commonly use drill core rigs to anticipate future ground conditions  these drill core rigs can be highly expensive and can easily miss changes in rock characterization, depending on the amount of drilling taking place  in an attempt to provide a more efficient means of determining changes in rock characterization, a study was conducted using the refraction microtremor (remi) process in an underground mine  remi involves acquiring noise data along a linear array of geophones  data is processed to obtain shear-wave velocities underneath the array  the data for our study was collected at an underground gold mine in nevada, and was analyzed using the seisopt® remi™ (© optim, 2015)  the data was collected using horizontal and vertical geophones, placed into the ribs of the drift in a horizontal plane, rather than the industry standard placement of vertical geophones into the ground in a vertical plane  in order to determine whether the changes seen actually exist, shear wave velocities were measured in location of known rock characterization  these shear wave velocities were then compared with the rock mass rating (rmr) and previously published correlations between rmr and shear wave velocity  this comparison yielded results that did not match the published correlation between rmr and shear wave velocity  it is likely that the stresses surrounding the excavation affected the shear wave velocity values recorded; however, it is difficult to quantify these affects due to minimal research regarding in-situ stresses in the area  in addition, the use of remi as a tool to determine the extent of voids underground was investigated  this can then be used to determine the extent of voids underground and help to distinguish locations where voids may be near above or below excavations  the recordings showed that a void existed, however, did not show the entire extents of the void  this is because the geophone array was not long enough to cover the full length of the void  in order to determine if the remi process can effectively be employed to detect voids into the rib, further research is suggested  | 
2015-547 	 study of geomechanical properties of 3d printed sandstone analogue |abstract  the validation of numerical models of geomechanical processes relies on physical testing of these processes in a laboratory setting  however, due to their heterogeneous nature, test specimens of natural materials often show a wide range of geomechanical properties  in the last decade, major advances have been made in the quality and commercial availability of 3d printers  at present, 3d printing has been used in the fabrication of medical implants and prosthetics, prototyping of mechanical designs and even in the construction of complete buildings  this paper presents 3d printing as an opportunity to control many of the variables that are inherent to the study of geo-materials  by using a 3d sand printer to fabricate test specimens, we were able to produce multiple, exact replicas of specimens with a high level of control on the nature of the heterogeneities and the properties of the matrix  preliminary test results are presented from uniaxial compression tests and optical microscopy evaluation of introduced flaws  by knowing and controlling inter-sample variability in terms of porosity, fracture networks, grain size distribution, density distribution, etcetera, 3d printing of geomaterials provides a valuable tool to validate numerical models, develop scaling laws and constitutive relationships, quantify the degree of influence from pore geometry, fracture network characteristics and structural heterogeneity on macroscopic properties such as bulk modulus and effective permeability   1  introduction  in the last several decades, numerical models of geomechanical processes have become a highly sophisticated and powerful tool to study the behavior of rock from a micro-scale to a basin-scale [1, 2]  these numerical models are heavily reliant on physical testing of natural rock samples for calibration and validation purposes  however, due to their heterogeneous nature, test specimens of natural materials often show a wide range of geomechanical properties [3]  this poses a significant obstacle for both calibration and validation of the numerical models    the rapid development of the additive manufacturing (3d printing) industry in recent years has resulted in the commercial availability of a wide range of 3d printer models [4, 5, 6, 7]  although the vast majority of 3d printers produce plastic parts [4, 5, 6], there are 3d printing techniques that allow the printing of metals [7], ceramics [8] and sand [9]  |although the possibilities of 3d printing have been recognized in the rock mechanics world [10, 11, 12], plastic has been the prevalent material of choice  to the authors’ knowledge, the ability to print granular materials such as sand has not yet been utilized in the rock mechanics scientific community  | 
2015-549 	 acoustic emission monitoring elucidates proppant pack strength characteristics during crush testing |abstract  enhancing formation permeability through hydraulic fracturing has become a common tool for oil and gas, as well as enhanced geothermal systems reservoir production  nanodarcy permeability is common in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs requiring the production to greatly depend on the complex network of induced and natural fractures  proppant is used in these complex fracture networks to keep conductive pathways open and connected to the wellbore for flowback after fracture closure  the quality and mechanical properties of proppant directly impact the conductivity of the fracture network  numerous proppant and proppant pack characterization tests can be performed to understand the behavior of the proppant pack in a fracture, some of which were initially outlined in api rp-56/58/60 and later in iso 13503-2  according to iso 13503-2 section 11, proppant pack crush strength is determined based on the amount of fines generated at specific loading conditions  although this method gives an idea of proppant pack failure in a stress range, numerous tests are required to deconvolve the actual pack strength but still do not provide any information regarding partial pack yielding and precise full pack crush strength providing only wide application strength limits for a group of proppants  to study this problem, numerous proppant crush tests were performed according to this standard with the inclusion of acoustic emission (ae) monitoring  two ae piezoelectric transducers were placed on the crush cell to observe sound waves stemming from grain friction as well as particle fracture initiation  the observed ae rate throughout the test showed stress level at pack grain alignment as well as the initiation of particle fracture, or proppant pack yield  testing was performed on 20/40 mesh white sand, manmade proppant, resin pre-coated proppant, as well as other saturated and unsaturated conditions, including surface-modification agent (sma) coatings  information gained from ae analysis was compared to post-test particle size distribution  as a simple, non-invasive technique, ae monitoring proved to be a valuable and effective tool in evaluating proppant pack yield and strength performance at downhole conditions, allowing the well operator to select the optimal proppant material used in the hydraulic fracturing treatments for his well | 
2015-550 	 modeling dynamic stimulation of geologic resources |abstract  dynamic loading methods promise new modes for stimulating geological resources  in contrast to traditional fracturing methods (e g  hydraulic fracturing) the stresses in the source region may be significantly larger than the in situ stress which helps creating fractures not oriented with the maximum in situ stress  this paper discusses simulation of dynamic fracture initiation and propagation using lawrence livermore’s geodyn-e and geodyn-l codes  these are massively-parallel multi-material codes developed for shock wave propagation in heavily jointed rock masses  the codes have been validated by modeling various underground explosions  here, we focus on various mechanisms of dynamic fracture generation in a rock formation with pre-existing joints/cracks  various source geometries and energy release rates are considered to optimize the enhancement of the fracture network, which could be stimulated later using traditional methods    1  introduction  large-scale deployment of long lateral wells supporting the initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures has led to a surge in production from unconventional resources in north america  however, one limitation of such fracturing operations is that the induced fractures tend to be aligned with the maximum in-situ stress direction, which is not necessarily the optimal direction required to create the most permeable fracture network  here, we investigate possible advantages of emerging technologies using explosives to dynamically fracture deeply buried shale formations as well as provide flexibility and control to design more efficient fracture networks and enhance permeability in tight formations at depths of a few kilometers  in this approach we rely on the ability of stress waves from an explosive charge to overcome the in-situ stresses and create fractures in many directions, in contrast to one stress-aligned fracture formed during hydraulic fracturing  additional approaches are presented to create enhanced fracture networks by using multiple explosive charges, varying their geometries, and optimizing their initiation times  the massively parallel codes, geodyn-l and geodyn-e used in the current studies have been validated for underground explosions in rocks [1] | 
2015-552 	 calibration of inelastic constitutive behaviour at a late stage mine and the challenges associated with data limited calibration |abstract  a geomechanics study was conducted to examine the seismic risks associated with late stage mining at a case study mine in canada  recent large scale pillar extractions and increasing seismicity at the site identified the need to consider seismic risk as the mine extends deeper and sill pillars are thinned and removed  due to a lack of available quantitative data, a 3d fdm model was developed and the rock mass strength and behaviour was qualitatively calibrated to various geotechnical data sources  with the installation of a mine-wide seismic array, as well as measures of "depth of damage" during drilling and observed damage recorded throughout the mine during several field visits, sufficient data was accumulated to qualitatively calibrate a plastic model of the mine  the challenges in implementing a mine-wide inelastic model calibration with data acquired late in mine life are discussed    1  introduction  numerical methods are utilized in geomechanical engineering to improve understanding of physical processes, to determine stress or strain at specific instances in space or time and to predict rock mass response to excavation, construction or support  some of the key advantages of numerical methods in mine design include the timely prediction of rock mechanics processes for the duration of a mining project, experimentation with design and construction options (e g  stand-off distances and sequencing strategies), and performance of sensitivity analyses  numerical analyses also allow engineers to gain a qualitative understanding of the complex geomechanical system through quantitative evaluation  the largest challenges faced in numerical modelling of geomechanical problems originate from lack of complete knowledge of the true rock mass properties, fracture networks, stress conditions and groundwater influences for the entire region of interest (i e  project site)  rock masses are discontinuous, anisotropic, inhomogeneous, and for inelastic mine-scale simulations; the determination of material properties or in situ stress conditions is typically difficult over the full extent of a region being modelled  | 
2015-553 	 borehole breakout analysis to determine the in-situ stress state in hard rock |abstract  assumed stress states can have significant implications to the feasibility of mining projects, as stope design, strategic sequencing and permanent infrastructure siting are major controls on development costs and production rates, and henceforth life of mine economics  the stress state used for numerical modelling purposes is typically a global assumption for the entire mining area of interest, when in fact the actual magnitude and orientation of the stress tensor may vary by localized geological controls  this paper provides a discussion on how to minimize uncertainty imn pre-mining stress state assumptions by utilizing analytical and numerical methods to back-calculate far field stresses from observations of borehole breakout  a case history is presented examining breakout observed in acoustic televiewer data in a deep shaft pilot hole at kghm international’s victoria project in sudbury, ontario, canada  in addition to the use of conventional analytical methods, the available data are analyzed based on a series of two-dimensional numerical models  ultimately, a stress model is developed to demonstrate the proposed analysis methodology  the proposed model shows the local variability in stress magnitudes across different lithologies while generally agreeing with a regional stress model from the literature   1  introduction  when designing excavations at depth, the stress model used in empirical, analytical, and numerical tools plays a significant role in the outcomes of analyses  in the field of mining geomechanics, the stress state can have significant implications for the feasibility of projects, as major controls on life of mine economics such as stope design, excavation sequencing, and permanent infrastructure siting are all dependent on predicted stress re-distribution patterns |the most recent isrm suggested method for rock stress estimation provides a strategy for stress model development which integrates geology and tectonic setting, stress indicators, stress measurements, and numerical modelling into a final model [1]  one of the preliminary stress estimation techniques recommended by stephansson & zang [1] is the analysis of borehole breakout data  borehole breakout data provides a convenient way to estimate the in-situ stress tensor, as all the necessary information can be obtained simply by logging existing boreholes using a device such as an acoustic televiewer (atv) | 
2015-554 	 numerical investigation of the relationship between fracture shear compliance and conductivity anisotropy |abstract  measurement of the shear to normal compliance ratio is one of the few remote sensing techniques available for estimating the in situ properties of fractures  we present an accurate yet efficient method for predicting the normal and shear compliance of fractures using an asperity-based approach  the resultant capabilities provide an efficient, versatile tool for predicting the normal and shear compliance of fractures with arbitrary roughness under a given level of closure stress  we apply the method to the prediction of evolving shear compliance under closure stress  we also calculate the corresponding anisotropic conductivity of the deformed fractures and find that the direction of highest shear compliance correlates well with the direction of highest fracture conductivity  this suggests that the degree of shear compliance anisotropy may be an indicator of conductivity anisotropy in natural fractures over a range of stresses    1  introduction  seismic and acoustic measurements are the most readily available methods for inferring the mechanical properties of fractures and faults in the field  as a consequence, many authors have sought to develop approaches that can relate the geometric properties of a fracture to its seismic or acoustic signature  in particular, the ratio of shear compliance to the normal compliance has been pursued as an indicator of the microstructure within a fracture or as an indicator of fluid content [1]  kachanov et al  [2] studied the similarities and difference between treating fractures as surfaces with discrete points of contact versus traction-free cracks  they found that although the resulting formulas for the fracture compliances have similar form, the microstructural parameters controlling the magnitude of the results were different  sayers et al  [3] pointed out that such approximations obtain very different results because fundamentally distinct assumptions are made regarding the way the fracture surface interact  sayers et al  [3] concluded that such discrepancies can be avoided if more realistic geometries and deformation models are utilized for the asperities or cemententation within the fracture  sayers et al  [3] went on to demonstrate that 2-d finite element calculation can address asperity deformation directly and provide more reliable insight into the shear and normal compliance of fractures  in theory, more representative results could be inferred through the use of 3-d finite elements, however, it is currently impractical to use such an approach for large fractures or within extensive parameter studies | 
2015-556 	 comparison of injection-induced fault reactivation and seismicity in co2 sequestration and shale-gas fracturing |abstract  in this paper we summarize and compare numerical simulation results of injection-induced fault reactivation and seismicity associated with underground co2 injection and hydraulic fracturing of shale-gas reservoirs  overall, the analysis shows that while the co2 geologic sequestration in deep sedimentary formations are capable of producing notable events (e g  magnitude 3 or 4); the likelihood for such felt events is much smaller in the case of shale-gas fracturing  the reason is that co2 geological sequestration involves injection and pressure disturbances at much larger scale and duration than in the case of shale-gas fracturing  in the case of shale-gas fracturing, the expected low permeability of faults intersecting gas-saturated shales is clearly a limiting factor for the possible rupture length and seismic magnitude  for a fault that is initially impermeable, the only possibility of larger fault slip events would be opening by hydraulic fracturing allowing pressure to permeate along the fault causing a reduction in the frictional strength over a sufficiently large fault surface patch and very brittle fault properties that would allow sudden (seismic) shear slip to develop over a sufficient large rupture area  in both co2 sequestration and shale-gas fracturing, the brittleness of the rock is an important factor, which is a site-specific factor and it should be considered when assessing the likelihood of felt seismicity    1  introduction  the potential for fault reactivation and induced seismicity are issues of concern related to both geologic co2 sequestration and shale-gas fracturing [1-7]  it is well known that underground injection may cause induced seismicity depending on site-specific conditions, such as stress and rock properties and injection parameters  in the case of shale-gas fracturing, only three cases of felt seismicity have been documented out of hundreds of thousands of hydraulic fracturing stimulation stages performed to-date [5]  so far no sizeable seismic event that could be felt by humans on the ground surface has been documented associated with co2 sequestration activities [2, 7]  however, at future industrial scale projects for co2 sequestration, a much larger rates and volumes than current pilot scale projects would be required to mitigate the global emission of greenhouse gases  | 
2015-557 	 newly developed centrifuge testing program of sagd caprock integrity |abstract  steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) is one of two commercial in situ recovery technologies (the other is cyclic steam stimulation, css) being deployed for bitumen recovery within the vast oilsands reserves in northern alberta, canada  however, to ensure the safe operation of sagd, caprock integrity has to be maintained  in the past, most of the research efforts have been devoted to reservoir geomechanical simulation studies of sagd caprock integrity  physical modeling studies are conducted to a lesser extent  this paper describes a newly developed testing program of sagd caprock integrity using the 50g-ton beam centrifuge, the first of its kind in western canada, at geotechnical centrifuge experimental research facility (geocerf) at university of alberta  initial studies have utilized over-consolidated speswhite kaolin block samples to mimic the caprock in centrifuge models instead of using in-situ caprock material for the purpose of eliminating the influences of property variability  at 100g centrifuge spinning, a 20cm thick test material can simulate a caprock formation of 20m, while stress profile in the centrifuge model is still similar to that in the prototype  in order to fail the caprock at 100g, a custom-designed electromechanical device named geomechanical caprock deflection mechanism (geocdm) is successfully manufactured and commissioned  image-based displacement measurement technique of particle image velocimetry (piv) is employed to measure the soil deformation    1  introduction  steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) is a widely used thermal recovery process for extracting bitumen from the oilsands reservoirs in northern alberta  because of the continuous injection of high pressure and high temperature steam into the oilsands reservoir, the stress and strain fields in the reservoir and its surrounding formations are significantly altered, which may lead to the failure of the caprock overlying the reservoir  the 2006 joslyn steam release incident has been a bitter lesson learnt from losing the caprock integrity [1]  since then, tremendous efforts have been devoted to reservoir geomechanical simulation studies of sagd caprock integrity  physical modeling studies have been conducted to a lesser extent, as it is difficult to carry out physical modeling of prototypes at such a scale as sagd projects  | 
2015-558 	 simulation of simultaneous and zipper fractures in shale formations |abstract  horizontal well hydraulic fracturing can help develop unconventional petroleum resources using techniques such as simultaneous and sequential fracturing  to achieve successful and desired stimulated rock volumes and fracture networks, it is beneficial to understand the effect of fracture spacing and various rock and fluid properties on stimulation to minimize the risk of unwanted fracture geometries  this paper investigates the effectiveness of fracturing techniques using a fully coupled 2d plane strain numerical model based on displacement discontinuity method [1]  the multi-stage fracturing model considers different boundary conditions for the previous stage fractures, such as constant pressure restricting the flow back between stages and proppant-filled  a series of examples are presented to demonstrate the effect of fracture spacing on resulting fracture system geometry and stimulated rock volume  the model is also used to compare the conventional zipper fracturing technique (i e  fracturing multiple parallel horizontal wells sequentially) with modified zipper fracturing technique  the results highlight the fracture apertures and geometries to achieve optimization of fracturing process  the paper also discusses the effects of rock anisotropic characteristics of shale on the fracturing results   1  introduction  increased interest in exploration and production of lower grade reservoirs presents new challenges in design and evaluation of hydraulic stimulation treatment of horizontal wells  each treatment stage in a well is designed to stimulate a reservoir volume to create a desired permeability enhancement  the collective stimulated zones should affect the maximum volume with minimal overlap of adjacent treatment stages  usually, fracturing treatment of horizontal wells is carried out using one of two schemes namely, simul- frac and sequel-frac  in simultaneous fracturing multiple fractures are created and propagated at same time whereas in sequential fracturing, fractures are created one after another usually by keeping the previously created fracture/fractures either propped or pressurized with fluid  zipper fracturing is a technique where two or more lateral horizontal wells (usually at the same depth) are fractured simultaneously or sequentially [2]  the main purpose of zipper fracturing is to create close fractures and maximize stimulation effect, thus improving the stimulated rock volume  in all cases, the perforation clusters should be placed such that competing stress-shadow effects between them is minimized  by reducing the number of clusters per stage, costs are reduced and stress interference is minimized, reducing the possibility of having ineffective fracturing  | 
2015-564 	 a new method for assessment of rock drillability based on indentation tests |abstract  accurate assessment of rock drillability is crucial in improving the rate of penetration and drilling efficiency in drilling process  in this paper, experimental research on rock indentation fragmentation by single-indenter at varying confining pressures has been carried out  moreover, measuring tool of three-dimensional digital microscope has been applied to observe and analyze the shape and volume of crushing craters  a new breakability index (bi) of rock considering the impact of both invasion difficulty of tool and characteristic of rock brittleness is defined from force-penetration curve of indentation test  the relationship of both specific energy (se) and volume of crater (vc) with bi has been investigated, and the influence of confining pressure (cp) on bi has also been studied  the results indicate that both the se and vc have a good non-linear correlation with bi, with increasing of bi, vc increases, while se decreases  besides, a good exponential relationship between cp and bi is also found, along with cp increasing, bi decreases  it can be concluded that the greater the bi is, the more prone to breakage the rock is  therefore, the proposed breakability index could be used for quantitative evaluation of rock drillability    1  introduction  rock drillability is an important parameter to estimate the difficulty of rock crushing  an accurate assessment of the rock drillability plays a major role in improving rate of penetration and reducing drilling cost in the oil and gas drilling process  however, the resistance of rock crushing is a function of multiple variables, including the type of tool and rock mechanical properties, there is no agreement to describe or measure it  currently, various researchers have evaluated the rock drillability by using different approaches  the drilling comminution was theoretically and experimentally analyzed based on a fractal approach by carpinteri a  and pugno n  [2]  they developed a model to evaluate rock drillability and energy dissipation with fractal dimensions of rock cuttings in comminution process  in addition, some rock mechanical properties and drilling parameters have long been widely used to represent rock drillability or to predict the drilling rate [3, 4, 5]  yarali o  and kahraman s  investigated the relation between the resistance of rock breaking and rock brittleness and concluded that the rock brittleness determined from compressive and tensile strength can be used for assessment of rock drillability [6]  nevertheless, it can be found that the methods mentioned above do not consider the comprehensive influence of the tools, rock properties and confining pressure, thus they cannot truly reveal the rock drillability  | 
2015-566 	 acidizing of hollow cylinder chalk specimens and its impact on rock strength and wormhole network structure |abstract  acid stimulation of limestone and chalk reservoirs is a popular method to increase production  by flowing acid through hollow cylinder chalk specimens in the laboratory, we have created specimens with wormhole networks that have allowed us to study the impact of acidizing on rock strength in dedicated solids production tests  comparing acidized samples with virgin reference samples reveal a reduction in the rock strength and earlier onset of borehole failure and solids production  the same effect is seen for both increasing depletion and increasing drawdown, but it is much more pronounced for the increasing drawdown case  even though the rock strength is clearly reduced by the acidizing, there are no signs of wormhole collapse away from the near-borehole region    1  introduction  injection of acid into limestone or chalk reservoirs may be a cost effective way to stimulate oil production  the acidizing process results in the formation of wormholes that may act as flow channels and therefore increase the near wellbore permeability of the formation [1,2]  however, these wormholes may have unwanted side effects on formation integrity, especially for high depletion or drawdown, and these effects are not fully understood [3]   we have previously studied the mechanical stability of wormholes created by acidizing of 1 5" chalk plugs by performing hydrostatic compaction tests, revealing that the wormholes collapse a few mpa below the onset of pore collapse, with a significantly larger pore-collapse pressure for oil-saturated samples as compared to saturation with brine [4]  in addition, the acidized samples showed a reduction in the pore-collapse pressure compared to intact plugs  | 
2015-567 	 using particle flow code in unloading of sliding mass |abstract  for keeping an open-pit mine operational while a giant sliding mass exists and is flowing on the benches and minerals like debris, at this time, it is necessary to unload the sliding mass (debris)  for achieving this, monitoring of sliding mass should be done along with unloading so that displacement and velocity values do not exceed a certain limit and do not cause a serious incident  one of the suitable software which is able to model this sliding mass and unload it, is pfc (particle flow code) which is based on discrete element method  this paper will describe how pfc was used to model a sliding mass in an open-pit mine and unloading it in seven stages has been done  during the unloading of sliding mass, maximum velocity and displacement among the particles have been obtained  also, in this article the angooran mine, which is the largest metal mine in iran and also one of the most economical lead and zinc mines in the world, has been studied  sliding mass volume that occurred in the angooran mine was about 12 <u+00d7>106 m3, i e  25<u+00d7>106tons  the sliding mass moved about 100 m horizontally and 45 m vertically    1  introduction  slope stability is one of the most important issues in the construction and mining activities and any mistake in analysis can lead to irreparable damage  utilizing the subsurface geological model, and results which are obtained from the field investigation and lab testing can help for analyzing slope stability by using suitable modeling methods  slope movements might be minor and be limited to falling a small boulder or might be huge and catastrophic  in many cases, advancing failure or the slope rupture can be prevented while in other cases, improvement methods cannot be remedial  one of the example of this huge slide is the angooran mine, one of the most economical lead and zinc open-pit mines in the world  angooran mine is located in the northwest of iran and has experienced a large scale slope failure in northern wall  sliding mass volume that occurred in the angooran mine was about 12 <u+00d7>106 m3, i e  25<u+00d7>106 tons (fig  1)  generally, the slope movements can affect engineering structures and human activities  slope movements are different in many ways such as hugeness, speed of incidence, and predictability  heavy or prolonged rainfall, melting snow, earthquakes, blasting in mining can be causes of slope instability  creep, tensile cracks, and water leakage locations are surficial signs of instability  the fig  2 shows a sample of tensile cracks in the angooran mine  | 
2015-568 	 application of hpc and non-linear hydrocodes to uncertainty quantification in subsurface explosion source physics |abstract  to understand shear wave generation observed during underground explosions several source-physics experiments (spe) in fractured granitic rock mass were conducted at the nevada national security site (nnss)  fractured rock present challenges: fractures are poorly characterized and sparsely sampled; the geomechanical and geophysical properties of fractures are unknown and measured at the laboratory scale; and the spatiotemporal scale-disparity between the near source explosion physics and the far-field wave propagation physics requires considerable computing resources to simulate geophysical signatures from source-to-receiver  to build a credible model of the subsurface we integrated the geological, geomechanical and geophysical characterizations conducted at nnss  because detailed site characterization is limited we numerically investigated the effects of the characterization gaps on the overall response of the system  using hpc, we performed several computational studies to identify the key geologic features that affect the most the ground motion in the near-field and in the far-field using stochastic representation of the subsurface  using brute force monte carlo simulations and sampling judiciously the large hyperspace of parameters, we have probabilistically conducted several sensitivities studies on the geological, geomechanical and geophysical parameters  such studies would help guiding site characterization efforts to provide the essential data to the modeling community   1  introduction  improved understanding of explosion generated wave motions through numerical modeling helps advancing the interpretation of seismic data for nuclear explosion monitoring (nem) and nuclear explosion forensics  currently, there are several significant challenges for the monitoring community, such as understanding the effects of emplacement material properties, depth of burial, damage, pre-stress and near-source heterogeneities on wave motion amplitudes, and the generation and partitioning of energy into different modes (e g , compressional and shear waves, body and surface waves)  understanding these phenomena will improve yield estimation and event identification by accounting for predictable effects on wave motions due to source emplacement, near source heterogeneity, and path specific propagation effects  knowledge gained on these effects can then be applied to regions where no empirical data exist, either in regions without historical explosion sources or seismic recordings or for explosions conducted under un-calibrated emplacement conditions  numerical simulations provide a versatile tool to gain insight into the generation and propagation of wave motions, including both nonlinear and linear effects  explosions are well known to involve the near instantaneous release of high temperature and pressure gas in a small volume of space  these high energy densities cause irreversible nonlinear behavior in the surrounding host material (rock) due to the generation and propagation of the outgoing hydrodynamic shock wave  it has been long appreciated that nonlinear response effects at the explosion emplacement have a strong impact on the observed far field seismic motions (e g , werth and herbst, 1963; perret and bass, 1975; murphy, 1981; rodean, 1981; denny and johnson, 1991)  however, a full understanding of these effects has been hampered by limitations in the knowledge of and computational requirements to represent all relevant nonlinear material response effects and to propagate waves from the source region to receivers  advances in numerical methods and more powerful computational resources now make it possible to routinely compute the hydrodynamic response of earth materials to buried explosions with continuing improving fidelity  these studies justify optimism that explosion generated waves for other emplacement geologies and conditions can be predicted by hydrodynamic modeling and that the proposed approach can reduce uncertainties in nem source estimates  furthermore, to understand shear wave generation observed during underground nuclear explosions several surrogate chemical source-physics experiments (spe) in fractured granitic rock mass were conducted at the nevada national security site (nnss)  spe data will be used to explain the genesis of the observed shear motions | 
2015-569 	 multiphase flow in fractured porous media: application to co2 leakages from natural and stimulated fractures |abstract  leakage to the atmosphere of a significant fraction of injected co2 would constitute a failure of a geological co2 storage project  we present a numerical model that simulates flow and transport of co2 into heterogeneous subsurface systems  the model, stotran, is a flexible numerical environment that uses state-of-the-art finite element and amr scheme implemented using mpi and openmp protocols  multiphase flow equations and the geomechanical equations are implicitly solved and either fully or sequentially coupled  in the current study, stotran has been used to simulate several scenarios spanning from a homogeneous single layered reservoir to heterogeneous multi-layered systems, which including cap-rock with embedded fractures, have been simulated under different operations of co2 injection and co2 leakages conditions  results show the impact of the injection and leakage rates on the time evolution of the spread of the co2 plume, its interception of the fractured cap-rock and the risk associated with the contamination of the overlaying aquifer  furthermore, several leakage scenarios show the intermittence behavior and development of the co2 plume in the subsurface  a remedy to co2 leakages from the reservoir using silica gels is presented to enhance and ensure a long term containment of the injected co2    1  introduction  global temperatures are increasing  atmospheric co2 concentration is increasing (figure 1)  new carbon management legislation and initiatives are based on the assumption that increased co2 levels are a major cause of global warming  several ways of reducing co2 emissions and co2 levels in the atmosphere include: improved efficiency in power generation by upgrading existing plants, higher efficiency in all new plants, relying more on renewable energy and nuclear-generated power, distribution of energy consumption among other resources and finally, carbon capture and sequestration (ccs)  of all emissions reduction mechanisms, ccs is projected to provide the largest contribution to emissions reduction in the near-term (~decade time scale)  ccs begins with capture of co2 at its source, such as a coal fired power plant, transporting the co2 to a location where it can be sequestered or stored safely away from the earth's atmosphere and oceans  three types of co2 sequestration are under way: terrestrial sequestration, geologic sequestration, and mineralization  geologic sequestration is storage of co2 within geological formations under the earth's surface  oil, gas, nonmineable coal and saline water reservoirs are those best suited for co2 sequestration (doe 1999)  | 
2015-570 	 numerical model of hydraulic fracturing fluid transport in the subsurface with pressure transient and density effects |abstract  understanding the transport of hydraulic fracturing (hf) fluid that is injected into the deep subsurface for shale gas extraction is important to ensure that shallow drinking water aquifers are not contaminated  pressure gradients, permeable pathways such as faults or improperly abandoned wellbores, and the density contrast of the hf fluid to the surrounding brine could encourage upward hf fluid migration  in contrast, very low shale permeability and well production may work to keep hf fluid at depth and remove it from the subsurface  single-phase flow and transport simulations are performed to quantify how much hf fluid is removed via the wellbore and how much reaches overlying aquifers  if a permeable pathway connects the shale reservoir to the overlying drinking water aquifer, the pressure transient due to injection and the density contrast allows rapid upward plume migration at early times, but well production reverses the direction of flow and removes a large amount of hf fluid from the subsurface  we present estimates of hf fluid migration to shallow aquifers during the first 1,000 years and show that the pressure transient from well operations should be included in subsequent numerical models while buoyancy may be neglected depending on depth and permeability    1  introduction|hydraulic fracturing, often referred to as fracking, poses potential long-term risks to drinking water resources  one of the main concerns is that chemically treated hydraulic fracturing (hf) fluid and/or highly saline brine could migrate upwards from a shale gas unit and enter shallow drinking water aquifers  the hf fluid chemicals are used as viscosity reducers, biocides, surfactants, scaling inhibitors, and for other purposes [1]; while many of the additives are biodegradable and/or have low toxicity, approximately one third of the chemicals studied by stringfellow et al  [2] do not have toxicity data, some are toxic, and some are known or suspected carcinogens  of the 2-5 million gallons of hf fluid that is injected, 5-50% returns to the surface as flowback water [1], some unknown volume moves into the small pores of the shale via capillary imbibition, and the remaining volume is free to move within the subsurface, possibly towards drinking water aquifers  public concern has prompted the epa to study the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, which include aquifer contamination via subsurface leakage [3], while other studies suggest that aquifer contamination via a subsurface pathway is virtually impossible or would occur over extremely long timescales (>106 years) [4,5] | 
2015-571 	 the use of numerical methods in simulating the influence of geological structure on the surface subsidence associated with sub-level caving |abstract  this paper briefly reviews the application of various techniques including empirical, analytical and numerical methods in analyzing the surface subsidence associated with sub-level caving  recent developments in empirical and analytical methods are first introduced  the application of numerical modelling in the characterization of surface subsidence and caving mechanisms is demonstrated using a relatively simple conceptual sub-level cave model and three numerical approaches i) a continuum finite element (fem) ii) a discontinuum distinct element (dem) and iii) hybrid finite/discrete element (fdem) with fracture; the advantages and limitations of each method are discussed  a new deformation monitoring data interpretation technique using the inverse velocity method to predict the time of failure is briefly introduced and its application to sub-level caving is presented using the fdem numerical method  recent developments in the field of the discrete fracture network (dfn) and synthetic rock mass, (srm), approaches and their use in improving our understanding of caving mechanisms are presented  finally, a new approach to modelling sub-level caving considering intact rock fracture using a dem udec-trigon method is introduced and preliminary results presented    1  introduction  cave mining methods generally include mining operations where after undercutting the orebody caves naturally based on gravity flow; these methods include block caving, panel caving and sub-level caving [1]  sub-level caving is a cost-effective mining method that enables a high degree of mechanization and automation  mining using sub-level caving induces a large area of deformation on the hanging wall with a more limited area of damage on the footwall  various parameters influence the observed hanging wall surface subsidence including depth of active mining, geometry and dip of the orebody, the mechanical properties of the intact rock and the characteristics of pre-existing discontinuities and geological structures  in general, mining using sub-level caving results in two types ground surface deformation zones: (i) the discontinuous zone and (ii) the continuous zone  these two surface deformation zones can be recognized as [2]:  • discontinuous deformation zone characterized by formation of visible cracks on the ground surface and large horizontal and vertical deformations  surface disturbance such as tension cracks, topographic steps and chimney caves are normally observed in this zone  the disturbance is more extensive in the hanging wall, although the footwall is also affected by the mining activity • continuous deformation zone characterized by uniform settlement and lowering of the ground surface which can only be detected by periodic monitoring with in general no visible surface cracking  | 
2015-572 	 an adaptive meshing approach to capture hydraulic fracturing |abstract  hydraulic fracturing is widely employed to stimulate oil and gas reservoirs to increase the productivity of these naturally fissured rock domains  different numerical techniques are available to examine how hydraulic fractures propagate  they are mainly categorized into continuum and interface-based methods  cohesive models are among the most effective class of interfacial approaches representing crack surfaces as sharp material interfaces  in lieu of a traditional cohesive model, we have formulated and employed an interfacial damage model that incorporates the processes of nucleation, growth and coalescence on the fracture surfaces  utilizing a dynamic adaptive meshing, we employed a spacetime discontinuous galerkin (sdg) finite element method to simulate hydraulic fracture propagation  our sdg implementation adaptively aligns the element boundaries with crack-path trajectories that are obtained as a part of the solution according to a crack growth criterion  thus, this model does not suffer the mesh-dependent effects encountered in most other numerical fracture models  furthermore, no discontinuous features are introduced within the elements as opposed to xfem and generalized finite element methods  adaptive mesh refinement in an area allows free nucleation, growth and branching of cracks oriented arbitrarily in the domain without any mesh bias whereas a coarse mesh can be used in other regions of the domain to utilize an efficient implementation  presenting numerical examples, we performed a sensitivity analysis of some input variables such as the magnitude of in-situ stress components, number and orientation of induced fractures is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in resolving hydraulic fracturing   1  introduction  enhancing production from shale and other tight formations has become one of the main challenges in oil industry  since these formations have extremely low permeability and low porosity, the technique of hydraulic fracturing is widely employed as a treatment to increase production rates  hydraulic fracturing treatment being rapidly developed has changed the energy industry throughout the world  understanding how fractures initiate and propagate from wellbores is necessary to efficiently perform such a costly treatment  wellbores are commonly perforated in wells with cemented liners before hydraulic fracturing is carried out  this approach is called the plug-and-perf stimulation technique  perforation plays the role of a fracture initially induced to control crack initiation and its propagation direction into the reservoir  utilizing perforations as single fractures from the wellbore toward the reservoir can avoid multiple and reoriented fractures from a wellbore  a successful treatment via hydraulic fracturing to get better propagation pattern highly depends on different parameters including the length and orientation of the perforations, the magnitude of in-situ stress components known as stress anisotropy in the plane fracturing occurs | 
2015-5737359 	 characterization of a fracture zone using seismic attributes at the in salah co2 storage project |summary  the in salah carbon dioxide storage project in algeria has injected over 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into a waterfilled tight-sand formation  during injection interferometric synthetic aperture radar (insar) revealed a doubled lobed pattern of up to 20 m surface uplift above the horizontal leg of an injection well  analysis indicates this surface uplift comes from the injection of co2 in this well  we follow previous interpretation of the pattern of depression between two lobes as caused by the opening of a sub-vertical fracture or damage zone at depth above the injection interval, which allows injected co2 to migrate upward  interpretation of 3d seismic data reveals the presence of a subtle linear push-down feature located along the insar determined surface depression between the two lobe, which we interpret to have to be caused by anomalously lower velocity from the fracture zone and the presence of co2 displacing in this feature  to enhance the seismic interpretation, we calculated many seismic attributes, including positive and negative curvatures and ant track, from the 3d seismic data  the maximum positive curvature attributes and ant-track shows the clearest linear features, with two parallel trends, which agrees well with ant-track volume and the insar observations of the depression zone  the seismic attributes provide a plausible characterization of the fracture zone extent, including height, width and length, which provides important constraint for further study of fracture behavior due to the co2 injection at in salah   introduction  the in salah gas project (a joint venture between sonatrach, bp, and statoilhydro) located in the central region of algeria is one of the world’s first industrial scale co2 storage projects to be associated with a producing gas field  natural gas produced from the krechba field is high in co2, which is separated and injected into the water leg of the field for geological storage and to help maintain formation pressure  hirst et al  (2001) described and highlighted sequence stratigraphic subdivision on the stratigraphic column of the area  over a period of about 8 years, 0 5 to 1 0 million tons of co2 per year were injected into a 20m thick, water-filled, carboniferous formation (horizon c10 2 in figure 1) with relatively low permeability  a high gamma ray log response associated with horizon c20 1 and c20 4 (referred to as “hot” shales, figure 1) mark the top and base of the lower carboniferous seal for the co2 injection interval  the nature of fracturing within the seal is important to understanding storage security at any injection site  for example, how far above the base of the a fracture penetrate is very critical for evaluation of the possibility of reservoir leakage | 
2015-575 	 micro-scale modeling of the inelastic response of a granular sandstone |abstract  this paper discusses a new computational strategy for the analysis of inelastic processes in granular rocks subjected to varying levels of confinement  the purpose is to provide a flexible and efficient tool for the analysis of failure processes in geomechanical settings  the proposed model is formulated in the framework of lattice discrete particle models (ldpm), which is here calibrated to capture the behavior of a high-porosity rock widely tested in the literature: bleurswiller sandstone  the procedure required to generate a realistic granular microstructure is described  then, the micromechanical parameters controlling the fracture response at low confinements, as well as the plastic behavior at high pressures have been calibrated  it is shown that the ldpm model allows one to explore the effect of fine-scale heterogeneity on the inelastic response of rock cores, achieving a satisfactory quantitative performance across a wide range of stress conditions  the results suggest that ldpm analyses represent a versatile tool for the characterization and simulation of the mechanical response of granular rocks, which can assist the interpretation of complex deformation/failure patterns, as well as the development of continuum models capturing the effect of micro-scale heterogeneity   1  introduction  an accurate knowledge of the engineering properties of rocks is crucial for a variety of geomechanical problems, ranging from wellbore stability, to failure in rock slopes, underground excavations, and crustal faults [1]  while strength and deformation properties are usually obtained from a limited number of in situ and/or laboratory tests, their determination is invariably affected by considerable heterogeneities [2]  such lack of homogeneity impacts engineering conclusions at all length scales and requires appropriate theoretical and computational tools   advanced numerical modeling represents a useful tool to explore how mechanical processes interact across length scales  considerable advances in this area have based on finite element computations, where heterogeneities can be incorporated at both sample and site scales [3-5]  nevertheless, to capture realistically the path-dependent response of geomaterials, continuum formulations tend to be characterized by a large number of parameters  if such constants lack clear connections with measurable attributes (e g , grain size and sorting), their calibration becomes poorly constrained  furthermore, the tendency of rock samples to undergo strain localization [6, 7] further prevents the validation and/or implementation of continuum models, requiring a direct link between strain localization and microstructural attributes [8] | 
2015-5750144 	 moment tensor inversion of single-well microseismic data: is it feasible? |summary  current paradigm asserts the impossibility of unambiguous estimation of full moment tensors from three-component microseismic data recorded in a single straight borehole  the statement of inversion nonuniqueness, related to the lack of illumination of the off-plane moment component in the zero solidangle ray apertures, tacitly assumes the slowness vectors, normal to the relevant wave fronts, to be confined to the plane containing the ray trajectories  although such arrangements of the rays and slownesses do take place for vertical wells drilled in horizontally layered isotropic and vti (transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis) formations, azimuthal anisotropy commonly expected for hydraulically fractured shales makes the slowness vectors deviate from a plane, arrange themselves into nonzero solid-angle apertures, and yield theoretically unique inverse problems for seismic moment tensors  this paper examines those problems for the anisotropy parameters characterizing fractured shales and siltstones in the bakken  their strong azimuthal anisotropy entails not only formally unique but, importantly for practical applications, well-posed inverse problems, resulting in robust estimates of the complete moment tensors from singleborehole data   introduction  focal mechanisms of microseismic events triggered in the course of hydraulic stimulations of unconventional reservoirs contain information usefully complementing the event hypocenters and magnitudes  the value of this information lies in revealing important details of rock failure, such as the orientations of fractures along which the rock breaks, the directions of slips occurring at those fractures, and the relative portions of the double couple, the compensated linear vector dipole, and the isotropic source components    estimation of full seismic moment tensor, containing six independent elements (aki and richards, 1980; shearer, 2009), relies on the measurements of vectorial amplitudes of the p- and often s-waves excited by a microseismic event or on certain attributes extracted from the amplitudes (e g , julian, 1986; julian and foulger, 1996)  all six moment components cannot be constrained in a unique fashion in the farfield range from a source when rays and slowness vectors of waves used for the moment tensor inversion (mti) are confined to a plane  this theoretical assertion, first discovered for isotropy (nolen-hoeksema and ruff, 2001) and then extended to vertical monitor wells in horizontally stratified media composed of either isotropic or vti layers (vavry?cuk, 2007), has led to a commonly held belief that unambiguous mti is impossible for ray apertures characterized by the zero solid angles (e g , baig and urbancic, 2010; leaney et al , 2011; stan?ek and eisner, 2013; song et al , 2014) unless seismic data are recorded in the source near field (song and toks<u+00a8>oz, 2011)  acting upon this perception, the industry currently employs two distinct data-acquisition geometries for carrying out full seismic mti: wide-aperture surface arrays instrumented with vertical (duncan and eisner, 2010; auger et al , 2013) or three-component (3c) geophones (birkelo et al , 2012), or arrays of 3c receivers placed in multiple wells (baig and urbancic, 2010; maxwell et al , 2010) | 
2015-577 	 coupled interactions between coal fracture containing gas and the induced shock monitored by microseismic and acoustic emissions |abstract  clear understanding of coupled interactions between coal-rock and gas subjected to static and dynamic loading will be crucial to convince that coal-gas dynamic events can be effectively monitored  here, we attempt to fill this gap by gathering microseism (ms) and acoustic emission (ae) information on the interactions of gas with coals and the effects of coal-rock fracture on abnormal gas emission  field investigations disclose two phenomena observed for interactions of coal-rock fracture and gas emission: (1) overpressuring gas in coal can induce fast crack initiation and growth ultimately producing a gas outburst with relatively low energy; and (2) under the influence of a shock wave generated by dynamic loading such as a rockburst, the coal-gas medium may be destroyed  for smaller pressure and lower desorption energy, only abnormal gas emission is generated  the abovementioned phenomena occurred in a gas-containing coal seam, ms&ae activities prior to, during, and after two unusual gas emissions and the spectrum evolutions were analyzed, and the corresponding mechanisms were revealed   1  introduction  since the first reported coal and gas outburst in the issac colliery, loire coal field, in 1843[1], more than 14,000 outbursts have occurred in china [2]  many researchers have studied relationships between coal outbursts and geological factors for different coal fields, and have come to different conclusions because of the complexity of the mechanisms  coal and gas outbursts in mines are engineering geological hazards  the dynamic stress on coal and rock material closest to the outburst source results from additional impact load produced by roof fracture or blasting, will result in sudden rupture of coal material in the critical stress condition, produce fissures forming outburst channels, and accelerate the escape velocity of gas resulting in coal and gas outbursts [3]  for coal seams containing gas, an abnormal emission due to higher pressure of gas and higher stress may be an effective precursor for a rockburst  simultaneously, recorded ms signals from roof strata may also be a precursor of coal and gas outbursts  many abnormal gas emission phenomena following rockbursts have been reported and recorded in chinese coal mines in the fuxin and beipiao coal fields in liaoning province and hegang coal mines in heilongjiang province [4-6]  in addition, in the rhine-westphal coal field, hawusike coal field, and ruhr coal field in germany, many rockbursts events have been accompanied by abnormal gas emissions [7, 8]  the correlation between rockburst and gas outburst was confirmed by ms observation, gas monitoring, and accident investigations by some scholars [9, 10-12] | 
2015-582 	 influence of fine material, humidity and vertical loads on the flowability of caved rock |abstract  flowability is defined as the flow capability of a given granular material to flow under a given drawbell geometry and vertical stress condition  gravity flow interferences of the broken material at a drawpoint (hang ups) highly influence the efficiency and production rate in block/panel caving mines  despite its importance in underground block/panel, there is a lack of methods to estimate the flow-ability and hang up frequency for a given set of geotechnical conditions (vertical stress, particle size, fine content, drawbell geometry)  the main objective of this article is to describe research conducted at the university of chile, block caving laboratory aimed to quantify the influence of the fine material, humidity and vertical load on the gravitational flow of caved rock  experiments were conducted using a 1:75 scaled physical model to evaluate the flowability of caved rock under high vertical loads and with various percentages of fine material and humidity  the results show that vertical pressure fine contents and humidity highly influence flowability and hang up frequency    1  introduction  block/panel caving mining methods are adequate for exploiting massive, low-grade ore bodies because of their low productions costs, compared to other underground mining methods  high productivity and low operational cost, in addition to automation potential, make these methods a key factor in future massive deposits mining (brown 2007)   in block/panel caving, ore production is affected by interferences associated with the caving process, especially those related to the gravity flow (chitombo 2010)  hang ups and oversize rocks are the most common phenomena, which affect the mine design, draw strategies, mine recovery and, consequently, production rate   ore flow depends on ore properties, infrastructure geometry, and stress conditions  the flow condition or ability of a granular material to flow is defined as flowability  the flowability can be qualitatively classified into free flow, intermittent flow, assisted flow, and no-flow (castro 2014)  this classification depends on the ratio of particle size to opening size of the drawpoint (laubscher 2000)  kvapil (2008) indicated that flowability depends on many parameters including particle size, extraction rate, particles<u+00b4> shape, surface roughness between particles, friction between particles, moisture content, compressibility, compaction, particle resistance as well as magnitude, distribution and direction of external loads and forces  however, to-date, the flow characteristics have not been well defined quantitatively (gomez et al 2014)  studies using gravel show that the flowability of granular material is influenced by the vertical load (fuenzalida 2012)  castro et al (2014) proposed a chart to present flowability of coarse and dry material in terms of vertical stress and drawpoint width/d50 (figure 1)  these charts were derived based on the experiments carried out using dry material and without the presence of fines  | 
2015-583 	 coupled waves at fracture intersections |abstract  fracture intersections play a crucial role in the hydraulic connectivity of flow paths in rock, yet no technique has been developed to characterize the condition of an intersection  an approach, to elastic wave characterization of intersections, is to assume each block that composes the intersection supports a wedge wave and that these wedge waves are coupled through the points of contact along an intersection  in this paper, we demonstrate the use of group theory to predict the number of vibrational modes supported by a fracture intersection  five predicted vibrational modes are supported by the intersection for the case of a fracture intersection formed from fractures with the same specific stiffness  laboratory measurements on an intersection between two orthogonal fractures showed the existence of several vibrational modes that are strongly affected by the polarization of the shear wave source and the uniaxial loading conditions   1  introduction  throughout the subsurface of the earth, fracture networks often control the three dimensional connectivity of the hydraulic flow paths  fracture networks are composed of multiple fractures and fracture intersections  although much work has been performed on elastic wave propagation across/along single fractures and sets of parallel fractures [1-4], the effect of intersections on elastic waves has been largely ignored or assumed to have little influence [5]    typically, single and parallel sets of fractures are characterized by their mechanical properties, e g  specific stiffness, which in turn provides information about the fracture topology, especially under stress [6-7]  these mechanical properties are linked to the hydraulic response of a fracture, i e , linked to the spatial distributions of apertures and contacts within the fracture [8-11]    here, we present results from a group theory analysis on an orthogonal fracture intersection under uniform loading conditions and fracture properties, i e , a highly symmetric intersection  several vibrational modes are predicted and described  the existence of these waves is demonstrated by using ultrasonic waves propagating along a fracture intersection on the laboratory scale  | 
2015-5838379 	 geomechanical assessment of seismic potential from hydraulic fracturing |summary  a coupled hydro-mechanical model is used to evaluate fault activation associated with hydraulic fracturing in the horn river basin  the model is used to simulate hydraulic fracture growth through a discrete fracture network, examining the pore pressure diffusion and associated fracture dilation and shearing  based on the geomechanics, the seismic activity can be predicted and used to compare with the actual seismicity monitored during the fracture treatment  the synthetic microseismic prediction includes location, timing and magnitude of the activity and can be used to validate the geomechanical attributes and calibrate the model to match the field data  applying such a microseismic geomechanics approach not only improves the interpretation of the microseismic image but also improves the understanding of the geomechanical response of the reservoir   in this study, the impact of the hydraulic fracturing on a preexisiting fault was examined to quantify seismic hazard  a geomechancial model was created to investigate a horn river basin hydraulic fracture and the associated seismic magnitudes  the model was designed to investigate the mechanism of fault activation and the impact of fracturing at different locations around the fault  the study indicated that the stimulated fracture network had to grow directly into the fault in order for the injection pressure front to trigger fault slip  geomechanical assessment of absolute seismic hazard can be used to modify the engineering design prior to operations to minimize the seismic hazard including the placement of the well, and modifiy staging along the well to avoid fracturing in the regions likely to lead to fault activation  in scenarios where induced seismicity occurs during the treatment, the method can also be used to examine operational changes to lessen the relative seismic hazard    introduction|with hightened public concerns of environmental issues with hydraulic fracturing, attention is raising around the few isolated cases of injection-induced seismicity  an increasing number of reports have recently been made of felt seismicity associated directly with hydraulic fracture treatments or disposal of waste water from extraction of unconventional resources  in order to safely and efficiently develop unconventional reservoirs in areas of concern, industry protocols have been developed to deal with induced seismicity issues  typically these protocols rely on local seismic monitoring to define traffic light systems, where operations are modified depending on the seismicity levels  as part of these protocols, methodologies are required to assess the seismic hazard both prior to the initiation of operations in addition to modifications to planned operations when required by traffic light levels | 
2015-5839756 	 modeling elastic waves with lattice spring model |summary  in this paper, the lattice spring model (lsm) is adopted in forward modeling of elastic waves propagation in solid medium by combination with the verlet algorithm  different from the traditional methods, such as finite difference method (fdm), finite element method (fem) etc , lsm is a new method which is not based on the wave equations, but on the microcosmic mechanism that causes wave propagation  firstly, the origin and history of lsm is introduced  secondly, the theoretical framework of lsm is elaborated and a stability condition for the evolution of this system is deduced  then, some numerical results of lsm are demonstrated and they are compared with the wave fields obtained by fdm  finally, a brief conclusion is drawn based on the previous discussions    introduction  first devised by grest and webman in 1984, lattice spring model (lsm) is a collection of linear springs connected at nodes distributing on a cubic lattice used for describing solid medium (grest and webman, 1984; hassold and srolovitz, 1989)  in order to model materials of different poisson’s ratios, angular springs are added to the original linear spring system (wang, 1989)  ladd and kinney (1997) developed this model by taking the idea of elastic element to improve its calculation precision  such a simple model is sufficient to simulate heterogeneous elastic medium, and its application can be seen in modeling deformation and failure (ladd and kinney, 1997; buxton et al , 2001; zhao et al , 2011)   as is known to all, extensive research has been performed to solve the dynamic problems involving waves, and fdm is the most frequently used numerical method, which solves the wave equation by finite difference approximation of its partial derivative (toomey and bean, 2000)  yim and sohn (2000) adopted a model similar to lsm for visualization of ultrasonic waves, but the evolution of wave fields are calculated by fdm  pazdniakou and adler (2012) made a further introduction of lsm and laid the foundation for its potential application in wave propagation in porous media in the low frequency band  xia et al  (2014) modeled p waves from low frequencies (seismic frequency) to high frequencies (sonic log frequency) by importing a stability conditional for lsm dynamics  | 
2015-584 	 a combined method to measure biot’s coefficient for rock |abstract  biot’s coefficient can be expressed by a few different equations, and consequently, these equations may represent different approaches to measure this coefficient  we developed a combined method to measure the biot’s coefficient by three different approaches based on three different equations using a single laboratory setup  the methodology is to measure the bulk modulus of a rock sample by conducting a drained hydrostatic test, and then to adjust the confining pressure and pore pressure to derive their correlation upon a constant volumetric strain condition, and then to conduct a series of drained hydrostatic compression and hydrostatic depletion tests to obtain the relationship between pore volume and rock bulk volume changes  the last step is to unify the pore pressure and confining pressure or keep a constant difference between confining and pore pressure in case the pore fluid and confining fluid are different to simulate an unjacketed hydrostatic test to acquire the grain bulk modulus of the rock  this method requires accurate and direct strain measurement and a fully saturated rock sample  this method allows us to acquire the biot’s coefficient using a single rock applying different loading conditions based on three different equations  we demonstrated the measurement methods for both permeable rocks (berea sandstone and indiana limestone) and relatively impermeable rocks (westerly granite and asmari limestone)  different pore fluids (mineral oil, de-ionized water and nitrogen gas) were used for different rocks in order to achieve better measurements, and thus there are minor differences of the operation when dealing with different types of rocks  | 
2015-5840458 	 goaf water quantity estimation by mine transient electromagnetic method |summary  in china, goaf water is major source of coal mine water disaster  at present, goaf water quantity is detected by drilling in the coal mine roadway, and the disadvantage is high workload and low efficiency  therefore, mine transient electromagnetic method was proposed in this expanded abstract  after the calculation of late-period resistivity and time-depth conversion, the spatial distribution range of goaf aquifer was detected  combined with water-filling coefficient of the aquifer, goaf water quantity can be estimated  the field test in the no 4 coal seam goaf of 80101 workface in jude mine of shanxi, western china, shows that the error percentage of the predicted water quantity is below 1 5%    introduction  the mine transient electromagnetic method, mtem for short, is a geophysical method used in underground roadways of coal mines for observing the secondary eddy current field to detect the time-space distribution  by measuring the change rule of the secondary magnetic field over time during the power-off period, the geoelectricity features at different depths can be obtained  based on transient electromagnetic principle, ungrounded loop-line can transmit down pulse-type primary field, which may induce an eddy current, then the spatial and temporal distribution of secondary field caused by the eddy current can be observed by coil (li 2014;yu 2007; liu 2009; jiang 2010; wang 2012)  from figure 1 it can be seen that, mtem receives induced signals during the time-off period, which will be attenuated over time    featuring light equipment, little lateral influence, mtem was applied in water disaster prevention and control  however, in the case of processing method restraints, the analyses are usually qualitative, which cannot meet the standard of quantification, to a certain extent, hold up its wider application (qin 2014; tao 2009; huang 2010; xu2012)  thus, this expanded abstract will create new method to calculate mtem response by means of equivalent substitution, interpret the diffusion law of mtem field by theoretical formula, calculate physical parameters, and conduct 3d apparent resistivity imaging and quantitative analyses of detection results |

2015-5869039 	 high-fidelity 4d forward modelling as part of a redefined closed-loop seismic reservoir monitoring framework: a case study |summary  forward modelling is a fundamental part of time-lapse seismic feasibility studies and closed-loop seismic reservoir monitoring schemes  the forward modelling workflow represents a complex interaction between multiple domains, each contributing its own set of assumptions, models, and simplifications, based on a priori information  to allow for the best use of the modelled data, the aim ought to be to keep the level of modelling-introduced noise as low as possible to allow for an optimized decision making process on the specifics of a particular time-lapse seismic project  these considerations will have a profound impact on cost and production  it is therefore key to keep 4d signatures subsurface-relevant, avoiding any contributions from low-fidelity forward modelling  to address this challenge, the paper at hand offers a redefined closed-loop seismic reservoir monitoring framework that draws from and caters for a field-scale dynamic integrated earth model  the validity of the framework and its implications are demonstrated using the purpose built chimera model which comprises a four-way closure, faulted structure, and represents a turbidite-type reservoir with clastic depositional sequence    introduction  literature produces many successful examples of timelapse seismic case studies, with carefully analyzed 4d signatures  calvert (2005) and johnston (2013) offer detailed insight in this regards, by also simultaneously sketching the state-of-the-art of time-lapse seismic processing  however, quantitative and even qualitative comparisons of differences between predicted and actually measured time-lapse seismic data are much less performed and discussed in open literature, despite the obvious benefit for model reconciliation  an explanation can be found in the assumptions and methodology used for the feasibility study which can be too simplistic to warrant for a meaningful comparison   when examining 4d signatures, it often turns out that the observed 4d signal is considerably bigger, smaller or different in shape than what was expected from the preceding feasibility study, producing an e term  given the level of uncertainty within a 4d feasibility study performed, such a mismatch is even expected and the <u+03b5> term can be further decomposed into three chief elements:| 
2015-587 	 coupled modeling of the strength development and distribution within cemented paste backfill structure |abstract  once placed in the underground mine excavations (stopes), cemented paste backfill (cpb) structures have to satisfy certain mechanical resistance requirements to ensure a safe underground working environment for all mining personnel  moreover, mine backfill failures have considerable financial ramifications and can result in fatalities or injuries  one of the key parameters for assessment of the mechanical resistance of cpb structure and often used in the practice is its strength; namely, unconfined compressive strength (ucs)  knowing the time at which the cpb reaches its reasonable strength is very important for reducing the mining cycle and ensuring the safety of mine workers  in this paper, a numerical model is developed (and implemented into flac software) for predicting the ucs development and distribution of undrained hydrating cpb structure, taking into account the coupled effects of temperature (thermal factor) and binder hydration (chemical factors)  data from field and laboratory studies are employed to validate the developed model  the validation results show a good consistency between the predicted and the field and laboratory results  the developed tool is then used to simulate the strength development within cpb structures in several practical cases  the developed tool can contribute to more cost-effective and safer design of cpb structures   1  introduction  mining industries contribute strongly to the economy of canada and many other countries [1-4]  aside from significant economic contributions, mining activities also generate a large amount of solid waste, such as waste rock and tailings  in canada, it is estimated that about 500-650 million tons of waste are generated annually [5-6]  this issue is also faced by mining industries worldwide because they follow the same mining principle for extracting valuable minerals and disposing waste [7-8]  in the not so-distant past, surface impoundments were the most widely used method of tailings disposal, and even the returning of tailings to underground mines has long been practiced for the purpose of assisting mining operations [9]  however, the surface disposal of such waste can create several environmental and geotechnical problems    public perception and strict government regulations with regards to the disposal of such waste compel the mining industry to develop new strategies which are environmentally sound and cost effective  in this scenario, the recycling of such waste into mining or civil engineering construction materials have become a great challenge for the mining and civil engineering community [10]  in recent decades or years, there is an increasing trend to make the tailings a useful construction material [e g , 11-12]  one of these materials is mine backfill  in mine backfilling, the tailings and/or waste rocks are returned to the underground to fill the voids left by ore extracting in the form of mine backfills (hydraulic backfill, rockfill, and cemented paste backfill)  cemented paste backfill (cpb, mixture of dewatered tailings, water and binders) is the most used method of mine backfilling in canada and many other countries  as a relatively new technology, cpb has been increasingly and intensively used for the backfilling of previously mined-out underground voids (which are called stopes) in many mines around the world over the past three decades [13-14]  the application of cpb can produce substantial economic and environmental benefits as well as ensure a safe work environment in underground mines| 
2015-5872678 	 seismic anisotropy and apparent symmetry from basin and stress history simulations: theory and example |summary  stressed, fractured rocks can have complex symmetry  understanding the compaction and burial history of a basin can be used to better build complex models based on geological concepts and numerical modeling  in this example, we show how 3d stress modeling through basin evolution in time (4d geomechanical basin modeling) enables us to identify fracture orientation based on failure criteria and direction of minimum principal stresses which together with the structural geometry and rock physics modeling can be transformed into the anisotropic elastic stiffness tensor and its symmetry  we demonstrate this integrated concept on a gulf of mexico basin model    introduction  modern seismic imaging uses tilted transverse anisotropy (tti) and tilted orthorhombic (tor) models to properly image and position  however, building a low-symmetry anisotropic model is a complex process as many rock parameters are needed to describe the subsurface  the relations between geomechanics stress and seismic velocity and anisotropy have been used in the past to predict seismic velocities (bachrach and sengupta, 2008; rodrigues et al , 2014)  direct correlation between stress, fractures, and anisotropy (thanoon et al , 2015; mathewson et al , 2015) have been recently observed  however, the elastic properties of the basin are not related only to present day stress and fractures, but also to the history of the basin and the stress path experienced by the sediments  a new research area named as geophysical basin modeling (gbm) has been used to show relations between geohistory and rock properties  this research area have been branching from traditional rock physics and we believe will play a major role in using rock physics relations within their proper geological context  in this paper we present the use of geophysical basin modeling with rock physics to analyze the expected present day anisotropy and symmetry  | 
2015-5873113 	 a workflow for rapid modelling of production-related geomechanical changes and 4d timeshifts |summary  we present a 4d geomechanics workflow that can be used to rapidly screen fields for geomechanical changes occurring during production and estimate the associated time-shifts that you would expect to see in 4d seismic data  this workflow gives a first-order estimate of the reservoir and overburden deformation occurring due to pressure changes in the reservoir  this estimate can be used to model the velocity changes occurring between repeat seismic surveys and the magnitude of the accompanying 4d time-shift signal  we give an example from a case study that shows how this workflow can be used for geomechanical screening and 4d seismic feasibility studies   introduction  all reservoirs experience some amount of deformation during production  reducing the pore pressure in a reservoir increases the effective stress on the reservoir rock, causing the rock to compact  the amount of compaction depends on the magnitude of the pressure drop and the compressibility of the reservoir rock  conversely, a pressure increase during injection will cause the reservoir to expand  these changes at the reservoir level propagate into the overburden causing it to deform too  however, the amount of deformation at the seabed is always less than the amount of deformation at depth due to support from the sideburden  as a result, the overburden experiences unloading when the reservoir is compacting or compression when the reservoir expands  seismic velocities are sensitive to these changes  extension of the overburden causes microcracks to open up, reducing seismic velocities  compaction causes hardening of grain contacts as they are pushed together, increasing seismic velocities  although these velocity changes may be small, their cumulative effect over hundreds or thousands of meters combined with the change in path length to the reservoir can lead to measurable travel-time changes between repeat seismic surveys as illustrated in figure 1   in general, reservoirs that experience significant geomechanical changes during production can be grouped into three categories: 1) compressible chalks such as the valhall reservoir in the north sea which has undergone more than 10m of compaction since production started in 1982 (kristiansen & plischke, 2010), 2) unconsolidated turbidite sands such as holstein and genesis in the gulf of mexico (ebaid et al, 2008; hodgson et al, 2007), and 3) high pressure reservoirs such as elgin, franklin and shearwater in the north sea (de gennaro et al, 2008; staples et al, 2007) | 
2015-5878182 	 converted-wave contributions to anisotropic shale behavior |summary|predicting “frackability” using seismic data has become a very important area of investigation for high-grading locations for drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation  most seismic studies to characterize brittleness use conventional p-wave data and isotropic elastic inversion methods  however, ps-wave joint inversion and s-wave splitting methods have successfully been used to investigate shale plays as well as other unconventional resource plays    anisotropic behavior related to stress direction and the geomechanics of shales has been claimed to help identify optimal drilling and stimulation locations  also, it has been shown that use of conventional elastic parameters for characterizing “brittleness” should include anisotropic corrections to obtain proper behavior  including ps-wave seismic data should improve anisotropy estimates and identification of potential fracture locations    introduction|the ability to predict how and where fracturing is likely to occur using seismic data has become a very important area of investigation for high-grading locations for drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation  often, horizontal well and stimulation programs based on regular patterns are only marginally productive  identification of “brittleness” and potential fracture locations from seismic data could improve this situation by directing a more targeted drilling program   most seismic studies to characterize brittleness use conventional p-wave data and elastic inversion methods  norton et al  (2010) show that conventional seismic methods of amplitude variation with offset or angle (avo or ava) inversion and fault mapping can estimate useful elastic properties for predicting geomechanical properties related to stimulation  they observe that hydraulically induced fracture networks prefer lower poisson’s ratio (pr) rock in the montney shale in ne canada  also, there appears to be a lack of microseismic events in the vicinity of secondary faults    gray (2012) uses p-wave 3d wide-angle, wide-azimuth data to compute young’s modulus e and poisson’s ratio i to predict the differential horizontal stress ratio (dhsr) in the colorado shale in alberta, canada  the ratio (oh-oh)/oh can be estimated from azimuthal ava (avaz) inversion, where oh and oh are the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses, respectively, and is a function of e and i  the azimuthal anisotropic behavior of dhsr is an indication of how the reservoir is likely to fracture  also, he suggests that both wide-angle, wide-azimuth, conventional 3d pwave pwave data, and multi-component converted wave (pswave) seismic data should allow the estimation of these parameters | 
2015-5884551 	 coupled geomechanical and fluid flow modeling for injection induced seismicity prediction |summary  while creating the a lift for local economies and technological advancements, shale gas development also has raised significant concern on surface and groundwater contamination, air pollution, and more recently induced seismicity and geo-hazard risks  in this study, the stress alteration along a fault is estimated using coupled geomechanics and fluid flow modeling  examples from gas shale and shale oil reservoir hydraulic fracturing and waste disposal operations are provided toward a better understanding and predictive methodology for induced seismicity  the role of various factors on induced seismicity due to fluid injection is discussed  it is shown that microseismic monitoring along with coupled geomechanics and fluid flow models and statistical analysis of the microseismic data can provide a good lead on prediction of fault reactivation and induced seismicity |introduction  in the united states, the states with large petroleum reserves and significant unconventional development activities are considered to be the areas with minor seismicity and very little potential earthquakes  however, recent sizable earthquakes (2 - 5 3 richter) in these low seismicity areas in the states of texas, colorado, pennsylvania and ohio have raised further concerns and associated interest in the role of fluid disposal as well as the hydraulic fracturing and production on induced seismicity   the u s  geological survey (usgs) recently reported more than 300 earthquakes magnitude m > 3 richter in the period between 2010 and 2012 compared to an average rate of 21 events per year in the period of 1967–2000  most events are associated with waste disposal or water injection for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery  magnitude of these small earthquakes tends to increase as the total injected fluid volumes  injection pressures and the rates have been studied among the key influencing factors of these tremors   microseismic events induced from the hydraulic fracturing operations typically vary in magnitude from –4 0 to –1 0  induced seismicity from the wastewater injection, as stated in national research council report (2012), has occurred in less than 1% of the injection wells  induced seismicity with magnitude m > 1 richter scale from hydraulic fracturing operations is also very rare while there is more recorded evidence of induced seismicity activities with higher energy release from enhanced geothermal system operations | 
2015-5884877 	 the determination of reservoir poroelastic properties from oscillating pore pressure method |summary  we demonstrate that the oscillating pore pressure method is suitable for measuring basic set of rock’s poroelastic properties, such as drained bulk modulus, biot-willis and skempton’s coefficients  the oscillating pore pressure method has been initially developed as a method to determine hydraulic properties of rocks (kranz et al , 1990; fischer, 1992)  we equip our samples with strain gages and subsequently measure deformation, caused by a harmonic pore pressure pulse, propagating through sample’s porous space  by doing so we simultaneously determine poroelastic and hydraulic properties  one of the main goals of the poroelastic measurement is to improve the estimation of the storage capacity from purely hydraulic pore pressure oscillating method  we show that the storage capacity values from the oscillating pore pressure method alone are overestimated by the order of magnitude; measured poroelastic properties for the tested samples are in agreement with literature data  hence, oscillating pore pressure method is capable of accurately measuring poroelastic properties  |introduction  the oscillating pore pressure method for measurements of permeability and storage capacity has been previously presented in details (kranz et al , 1990; fischer, 1992; song and renner, 2007)  it is based on inducing time-harmonic diffusive fluid flow through the porous sample and subsequent measurement of the upstream and downstream pressure signals  the propagated through the specimen pressure sinusoid is always phaselagged and attenuated on the downstream side  once the amplitude ratio and phase has been calculated, we can solve the diffusivity equation with oscillatory boundary conditions and estimate the permeability and storage capacity of the sample   although it allows accurate determination of permeability, the estimation of the storage capacity yields large errors, sometimes on the order of several magnitudes (bernab<u+00b4>e et al , 2006)  as mentioned by bernab<u+00b4>e et al  (2006) the values of the storage capacity are particularly uncertain if the experiment employs large downstream reservoirs  this is usually done in case of high permeability samples (100 md and higher) in order to achieve measurable phase and amplitude ratio of the two pressure signals    the storage capacity of the sample is a poroelastic constant, responsible for fluid storage in the sample and defined as (wang, 2000; k<u+00a8>umpel, 1991): | 
2015-5900945 	 stress-induced signatures in 4d seismic data: evidence of overburden stress arching |summary  several authors have demonstrated the use of coupled geomechanical simulations to explain changes in traveltimes derived from time-lapse seismic surveys over compacting reservoirs (see hatchell et al , 2003; sayers, 2004; hatchell and bourne, 2005; herwanger et al  2007; janssen et al , 2007; kosco et al, 2010; herwanger et al , 2013)  under this same concept, we have employed large-scale geomechanical simulations to translate reservoir depletion values into rock deformations and subsurface velocity changes  we apply this methodology to channelized turbidite complexes of the dalia field, located in block 17, offshore west africa, aiming to generate a geomechanically derived overburden time-shift model and validate predicted signatures against an actual 4d seismic monitor survey  our results are able to replicate both slow-down and speedups in the vicinity of depleted sand bodies, following patterns consistent with stress-arching effects in the overburden   geomechanical modeling of overburden behavior  full-field geomechanical models have been previously employed in the dalia field to successfully address infill issues (see onaisi, 2014; pourpak et al , 2014; onaisi et al , 2015)  building on this experience, this paper explores the notion of how geomechanical models can assist in explaining production-induced time-lapse seismic signatures  because reservoir seismic velocity changes are also strongly affected by saturation changes, most of the scope of this paper is limited to the overburden immediately overlying the reservoir   the dalia field, located in block 17, offshore west africa, is characterized by four main sedimentary complexes, called upper main channel, lower main channel, lower flanks, and camelia  the reservoirs are of lower miocene age, consisting of unconsolidated sandy turbiditic deposits  depositional and erosional geometries, along with sedimentary facies distribution, affect fluid flow by a complex network of preferential pathways (pluchery et al , 2013)  the reservoir layers lie not very far (about 800 m) below the seabed, forming unconsolidated and heterogeneous oil reservoirs (see prat el al , 2010; pluchery et al , 2013)  this area is also characterized by high-resolution seismic data (down to 10 m) that is used for fine reservoir characterization and monitoring (gonzalez-carballo, et al , 2006; vemba, et al , 2011)  as described by onaisi et al  (2015), a geomechanical model was constructed based on seismic inversion data, representing present-day conditions throughout the reservoir and its surroundings  for such purposes, we used a finite element geomechanical modeling engine (koutsabeloulis and hope, 1998) to produce a 3d map of stress and strain magnitudes and orientations that vary both laterally and vertically  the model uses pore pressures from a reservoir simulator, structure, rock mechanical properties, and far-field horizontal stresses imposed as boundary conditions to simulate the initial stress state of the field, calibrated with well measurements and with drilling experience | 
2015-5902954 	 orthorhombic model for geomechanical applications in unconventional shale reservoirs |summary  geomechanics of orthorhombic media (a relatively appropriate model for fractured shales), with the assumption of linear elasticity, was investigated using theoretical data  this paper presents the equations for computing anisotropic mechanical properties of orthorhombic media (poisson’s ratios “vij”, young’s moduli “ei”, and minimum/maximum horizontal stresses “<u+03c3>h and <u+03c3>h”)  although nine independent parameters (nine stiffness matrix, cij, components) are used to define the elastic properties of orthorhombic media, only six cij components are used to define the above mechanical properties  simplified equations for computing anisotropic stresses in orthorhombic media (simplified orthorhombic model) are also presented; these equations yield accurate estimates of the anisotropic stresses in heavily fractured media (shear wave splitting or sws > 10%)  although the simplified equations for the anisotropic stresses are defined using six cij components, <u+03c3>h or <u+03c3>h can be defined using only three mechanical properties (e g , two poisson’s ratio values and one young’s modulus value)  to investigate the mechanical behavior of an orthorhombic medium, a theoretical model was used to create data for fractured shales with two sets of vertical fractures (vti background + two sets of rectangular, vertical fractures), with variable fracture density (which results in variable sws values)  based on the modeling results, the values of poisson’s ratios and young’s moduli decrease with increasing fracture density (although a few moduli will remain almost unchanged)  for all fracture densities, the magnitude of stress anisotropy (<u+03c3>h-<u+03c3>h) can be accurately computed using the simplified orthorhombic model and, for higher fracture densities, the simplified model converge to the exact values  <u+03c3>h can be accurately computed using a simpler vti model, whereas the <u+03c3>h calculation using vti or isotropic models will result in significant errors    introduction  unconventional shale reservoirs have extremely low permeabilities  therefore, natural fractures play an important role in these reservoirs  areas with high densities of natural fractures are favorable for drilling  natural fractures usually occur in one or two sets; they are usually vertical (if the vertical stress is the first principal stress)  if two sets of vertical fractures exist, they are usually orthogonal to one another (e g , thomsen, 2002)  although the vertical transverse isotropic (vti) model has improved the prediction of anisotropic stress predictions (e g , higgins et al , 2008), it cannot take into account the presence of natural fractures in the rock  to consider the vertical natural fractures (one set or two sets of orthogonal fractures) and the intrinsic lamination of shales, the orthorhombic model should be used (e g , musgrave, 1970)  an orthorhombic medium is defined using nine independent parameters (cij components)  using the voigt notation, hooke’s law for orthorhombic media can be written in a matrix/vector form:| 
2015-5906171 	 utilization and interpretation of high-confidence microseismic source mechanisms |summary  we examine some of the advantages of surface microseismic monitoring and suggest ways in which these advantages can be used to improve the utilization and interpretation of microseismic results  in particular, we show that microseismic events with high-confidence source mechanisms can be used to directly construct fracture networks   introduction  surface microseismic monitoring and downhole microseismic monitoring each offer trade-offs in value  the recognized technical advantages of downhole monitoring include significantly greater numbers of detected events and better depth accuracy; the recognized technical advantages of surface monitoring include better horizontal spatial accuracy and better characterization of the event source mechanisms (eisner et al , 2011)   accurately located high-confidence events with well-determined source mechanisms can change our interpretation strategy for microseismic data  instead of interpreting clouds of events, which requires a statistical approach to infer the presence of fractures, we can build an interpretation, and a fracture network, directly from individual events that each provides a meaningful indication of the presence of a fracture  we call such a fracture network an event-guided fracture network   basic methodology: image domain pattern recognition  classic inversion for source mechanisms from microseismic data requires the identification of the amplitude and polarity of the first arrivals of events in the time domain, which requires much higher signal/noise ratios than are commonly available in surface microseismic data (eaton and forouhideh, 2011)  for this reason in surface microseismic surveys the source mechanisms may be determined for only a few large events, and smaller events are sometimes assumed to have similar mechanisms  however, it is likely that large events and small events actually have very different mechanisms  for example large events may be related to faulting while smaller events may be related to newly-created hydraulic fractures   image domain pattern recognition can be used to determine the source mechanisms of microseismic surface events with very low signal/noise ratios  figures 1a and 1b illustrate the technique  figure 1a shows prestack traces from an obvious strike-slip event, after correction for the travel times  the polarity reversals from the radiation pattern are evident in the time domain in the left panel of figure 1a, and the right panel of figure 1a shows the event in the image domain  the four lobes of the event are an imaging artifact that is caused by the polarity reversals in the radiation pattern  figure 1b shows the same event, but with noise added that is 20 times higher than the rms level of each input trace  after noise is added the event is no longer visible in the prestack traces, and is now a “sub-visible” event  the lobes of the event are still visible in the image domain, and these image lobes can be used to determine the source mechanism  in both cases the source mechanism solution is shown by an inset “beachball” display  the noise caused the solution to result in a slightly different dip, and with a small crack-opening component, but the solutions are quite similar considering that in one case the event is completely buried in noise  the challenge in pattern recognition techniques such as this is computing efficiency (bagon and galun, 2011), but for hydraulic fracturing we can benefit by restricting the solutions to those that are geologically reasonable | 
2015-5910114 	 optimizing hydraulic fracture spacing and frack timing in unconventionals – taking advantage of time-dependent pressure diffusion |summary  due to low natural gas prices, low production rates, and increased development costs, many operators have shifted operations from shale gas to liquid-rich shale plays  one means to make shale gas plays more attractive is to enhance well production through stimulation optimization  in numerous previous works, the authors have highlighted the geomechanical causes and important parameters for hydraulic fracture optimization in naturally fractured shale plays  the authors have, for example, emphasized the impact that stress shadows, from multiple hydraulic fractures, has on increasing the resistance of natural fractures and weakness planes to shear stimulation  the authors have also shown the critical role that in-situ pressure and pressure changes have on natural fracture shear stimulation  in this paper, we present the results of a discrete element model numerical study of both hydraulic fracture spacing and hydraulic fracture timing in a fully hydro-mechanical coupled fashion  the pressure changes in the natural fracture system of an unconventional play, due to hydraulic fracturing, often follow a diffusion-type process, which means the pressure changes are time dependent  as shown in previous works of the authors and others, the time-dependent changes in the in-situ pressure can have a marked impact on shear stimulation  the study performed quantitatively looked at the impact of hydraulic fracture spacing as a function of in-situ pressure change and time for key parameters such as the in-situ stress ratio, natural fracture characteristics, and natural fracture mechanical properties  the results of the study help improve the understanding of in-situ pressure and hydraulic fracture timing on stimulation optimization and enhanced hydrocarbon production  the study also provides a means to optimize hydraulic fracture spacing and increase shear stimulation for unconventional wells   introduction  advances in horizontal drilling resulted in a shale-gas boom since the 1990s, as horizontal drilling allows for many hydraulic fractures to be created along a single horizontal well (king, 2010)  due to the injection of fracture fluid, for creating the fracture, and proppant to keep the fracture open permanently, both pore pressure and stress distribution are altered around the hydraulic fracture  a key factor in successful hydraulic fracturing for unconventionals is shear stimulation around the fracture  while the stress shadow stabilizes natural fractures, increasing pressure within the natural fractures and weakness planes decreases the effective stresses, which results in increasing the possibility of shear slippage and shear stimulation | 
2015-5915362 	 passive seismic localization without velocity model: application and uncertainty analysis |summary  passive seismic events are generally made by fault displacement, drilling, and hydraulic fracturing during high-pressure fluid injection into boreholes  there are two general configurations of seismic receiver arrays for passive seismic event monitoring: surface and down-hole  surface arrays provide a larger aperture and hence greater coverage of the focal sphere in comparison to down-hole arrays  however, surface location techniques generally require knowledge of the velocity model to be known a priori  an alternative approach is passive seismic localization which is the procedure of identifying the focal point for the seismic wave field, which in many situations will coincide with the true source position  whilst these procedures do require assumptions about the nature of the velocity model, it is not required to be parameterized a priori  in this paper, we propose a surface passive localization technique which is applied to both 2d synthetic and 3d field data examples  this work verifies that despite the approximations a reliable event location is achieved  the uncertainty of the proposed technique in the localization of passive seismic events using the bootstrap method was also studied   introduction  unlike active seismic imaging, passive seismic imaging does not depend on the use of a dedicated controlled seismic source  earthquakes caused by fault displacement, micro-earthquakes (micro seismic) caused by hydraulic fracturing, and vibration generated by drilling, are considered as passive seismic sources  analysis of the distribution of passive seismic events has proved a useful tool in mining exploration as well as unconventional reservoir development in oil and gas industry (chambers et al , 2014)  it has been used in the mining industry for over a century with different applications: a) estimating seismic velocity down the bore hole in seismic-while-drilling methods (sun et al , 2014), b) monitoring mining-induced seismicity for the management of hazards in deep hard rock mines (mikula et al , 2008) and c) detecting the position of drill-bit in the subsurface, such as in the case of coil tube (ct) drilling, when there is uncertainty about the position caused by the flexibility of the tube (mokaramian and rasouli, 2013)   there are two methods of passive seismic monitoring: down-hole and surface (maxwell et al , 2010)  surface passive monitoring provides higher fold and wider aperture above the desired target and allows the possibility of monitoring larger volumes (chambers, 2010, duncan and eisner, 2010)  the intrinsic s/n for this technique is low but post-stack s/n can be vastly improved with the fold of the data  however, accuracy of location algorithms depends on the subsurface velocity model which is often not available (pavlis, 1986) | 
2015-5923252 	 3d shape optimization based on unstructured triangle/tetrahedral mesh deformation |summary  we study a polyhedral representation of regional subsurface structures partitioned into unstructured tetrahedral mesh  the geomechanics-related discontinuities are adaptively represented as triangulated interior surfaces as seperators for blocky subdomains, or “shapes”, without asssumption on smoothness  we present a two-step framework conducting mesh deformation by evolving the interior surface based on the gradient flow derived from the hausdorff distance between an initially guessed geometry and a target polyhedral representing the true geological structure, and then elastically deforming and modifying the volume mesh under element quality constraints  we implement a series of refinement and coarsening operations, allowing topological change, and introduce a polyhedra based level set function to retrack the interior surface, as a feedback from volume modification to surface mesh optimization, which deals with the contacting and breaking up problems  |introduction  in the full-waveform inversion (fwi) in reflection seismology, we consider a parameterization of earth structure as a piecewise smooth elastic material  the neumann-to-dirichlet map is considered as data, and a sparsely segmented model parameter facilitates the convergence of landweber iteration  in the sense of sparsity, we consider a polyhedral representation of shape, that is, discontinuities in model parameters that stand for real geological structures such as fault planes, salt boundaries, ocean bottoms, sediment layers, etc  a related approach to blocky representation of geological models is found in shin (1988), and implementation of triangular unstructured meshes can be find in hale (2002)  such representations are initiated via segmentation using an image of material parameters as input, generating interfaces that divide subdomains  considering the generality of geological structures, we assume no smoothness for the shape of interfaces  in general inverse problems, a piecewise constant wavespeed recovery in the finite dimenstional setting with domain partitioning is provided with a lipschitz stability estimate in beretta et al  (2014)  instead of recovering a continuous class of wavespeed, we hereby limit the elastic attributes to finite set of values, obtained from geological knowledge of relevant mineral types  we use a fully unstructured tetrahedral mesh with adaptive deformation, quality control, and local refinements  a hiearchical structure can be applied in determing intermediate levels of subdomains and interfaces for corresponding secondary structures  | 
2015-5924540 	 supervised and unsupervised learning: how machines can assist quantitative seismic interpretation |summary  in this study, we use an example in a barnett shale play to demonstrate how supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques provide the right leverages for seismic interpreters  by analyzing seismic facies map generated by unsupervised self-organizing map, gamma ray estimated by artificial neural network, and brittleness index estimated by supervised proximal support vector machine, we arrive at frackability and lithofacies interpretation of the lower barnett shale  we find strong agreement between interpreted frackability in the lower barnett shale with microseismic events   introduction  frackability, which can be measured by the brittleness index (bi) of reservoir rocks, is a key parameter of recovering unconventional shale reservoirs  in this study we use both unsupervised learning technique (self-organizing map or som) and supervised learning technique (proximal support vector machine or psvm) trying to estimate bi using five petrophysical attributes  from unsupervised som, we cannot directly get bi from the inputs, but can have clustered lithofacies, which need to be further calibrated with other petrophysical and engineering data  from supervised psvm, we can directly calculate bi on seismic data based on the relation obtained from a training well  because gamma ray is a good indicator of clay minerals as well as total organic carbon (toc) which generally make a rock ductile, we also compare the estimated bi with a gamma ray volume estimated using artificial neural network (ann)  good virtual correlations are identified among som facies, bi and gamma ray volumes  the estimated bi volume is further validated by microseismic data   the target formation in this study is the lower barnett shale (figure 1), which was deposited in the mississippian period and dominated by silica-rich mudstones  the shale formation is bonded by forestburg limestone and viola limestone, which are considered as fracture barriers when doing hydraulic fracturing in the shale formations   perez and marfurt (2014) present a workflow to estimate bi from crossplotting lambda-rho and mu-rho, which can be derived from seismic prestack simultaneous inversion  though easy to implement, such crossplot may not sufficiently recover the highly nonlinear relation between mineralogy derived bi and seismic derived elastic properties  this motivates the authors to deploy nonlinear machine learning techniques which provides the ability to analyze data in a higher dimensional space (i e  analyzing multiple types of data simultaneously), to discover the relation between rock frackability and seismic measurements | 
2015-5925231 	 reservoir characterization for improved fracture modeling and microseismic prediction |summary  accurate reservoir characterization is an important factor to constrain a three dimensional geomechanical model for simulation of hydraulic fracturing and prediction of the microseismic response  inversions on 3d seismic data can be used to image local heterogeneities in the stress field, elastic modulus, and variations in the discrete fracture network which will have a profound effect on the temporal and spatial complexity of the hydraulic fracture treatment  once calibrated, a geomechanical fracture network model constrained by seismic attributes can be used to optimize various well, completion and stimulation scenarios  using a published reservoir characterization case study as an input to a geomechanical model, a number of scenarios are investigated including: landing point locations for optimal reservoir contact, well geometry and the estimation of fracture propagation along with its corresponding microseismicity  these geomechanical models can be used as a predictive engineering tool leveraging reservoir characterization data for improved hydraulic fracture effectiveness, hence extending the value of the 3d seismic data for unconventional reservoirs    introduction  unconventional reservoir development typically utilizes multiple, evenly spaced, parallel wells with identical engineering plans of uniformly spaced hydraulic fracture stages  however, 3d seismic often shows significant reservoir heterogeneity, including geohazards and variations in rock properties and stratigraphy  microseismic imaging of hydraulic fractures also often shows significant variation in the hydraulic fracture geometry  ultimate production and recovery rates from apparently similarly engineered wells can also be dramatically different, suggesting that the common engineering practice of standardized design is poorly suited to the geological heterogeneity of unconventional reservoirs  potentially better reservoir characterization can be used to tailor the engineering design to local conditions   gray et al , (2012), analyze 3d seismic data to estimate geomechanical and stress parameters within a reservoir, and describe the application of reservoir characterization for improvement in decisions of drilling wells and hydraulic fracture stimulation  this pioneering work transforms 3d seismic into engineering input parameters such as mechanical properties, stresses and associated fracture breakdown pressures to qualitatively interpret the expected hydraulic fracture variability  in order to transform such reservoir characterization information into a complete engineering tool, a method is required to quantitatively predict the hydraulic fracture variation within this reservoir heterogeneity framework  a geomechanical simulation of hydraulic fracture networks is a way of integrating discrete fracture networks, reservoir elastic and stress properties from 3d seismic to model expected hydraulic fracture characteristics and ultimately predict the expected microseismic response  the geomechanical modeling to follow can reconcile the geological model with engineering injection data and microseismicity for a unified interpretation of the hydraulic fracture  | 
2015-5926686 	 stress field orientation inverted from source mechanisms of microseismic events induced by hydraulic fracturing and geomechanical interpretation |summary  we present results of application of stress field inversion on microseismic monitoring data  we inverted regional principal stress directions from the source mechanisms of microseismic events induced by hydraulic fracturing in a shale reservoir  we compare results of stress inversion from several groups of microseismic events and inversions  we compare inversions using source mechanisms inverted from manually picked amplitudes and automatically inverted source mechanisms  we show changes in the stress field orientation based on subset of dataset created according to observed type of source mechanisms and depth of microseismic events  the resulting stress fields are stable, highly similar and consistent with regional stress field  we get maximum regional stress in the vertical direction, which is typical for most of sedimentary basins, and maximum horizontal stress oriented approximately 75° from the direction of the drilled wells  the fact that we obtained the regional stress indicates that the regional stress determined the source mechanisms of induced microseismic events and we use mohr diagrams to determine most likely fault planes of these events |introduction  microseismic monitoring is considered to be a crucial tool for observing and mapping reservoir response to hydraulic fracture stimulation  locations of microseismic events determine basic information about fracture geometry such as direction of fracture propagation, its length and height  recently, an advanced fracture characterization using source mechanisms of induced microseismic events is also routinely provided (baig and urbancic, 2010)  locations and source mechanisms allow other advanced characterization such as discrete fracture network (williams-strout et al , 2010) and stress orientation   observed mechanisms are dominated by shearing (stanek and eisner, 2013; rutledge et al  2013)  each source mechanism of a shear event represents an (micro)earthquake with two potential fault planes and slip on these planes  according to a type of stress regime in the source area we observe different types of source mechanisms (anderson, 1942) radiating specific directional dependent pattern of seismic waves (aki & richards, 1980)  we use the waveforms of seismic waves to determine source mechanisms  the source mechanisms enable us to invert the most suitable stress field orientation which is consistent with the slippage on the fault planes determined from source mechanisms | 
2015-5928833 	 coupled geomechanics and fluid flow model for production optimization in naturally fractured shale reservoirs |summary  the benefits of hydraulic fracturing horizontal wells in unconventional reservoirs for production enhancement are evident; however, the best methods to truly increase recovery efficiency through these stimulations are still under great examination  analogous to how operators and service companies discovered that barnett-style slickwater treatments were not successful in all reservoirs, companies are beginning to recognize the importance of engineered stimulations, specifically in regard to geomechanics  rather than perforating for only production purposes, hydraulic fracturing design has now turned its focus to perforating for reservoir rock stimulation  enhanced fracture network complexity through induced fractures greatly increases the contact area and reservoir drainage for maximum productivity  however, to accomplish the stimulation of both primary and secondary fracture networks, the coupled behaviors of geomechanics and fluid flow in response to the hydraulic fracturing operations must be considered  this paper details the development of a coupled geomechanics and fluid flow model for the purpose of hydraulic fracture design optimization through the evaluation of different stimulation patterns  the patterns under consideration include the zipper, texas two-step, and modified zipper designs  furthermore within these patterns, the well locations and hydraulic fracture properties are analyzed to determine the most ideal design for a shale oil reservoir based on recovery efficiency and generated fracture complexity   as a result of this study, it was found that with the staggered fracture placement offered by the modified zipper pattern, a highly conductive secondary complex fracture network is generated allowing for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery  in comparison to the zipper and texas two-step patterns, the modified zipper pattern reduces the stress anisotropy within the formation to a much greater extent, aiding in the fracture generation process to increase the flow area  this advantage coupled with its high oil recovery factor and potential for greater drilling density discerns the modified zipper as the ideal pattern for the development of an eagle ford-type shale oil reservoir  | 
2015-593 	 study on the rheological properties of the surrounding rock of a deep buried phyllite tunnel |abstract  the creep deformation of surrounding rock masses is a commonly encountered geological hazard that presents significnat harm to deep buried soft rock tunnels  creep deformation frequently occurs during the operation periods of tunnels  in this study, the long-term rheological properties of the surrounding rock in a lanjiayan deep buried phyllite tunnel were investigated  a rheological model and the rheological parameters of the tunnel were established based on the results of a triaxial creep laboratory test  the theoretical curves obtained from the proposed rheological model corresponded with the test curves  the variation laws of the plastic zone and deformation in the secondary lining over time were also investigated  furthermore, the cross sectional shape of the tunnel boundary and thickness of the deformation layer were optimized  1  introduction|phyllite is a phyllitic-structured type of low grade metamorphic rock  phyllite softens easily in water and has a uniaxial compressive strength that decreases significantly in a water-saturated state  the saturated uniaxial compressive strength of phyllite (<25 mpa) can be reduced to <u+00bd> ~ 1/3 of its original strength [1]  according to the standard for the engineering classification of rock masses [2] and the code for the investigation of geotechnical engineering [3], phyllite is a soft rock  engineering practice shows that, after the excavation and supporting of a deep soft rock tunnel, the deformation of its surrounding rock undergoes increasing amounts of rheological processes over time  after a certain period of time, large amounts of deformation occur, which can lead to the failure of supporting structures  thus, the rheological properties of the surrounding rock of tunnels have been studied frequently  d  sterpi and g  gioda [4] used plastic, viscoelastic and viscoplastic elastic and rheological models to simulate the three stages of the creep behavior of rocks subjected to the high amounts of geostress in a deep tunnel  d  debernardi and g  barla [5] proposed a new viscoplastic constitutive model to describe the mechanical properties of the surrounding rock stratum of a large extrusion tunnel, while considering both the elastoplastic and viscoplastic properties of the tunnel  a  fahimifar [6] deduced the analytical solutions for circular tunnel deformation under hydrostatic pressure and predicted the displacement of a wall over time by assuming that the surrounding rock consisted of incompressible burgers viscoelastic materials  p  nomikos [7] studied the stress and displacement characteristics of the surrounding rock of a tunnel using an axisymmetric burgers model and analyzed the effects of the viscoelastic parameters and rheological properties of the surrounding rock on those characteristics | 
2015-5930587 	 a first-arrival wavelet based rotation strategy for 3d-3c data: a case study from rock springs uplift, wyoming |summary  data rotation from the field coordinate system (parallel and perpendicular to the receiver lines) to the natural coordinate system (axes of maximum and minimum shear-wave amplitudes) is a critical step in multicomponent processing  at present, there is a general lack of rotation methods that are free of interpretation or picking biases  this study presents a rotation method that is based on construction of hodograph from first arrival wavelets of the two mutually perpendicular horizontal component geophones  ease of identification of the first-arrival wavelets reduces the bias in hodograph construction and, in turn, the interpretation of the natural coordinate system  the proposed methodology is applied to a 3d-3c dataset from rock springs uplift, wyoming, usa, which is a high priority co2 sequestration site  the natural coordinate system independently established by hodographs of four source-receiver pairs spread across the survey, indicating that the regional fracture trend is 26 60± 5°nne  the results are also supported by the field geology, strongly suggesting first arrival hodograph construction as a viable means for data rotation in multicomponent processing  |introduction  in multicomponent acquisition, particle motion is simultaneously recorded along the three principle axes  the benefit of such a recording is the possibility of reconstruction of the full wavefield, which is always more effective in delineating the subsurface rock properties than single component data  multicomponent processing requires a more holistic approach than their p-wave counterparts  for every shot-receiver pair in a multicomponent survey, a coordinate system can be imagined where one axis radially point away from the shot  when the 3c data are being recorded in a homogeneous isotropic subsurface, the radial horizontal component phone will record the maximum s-wave amplitude  naturally, the transverse horizontal component phone will record the minimum s-wave amplitude  in the presence of anisotropic sources such as fractures, polarized stress fields and preferentially oriented grains or their combinations, the subsurface becomes birefringent and splits the shear wave into a fast and a slow phase  the plane of maximum s-wave amplitude does not remain radial to the source anymore  the two mutually perpendicular s-wave polarization planes set the natural coordinate system of the survey area  determining the natural coordinate system can become important, for example, when a reservoir has fracture-induced anisotropy (thomsen, 1988) and or shot orientation needs to be defined in hydraulic fracturing (zoback, 2010), or in carbon dioxide (co2) sequestered studies, where the natural coordinate systems may correspond to the directions of the maximum and minimum in-situ stress fields in the overlying seals | 
2015-597 	 loading rate dependency of dynamic fracture toughness of rocks |abstract  in this study, straight notched disk bending (sndb) specimens of yeongju granite were used to determine the fracture toughness with wide range of loading velocity from 0 01 to 680,000 mm/min  the sndb specimens were dynamically loaded with the split hopkinson pressure bar (shpb) system  static fracture toughness values of the granites were also determined to compare with the dynamic fracture toughness  the measured fracture toughnesses kic under the static and dynamic loading condition were plotted against the loading rate v on a logarithmic graph  the crack opening behavior around the tip of the notch during dynamic loading was observed by using a high speed digital camera  the fracture planes around the notch tip inside the tested samples were observed by a high-resolution microfocus x-ray ct scanner   1  introduction  fracture toughness is an indication of the amount of stress required to propagate a preexisting crack and is one of the most important properties of any material for many design applications such as rock drill bit, rock crushing and hydraulic fracturing in a wellbore[1]  it is well known that the fracture toughness of rocks is dependent on the material properties and the surrounding environment condition such as loading rates, temperature etc [1]  many researchers reported that fracture toughness increased with increasing the loading rate[2,3]  it is still a great issue that why rock materials show strong loading rate/strain rate dependency of fracture toughness and strength   in this study, the straight notched disk bend (sndb) method was adopted to measure static and dynamic fracture toughness of granite  the sndb samples were loaded under different loading rates using mts machine and split hopkinson pressure bar (shpb) system  high speed digital camera system was used to observe the fracture behavior at the tip of the notch of sndb samples during dynamic impact loads  the fracture planes around the notch tip of the tested samples were observed by microfocus x-ray ct scanner  | 
2015-598 	 experimental and numerical investitaions on mixed mode fracturing of concrete and rocks by using semi-circular disc (scd) and disc specimens |abstract|sudden and violent fracturing of brittle materials, such as natural-forming rocks and artificial aggregates like concretes, still remain one of the leading causes of fatalities in mining, civil and geotechnical industries today  the primary aim of this research work is to investigate the mixed modes i (tensile) and ii (shearing) fracturing mechanisms of brisbane tuff rock and prepared concrete samples using semi-circular disc (scd) and cracked chevron-notched brazilian disk (ccnbd) specimen geometries  in order to create various mixed mode loading conditions, the chevron notch cracks of the ccnbd specimens were oriented at notch crack inclination angles, <u+00df>, of 0°:, 30°:, 45°:, and 70°: as part of the diametral testing procedure, whilst the scb specimens were cut at the same <u+03b2>s prior to conducting the three-point bending tests  the experimental study revealed that the ccnbd geometry and the brisbane tuff rock have higher failure loads than the scd geometry and concrete sample counterparts  following the experiments, a series of numerical analyses were then performed using franc2d software to simulate the stress distributions and fracturing behaviour of the samples at different <u+03b2> values  overall, this investigation showed <u+03b2>, and hence the mixed mode loading condition, is a function of failure load, stress distributions, position of the pre-existing cracks relative to the major principal stress and fracturing behaviour of brittle materials   1  introduction and background |engineering rock structures are primarily designed to withstand the loads they are expected to be subjected to whilst in service (ceriolo and di tommaso, 1998)  however, majority of mining, civil, and geotechnical large-scale structures are comprised of brittle materials (e g  natural-forming rocks, construction aggregates, etc ) containing multiple inherent cracks and/or discontinuities that provide favourable paths for crack propagations (chong and kurrupu, 2012)  hence, when such rock mass structures are subjected to complex loading conditions, an abrupt and violent release of material’s stored elastic strain energy caused by rapid crack propagation is highly inevitable (hoek, 1968)  as a result, the mining, civil and geotechnical industries are persistently susceptible to significant safety hazards, material damage, and interruption or even cession of engineering operations (szwedzicki, 2003)  | 
2015-607 	 the fully coupled fluid flow and geo-mechanics model for simulating simultaneous multiple hydraulic fractures propagation in horizontal wells |abstract  in order to reveal the stress shadow effect and its influencing factors in the processing of segregated fracturing in horizontal wells, this paper provides a novel fracture propagation model to simulate multiple hydraulic fracture propagation from a horizontal wellbore  the model couples fracture deformation with fluid flow in the fractures and the horizontal wellbore, includes frictional pressure drop, perforation limited entry, and flow distribution for each fracture  the finite difference method and the finite element method are respectively adopted to simulate fluid flow in fractures and the rock deformation  meanwhile, picard iteration method is used to solve the coupled model  the calculation results show that stress shadow do exist, which affects the deformation and propagation of cracks  because the internal perforation clusters are strongly compressed by the both lateral cracks, the internal crack growth is restrained and the fracture length and width are both small  the intensity of the stress shadow is closely related to perforating cluster spacing, the elastic modulus of rock and so on  the greater the elastic modulus of rock and the smaller the perforating cluster spacing are, the more obvious the interference between the fractures is  under the same condition, the stress shadow interference between clusters can be alleviated and the extension of the main fracture can also be promoted by injecting low-viscosity fracturing fluids at large flow rate    1  introduction  horizontal well staged fracturing is one of the key technologies for the development of shale gas, tight gas and other unconventional reservoirs  mainly through the applications of the staged perforating technology, low viscosity fracturing fluid and steering materials, multiple branch fractures are induced while the main fracture is propagating, which connects the natural fractures  hence, complex fracture networks occur, which improve the flow channels and then the ultimate recovery of oil and gas  in recent years, with the continuous improvement of composite bridge plug + multi-cluster perforation staged fracturing process, the scale and number of segments of reservoir reconstruction are increasingly large  however, the existing mine practice shows that the small cluster spacing will lead to a considerable number of clusters that are unable to form an effective crack [1]  the presence of these invalid cracks not only dramatically reduce the efficiency of fracturing, but also result in high operation pressure, sand plugging and other engineering problems, which sometimes can even cause failure of the entire fracturing operation  currently, the optimization problems of segments within the cluster spacing have been studied by some scholars  but these researches are mainly focused on the relationship between the cluster spacing and the optimization of production capacity | 
2015-610 	 attenuation of seismic waves in brine-saturated hawkesbury sandstone: an experimental study |abstract  the attenuation characteristics of compressional (p) and shear (s) waves in dry water, and varyingly saturated brine (10, 20 and 30% nacl by weight) saturated hawkesbury sandstone samples were measured in the laboratory within the ultrasonic frequency range of 0 1-1 5mhz  the results were analyzed using the pulse transmission technique and spectral ratios were used to calculate the attenuation coefficient and quality factor (q)  the values were calculated relative to a reference sample of aluminium with negligible attenuation, and the effect of salinity on the attenuation characteristics of sandstone was evaluated  velocity dispersion was observed for both p and s waves for all the tested conditions  it is observed that the attenuation coefficient is frequency-dependent, and the attenuation coefficient of the tested sandstone is linearly proportional to frequency for both p and s waves  interestingly, with respect to dry value, the attenuation coefficient increases with the fluid saturation (both water and brine)  moreover, the calculated q values reveal that the values are highly dependent on saturation condition, and reduce with saturation  varyingly saturated brine (10, 20 and 30% of nacl) was then used to simulate the brine saturation effect  according to the results, although the sample saturated with 10% nacl had similar attenuation characteristics to the water-saturated sample, 20 and 30% nacl saturated samples displayed considerable variations in attenuation coefficient and quality factor, where the attenuation coefficient decreases with increasing salinity level of the pore fluid and consequently, the quality factor of the rock formation is also increased    1  introduction  carbon capture and storage (ccs) in geological reservoirs is one of the best ways to reduce anthropogenic co2 emission into the atmosphere  it is now well accepted that co2 geo-sequestration in deep saline aquifers can accommodate large amounts of captured anthropogenic co2 compared to other geological reservoirs [1, 2] such as depleted oil/gas and coal formations  generally, the most preferable saline aquifers are of sandstone and most are highly saline [3]  during long-term injection in co2 sequestration, the reservoir undergoes different mineralogical reactions, including the dissolution and precipitation of rock minerals, which in turn alter the hydro-mechanical properties of the formation  therefore, it is essential to evaluate the possible changes in the hydro-mechanical properties of undisturbed formations before initiating the injection process  | 
2015-612 	 development of experimental apparatus for real-time observation of hydraulic fracture in unconsolidated sands by x-ray ct method |abstract  in order to clarify the characteristics of hydraulic fracture in unconsolidated sands, we have been developing laboratory experimental apparatus to observe the hydraulic fracture behavior by the x-ray ct method  the apparatus should be designed satisfying conditions such as (i) specimens have a size to be sufficiently large for the fracture growth, i e  more than few hundreds mm, (ii) the inside of such a large specimen is visualized within a time interval to be sufficiently short compared with a time period of few hundreds seconds required for fracture initiation and growth, and (iii) the specimen is subjected to tri-axial compression for simulating subsurface conditions  considering those requirements, we developed several types of experimental apparatus, and finally succeeded to develop an apparatus which allows us to obtain within an interval of few seconds a ct image of a longitudinal slice of the fracture along the growing direction  the results clearly show characteristic behaviors of hydraulic fracture  for example, the fracturing fluid reached the fracture tip and invaded farther into the rock matrix; therefore, a non-wetted zone did not develop at the fracture tip, in contrast to that observed in hard rocks    1  introduction|in recent petroleum engineering, hydraulic fracturing techniques are applied not only to brittle formations but also to unconsolidated one for enhancement of production  the unconsolidated sands have properties of rather higher permeability more than 10 md and fairly weaker bond between particles compared with hard rocks  for those reasons, fracturing behavior in unconsolidated sands is not suitably represented by existing models for brittle, linear-elastic rocks  thus we have been trying to clarify the fundamental mechanism of hydraulic fracturing in unconsolidated formations by laboratory experiments [1-4] and numerical simulations based on the discrete element method [5, 6]  as one of those studies, we have been developing laboratory experimental apparatus to observe the hydraulic fracture behavior by the x-ray ct method  in this study, big improvements have been made recently, and it allows to have ct images of a longitudinal slice of hydraulically induced fracture along the growing direction within an interval of few seconds  this paper will summarize new findings obtained by using the apparatus  | 
2015-613 	 numerical simulation of the shear behaviors of rock joints under the direct shear test |abstract  this paper employs the particle flow code in 2 dimensions (pfc2d) to simulate the shear behaviors of rock joints under direct shear tests  a series of rock joints and regular joints with various saw-tooth angles are investigated  the shear resistance - shear displacement relationship, shear strength parameters, crack propagation, and failure modes are observed and investigated  based on the numerical simulation results and application of the regular joint models, the simulation results compared well with the shear strength models of patton [3] and zhang [4] for higher and lower normal stresses but only compared well with the model of zhang [4] for critical normal stresses  for observation of crack propagation, the initial micro-cracks appeared near the saw-tooth interfaces at 60% ~ 70% of the peak stress state before the peak  soon, micro-cracks began to propagate into a macro-crack until the stress state reached the peak  the simulated failure modes are compare well with zhang [4]  this paper further established the chart of the distribution of failure modes based on the saw-tooth angle and the normal stress conditions   1  introduction  rocks usually accompany inherent discontinuities, including joints, cleavage, and foliation, which were occasioned by tectonic stresses and pressure release  for engineering activities of tunnel excavation and slope stability, a rock joint is one of key components that could lead to tunnel collapse or slope failures during construction  several factors could influence the mechanical behaviors of a rock joint, i e , roughness, persistence, wall strength, aperture, and spacing, of which roughness is one of the most important factors for rock sliding   the natural rock joint geometry never follows a specific regular pattern  hence, most of the shear strength criteria of a rock joint have been developed by empirical analysis [1-2]  several scholars simplified the rock joint geometry as a saw-tooth shape and established analytical solutions by observing the results of experimental tests [3-4]  although shear strength criteria can be developed by experimental tests, the sliding failure process is still difficult to observe  numerical simulation is one of approaches that can help to understand the failure mechanism, and the use of the discrete element method (dem) is a magnificent demonstration of this capability [5-13]  to understand the relationship between the joint failure process and its shear strength, a fundamental investigation is required (a simplified joint geometry (saw-tooth), a basic sliding test (direct shear test, dst), and a 2 dimensional numerical analysis were considered)  hence, this paper used the particle flow code in 2 dimensions (pfc2d, a dem program) to simulate the mechanical behaviors of saw-tooth rock joints under the direct shear test  the shear resistance - shear displacement relation, the shear strength parameters, the crack propagation, and the failure modes will be discussed in this paper  | 
2015-614 	 variability of mechanical properties of bimrock |abstract  this paper used pfc2d to simulate bimrock mechanical behaviors under uniaxial compressive tests and presents the means and variances of uniaxial compressive strength (ucs), young’s modulus (e), and poisson’s ratios (<u+03c5>) for various volume fractions and strain gauge lengths  the results show that ucs, e, and <u+03c5> increase as vf increases, and simulated e and <u+03c5> were consistent with the differential scheme and hashin-shtrikman bounds  in quantifying the uncertainty of young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio measurements using a strain gauge, the measurement uncertainties initially increase and then decrease with increasing vf; when vf =0 3~0 4 (0 or 1), young’s modulus and poisson’s ratio reach a maximum (minimum) value  in addition, crack propagation was also observed and discussed in this paper    1  introduction  rock strength and its elastic modulus are important geotechnical engineering parameters  however, it is difficult to obtain completely mechanical behaviors if rocks belong to highly heterogeneous media, i e , melange and fault breccia, which are considered as a type of bimrock, and defined as “a mixture of rocks, composed of geotechnically significant blocks within a bonded matrix of finer texture” [1]  because bimrock has chaotic block dispersion, it is difficult to sample the representative specimen  in addition, its engineering characteristics and mechanical behaviors are more complicated than other geomaterials  volume fraction (vf) plays an important role in bimrock mechanical behaviors [2-6]   bimrock spatial variability could cause uncertainties in physical and mechanical measurements  medley [7] manufactured physical synthetic bimrocks to investigate the uncertainty of vf estimation using the scanline method  tien et al  [8-10] proposed analytical and numerical solutions for quantifying the uncertainty of vf measurements using the scanline method and a sampling window  kahraman and alber [3, 11-12] tested various sizes of fault breccia with a uniaxial compressive test; the results show that the variability of fault breccia strength decreases with increasing size  | 
2015-615 	 on the tunnelling in weak slate formations in taiwan |abstract  in the wanta-sunglin hydropower project of taiwan power company, a 5,947m-long tunnel passing through metamorphic slate formations was constructed by natm method  before the breakthrough of this tunnel in 2011, due to the variation of geological conditions, the excavation was blocked by shear zones with squeezing and creeping effects, until remedial measures and supporting adjustment were applied  beside the difficult geological conditions, part of the alignment of this tunnel underpasses the chuoshui river, which makes the support design even more challenging  this paper summaries the support designs, the tunnel deformation instrumentation, and the feedback analysis  in addition, the treatment and reinforced adjustment for the sections of river underpassing and shear zones were also illustrated and discussed  the experiences learned from this project can contribute to the other newly-built or rehabilitation hydropower projects in a similar situation   1  introduction  in order to more efficiently obtain the hydropower from the wushe reservoir, which is situated at the upstream of chuo-shuei river, taiwan power company planned and constructed the wanta-sunglin hydropower project  it comprises the extension of wanta hydropower plant and the newly built sunglin hydropower plant  in the former wanta extension project, a new intake shaft was built with a new tunnel passage to the power plant  and a long tunnel from the new sunglin weir to a new underground plant were built in the latter sunglin project  the total length of tunnels built in the wanta- sunglin project is 5947m, see figure 1  for the objectives, this hydropower project can generate green electrical power 0 125 billion kwh per year  in contrast with hydrocarbon generated power, this project can reduce the emission of co2 by 67000 tons per year  in addition, as part of the hydropower system, it can improve the operation of the water reservoirs, in which the water for irrigation and utility usages can be more flexibly supplied | 
2015-616 	 evaluating foundation-structure behavior using a jointed material model |abstract  numerical modeling is a standard tool employed on civil engineering projects to simulate complex foundation structure interaction problems, particularly those involving strong seismicity  a key to a representative model is incorporating detailed knowledge of the geologic conditions and an understanding of potential failure modes  during excavation of the stilling basin at the neelum jhelum hydroelectric project in pakistan a rock slide undermined the sedimentation basin foundation halting work in the area  a redesigned slope allowed construction to resume  most important, the post-slide evaluation identified a potential failure mode that had not previously been considered that had the potential to undermine the global stability of the foundation and structures  the ensuing finite element analyses employed jointed material properties to simulate weak discontinuities in the foundation  sensitivity analyses along with concurrent detailed mapping and monitoring during construction of the new redesigned slope provide greater confidence that global stability is satisfied for this potential failure mode   1  introduction  the neelum jhelum hydroelectric project (njhp), located near muzaffarabad in the state of azad jammu and kashmir in northeastern pakistan, is being developed by the water & power development authority (wapda) of pakistan  the project, shown on fig  1, utilizes a gross hydraulic head of about 430 m by diverting water from the neelum river with a dam and intake works at nauseri to the lower branch of the jhelum river through a 32-kmlong tunnel system and underground powerhouse complex  the installed generating capacity of the project is 968 mw   the project is divided into three construction lots: lot c2 includes the headrace tunnel; lot c3 covers the surge shaft, penstocks, powerhouse complex, and tailrace tunnel; and lot c1, which is the area of focus in this paper, includes the headworks and the initial segment of the headrace tunnel  lot c1, shown on fig  2, includes a central 56-m high concrete gravity dam with a concrete debris channel and rockfill dam section forming the right abutment  a gated spillway leads to a 100-m-long by 32- m-high stilling basin between el  986 m and its foundation near el  954 m  the dam diverts water through the intake structure and a 300-m-long by 76-m-wide sedimentation basin  the sedimentation basin is located immediately west of the stilling basin and is founded at el  986 m with walls that extend to el  1019 m  after flowing through the sedimentation basin, the water is routed to the headrace tunnel | 
2015-618 	 long-term compaction behavior of permian sandstones - an investigation into the mechanisms of subsidence in the dutch wadden sea |abstract|in this contribution, we report on the effect of production-induced reservoir compaction, using core material from a permian sandstone reservoir located at the dutch wadden sea coastline, at a depth of ~~3700 m tvdmsl  to assess the nature of the compaction mechanisms that operate in these reservoirs, and hence better constrain predictions of subsidence rate and magnitude, we have carried out more than 30 long-term pore pressure depletion tests on sub-samples taken from the extracted core material  our laboratory data show that pressure depletion results in total strain of 5·10-3 -15·10-3 over the duration of the experiment of 5-12 weeks, with approximately 80% of the total strain response being rapid, and 20% time-dependent  the response is dependent on porosity and stress state, but seems rather insensitive to temperature, and pore fluid composition  our work shows that while volumetric compaction of the sandstone reservoirs could be responsible for the magnitude of the subsidence observed in the wadden area, it cannot directly explain the observed temporal relationship between subsidence and reservoir pressure decline, or at least not without some rescaling factor  instead, other mechanisms such as salt flow or water-leg compaction should also be considered    1  introduction|though depletion-induced reservoir compaction is a well-known phenomenon in the hydrocarbon industry, the mechanisms that operate, and the coupling between pressure decline and material response may strongly vary as a function of reservoir depth, composition, basin and production history, and material properties  pressure solution creep, grain cracking, pore collapse, and shear failure are a number of possible operating mechanisms responsible for accommodating stress changes in the reservoir  in addition to these, upscaling of the response must be achieved in the lateral and stratigraphic directions, to arrive at a bulk description of the strain response, to serve as a means for bounding surface subsidence  aside from the spatial component, also the temporal aspects must be addressed  in this paper, we report an experimental program that aims at improving our understanding of the magnitudes, and rates, of reservoir compaction related to gas production from dutch wadden sea fields  we specifically report a series of triaxial strength, and long-duration uniaxial-strain pore pressure depletion (uppd) tests, that enable us to assess the constitutive response of the permian reservoir rock to production  | 
2015-619 	 dimensioning principles in potash and salt mining to achieve stability and integrity |abstract  the paper describes the principal geomechanical approaches to ensuring stability and integrity in mining salt deposits  the various dimensioning methods usually applied are subjected to a comparative analysis  geomechanical discontinuum models are identified as essential physical models for examining how the collapse of working fields in potash mining areas can occur  a visco-elasto-plastic material model with strain softening, dilatancy and creep is used to describe the time-dependent softening behaviour of the salt pillars  the pillar stability critically depends on the shear conditions of the bedding planes to the overlying and underlying beds  therefore, a shear model is introduced, describing interface properties, i e  velocity-dependent adhesive friction with shear displacement-dependent softening for the bedding planes and discontinuities in the contact zone of the pillars with the surrounding salt rocks  as an outcome, the fundamental mechanical and hydraulic conditions that lead to an integrity loss of saliferous barriers are derived  several examples of worldwide events of flooded salt mines are back-analysed with coupled hydro-mechanical calculations, demonstrating the prominent role of fluid-pressure-driven generation of hydraulic flow paths as a failure mechanism of saliferous barriers   1  introduction  for a long time, the dimensioning of underground openings in salt rocks was primarily based on mining experience  only in the last century, analytical and numerical calculation methods of geomechanics have been increasingly used  this was not least due to some catastrophic collapses of mining fields (rock bursts) with a strong mining-induced energy release [1], and the loss of potash and rock salt mines by flooding  both practical experience and geomechanical calculations are essential for an economical and sustainable salt extraction at high recovery rates and complement each other   the fundamental requirements of safe dimensioning for potash or rock salt mining are the guarantee of stability of the mining system integrity and protection of the hydraulic protection layers or geological barriers   for the collapse of mining fields insufficient pillar dimensioning and the brittle fracture behaviour of the mined rock salt played a particularly crucial role [2]  the tendency of brittle fracture decreases from carnallitite, hard salt, trona, sylvinite to rock salt  therefore, rock bursts occurred primarily in potash mines where carnallitite was mined  in sylvinite and rock salt mines few rock bursts are known worldwide, only if extremely high recovery rate and, accordingly, very slender pillars were realised  the analysis of in situ collapses provides a basis to check dimensioning approaches and to derive empirical relationships for the necessary ratio of pillar width to pillar height (slenderness ratio), which is required ensure the viability and stability of pillars in salt rocks  | 
2015-623 	 relationship between compressive strength and index properties of rock |abstract  the uniaxial compressive strength data is used in the mine design to develop input parameters for rock mass classification  the purpose of this study is to develop a correlation between the compressive strength and other index tests for various rock units for a proposed mine  the various index tests were performed to develop the compressive strength value to be used in the design of the mine during prefeasibility-level study  the point load tests (plt), schmidt hammer tests (sht) and density tests were also performed along with uniaxial compressive strength tests (ucs) in order to develop a correlation among the compressive strength and index tests  about 700 point load tests, 155 schimdt hammer tests and 70 uniaxial compressive strength tests for rock cores retrieved from the investigation site were performed  the sht and density tests were performed for all rock cores that were tested for ucs  it was not possible to test the plt and ucs using the same rock core sample  the plt tests were performed using both diametral and axial test methods  the point load test data was broadly classified into two categories based on the failure surface  the intact failure strength represented the failure plane through intact rock while structural failure strength represented failure through preexisting bedding, fracture or joint plane |the rock groups at the site was broadly classified into three (3) rock group category (a-limestone, b-weak rocks and c-breccia) based on point load strength  only intact failure point load strength data was used to find the relation between plt and ucs  the point load strength for breccias was the highest while the same for weak rocks was the lowest  the mean plt is (50) values for three major rock categories limestone, weak rocks and breccias was 521 psi (pounds per square inch), 232 psi and 1334 psi respectively  the mean rebound number values for three major rock categories limestone, weak rocks and breccias was 58, 50 and 60 respectively  the relationship between plt and ucs was established by comparing the mean strength value for each rock group  there is a good relationship found between compressive strength and point load index for limestone rock group  the ratio of mean ucs to mean plt for this rock group is 24  this ratio has been presented in the literature for many rock groups  on the other hand the ucs/plt ratio was found to be 16 for weak rock and 10 for breccias  the point load strength from dimetral tests was found to be lower than axial tests  a good relationship is also found between density and ucs  this relationship is nonlinear and is better represented for breccias  the relation between hammer test and ucs is found to be nonlinear for all rock groups  the correlation between ucs and sht was not very good | 
2015-624 	 the use of multistage hydraulic fracture data to identify stress shadow effects |abstract  geomechanical modelling of stress changes during multi-stage hydraulic fracturing (mshf) can help optimize the design of hydrocarbon extraction operations in unconventional low permeability low porosity reservoirs  stress changes which occur during a single stage of mshf have been known to affect subsequent fracturing stages  if an understanding and modeling capability of the effects of induced stress changes can be achieved, optimization of hydraulic fracture operations becomes feasible  given uncertainty and limited monitoring data, calibration and history matching with reservoir models are used to help design mshf operations  data from “similar” wells to those that will be later encountered are used to create a semi-empirical “model” that may have predictive value in design, but because the basis in physics of such models is weak, their predictive capabilities rapidly disappear if conditions are significantly different from those used to develop the empirical calibration factors |this paper will examine the stress shadow effects during mshf in unconventional reservoirs and the possibility of fracture spacing optimization  the study aims to examine previous stress shadow models to identify the most commonly agreed upon effects of stress shadowing, as well as any noted differences in stress changes during different completion methods  field data is then examined to identify any of these effects, including but not limited to, increase in instantaneous shut in pressure which may indicate an increase in minimum horizontal stress, and fluctuations in treatment pressure which could show stress changes during the fracture propagation |both a complex mathematical model and a simple two dimensional model are introduced which will be used to compare efficiency and results in future studies  recommendations are made concerning simplifying assumptions when it comes to mshf and reservoir modelling in tight formations   1  introduction   massive multistage hydraulic fracturing in low permeability formations using horizontal wells has become one of the most commonly used method to extract natural gas in canada  the use of horizontal wells has improved the efficiency of resource extraction by increasing the numbering of hydraulic fracture stages within a single well along several hundred meters of a producing formation | 
2015-626 	 mapping permeability tensors in fractured geothermal reservoirs using meq data |abstract  in the stimulation of fractured geothermal reservoirs, injection wellhead pressure, flow rate and microearthquake (meq) data are crucial feedbacks recorded in order to characterize the evolution of subsurface fluid flow  however, one of the hurdles to successful egs development and operation is the lack of reliable evaluation for the initial and evolving hydraulic properties of the fractured reservoir  specific spatial conditions (e g , location and direction) of fracture permeability in the field are vital in defining reservoir response during stimulation and then production  to constrain the evolving permeability, we propose a model that maps the in-situ permeability based onto the oda crack tensor using the moment magnitude of individual meqs, assuming that the induced seismicity is controlled by the mohr-coulomb shear criterion  the meq catalog of locations, fault plane solutions, and moment magnitudes are used to estimate fracture apertures of individual events/fractures that are a dynamic function of in-situ stress, fluid pressure, shear displacement and fracture size  the corresponding in-situ 2d permeability tensors are computed and mapped at various scales within the reservoir  results suggest that the permeability magnitude largely depends on meq moment magnitude and fracture frictional properties while permeability direction is dominantly controlled by fracture orientation  however, uncertainty remains within the results, which need improvements in constraint from laboratory and in-situ fracture characterization, the quality of seismic monitoring and reliability of appropriate assumptions   1  introduction   enhanced geothermal systems (egs) are engineered reservoirs created to recover the geothermal resource from high temperature but low permeability rock formations  in general, the creation and operation of an egs project comprises two phases  in the first phase, the reservoir is stimulated to generate sufficient permeability through hydroshearing of pre-existing fractures in the reservoir [1]  during stimulation, elevated fluid pressures induce microearthquakes (meqs) by decreasing the effective normal stresses on the fracture planes  as microseismic events provide valuable feedback to the stimulation, microseismic monitoring is one of the most effective ways to characterize the underlying active processes and the evolution of permeability in the reservoir  this is accomplished through the use of moment tensors derived for the events [2]  moment tensors, in turn, may be mathematically interpreted to estimate the geometry of the fracture zone, the orientation of fracture planes and the dynamics of fracture development  in the second phase, a production well is subsequently planned and optimally accommodated according to the monitored spatial distribution of meqs in order to maximize thermal production  although there is wide agreement that microseismicity may signal the enhancement of permeability in egs reservoirs (figure 1(a)) and it has become a method to optimally locate a production well, the quantification of the assumed enhancement and the physical connections between meq data and spatial permeability distribution and evolution are not well constrained |

2015-634 	 effect of anisotropy on fracture toughness and fracturing of rocks |abstract  elastic parameters of rocks are typically used for design purposes in open pit and underground mining, underground spaces and rock-cutting projects  however, the ultimate strength of rocks is strongly influenced by their micro-fractures, preexisting cracks, and anisotropy due to inhomogeneity, discontinuities, and differing particle sizes or shapes and orientations  since the fracture behaviour of rocks is important to geotechnical engineers concerned with the design of excavations and underground spaces, it is obvious that laboratory investigations of their anisotropic parameters are necessary for safe designs  the main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of different orientations of the anisotropy of brisbane sandstone specimens subjected to diametral compressive (indirect tensile) loading that influences their fracture toughness  to obtain the fracture toughness values of anisotropic brisbane sandstone, cracked chevron notch brazilian disc (ccnbd) specimens were prepared and tested according to international society for rock mechanics (isrm) standards  the fracture toughness of brisbane sandstone was found to increase with increasing angle of anisotropy  based on the experimental results, a statistical regression analysis was conducted to obtain the optimum orientation angle to obtain the highest strength under indirect tensile loading  statistical analysis showed anisotropy orientations of 45° gave the highest fracture toughness value   1  introduction   rocks exhibit different types of anisotropy and discontinuities that affect their fracturing and strength behaviour  the anisotropy of sandstone has been recognised for about 70 years [1], and fracture propagation in sandstone and other anisotropic rocks is preferentially oriented [2]  anisotropy also plays a dominant role in determining the velocity of elastic waves in sedimentary rocks  the most critical measure of elastic wave velocity in rocks that exhibit anisotropy is the horizontal velocity [3]  the elastic wave velocity is reduced by the opening of micro-fractures, ultimately resulting in failure [4, 5] |the uniaxial compressive strengths of anisotropic rocks parallel and normal to the orientation of the anisotropy are different, and the most reliable estimates of their resistance to fracturing and their strength is obtained when rock cores are drilled normal or near-normal to the weakest plane [6]  to determine design parameters for anisotropic rocks from laboratory test results, both maximum and minimum strengths must be measured  in addition, it has been observed that the strength of rock joints, another example of rock anisotropy, are a function of the orientation of the applied loading [7]  generally, the effect of anisotropy decreases with increasing applied vertical stress on the rock joints  the roughness of the joint is another significant parameter that effects their strength | 
2015-636 	 modeling hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured reservoirs using the discontinuous deformation analysis |abstract  many natural gas reservoirs are characterized by large networks of pre-existing natural fractures  to design hydraulic fracturing treatments in these systems, models are needed that can account for the complex interaction of hydraulic fractures with natural fracture networks  this work presents a new method for modeling hydraulic fracturing in these reservoirs using an algorithm based on the discontinuous deformation analysis (dda)  to demonstrate the method’s capabilities, hydraulic fracturing is simulated in two theoretical pre-fractured reservoirs subjected to different levels of background stress  the results of this work demonstrate that principal stress will be one of the primary factors determining the direction of fracture propagation within a naturally fractured system  in addition, the orientation of the natural fracture networks will also influence the direction of fracture propagation, particularly when the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stress is minimal  finally, the results demonstrate that fluid viscosity and injection rate will have a direct impact on the extent to which fracturing fluid will invade a pre-existing network of natural fractures, but only a minimal impact on the direction taken by propagating hydraulic fractures    1  introduction   in the field, natural gas reservoirs are frequently characterized by large networks of pre-existing natural fractures  hydraulic fracturing treatments for these reservoirs are often designed using bi-wing or radial fracturing models, both of which are based on strict assumptions for the geometry of the propagating fracture [1, 2]  the presence of pre-existing natural fractures, however, can lead to the formation of complex fracture networks which are not well characterized by these models [3]  in addition, natural fractures can cause the flow and production properties of a targeted reservoir to deviate greatly from those predicted by bi-wing or radial fracture models  given the potential impact of natural fractures on hydraulic fracture propagation and reservoir production, the study of fracturing in naturally fractured reservoirs deserves further attention | 
2015-638 	 investigating block caving geomechanics using seismic space-time sequences and virtual reality scientific visualization |abstract  block caving is an underground mining method that enables profitable extraction of massive, low-grade orebodies, provided orebody geometry, size and competence (quality) favors caving  the use of the block cave mining method is increasing in popularity as it is the lowest cost underground mining method and it enables large production rates  despite the trend towards block cave mining, the method still faces several challenges  improved understanding of how a rockmass responds to caving will lead to safer, more predictable and more productive cave mining operations  combining large datasets from multiple sources with virtual reality scientific visualization (vrsv) is a viable alternative to understanding complex cave behavior without access to the cave  the block caving mining system is complex due to multiple interrelating factors and it is vital that the block cave mining system is analyzed holistically, rather than optimizing individual factors in isolation  the block cave mining system visualizer (bcmsv) software module was developed within the school of mining engineering at the university of new south wales to harness vrsv for this purpose  the back analysis of newcrest mining limited’s ridgeway deeps operation using the bcmsv enabled the phenomenon of pulses in the rate of seismic activity to be identified in the active region of cave propagation  capturing these regions with seismic space-time sequences (ssts) led to further analysis into the source mechanisms  orientation analysis of ssts damage volumes has enabled active joint sets in critical areas of cave propagation to be correlated to the ssts, suggesting that the seismicity is related to joint activity  this observation is supported by numerical modelling results and seismic property analysis  the potential exists for the location of ssts events to be used within the management cycle of a block caving operation to provide an indication of the critically stressed region of the caving column, where cave propagation is likely migrating  engineering/geology teams can also utilize the contained ssts orientation information for quickly imaging the rockmass fabric response to stress change to identify the caving mechanisms dominant within that damage volume  | 
2015-639 	 investigation into the effect of length to diameter ratio on the point load strength index of gosford sandstone |abstract  since the introduction of the point load test, size effect has been observed in the point load strength index  while considerable research has been undertaken to investigate the size effect in the point load strength index, and the general cause of size effect, there has been limited research applying size effect theories to the size effect observed in the point load strength index  this paper investigates the applicability of size effect models including sel, mfsl, brook model and ffsel to both axial and diametral point load strength indexes at varying sample length to diameter ratios  in addition, the size effect at varying length to diameter ratios of a point load strength index which incorporates the contact area between the loading pointer and the sample has also been investigated |through an experimental investigation of both axial and diametral point load tests involving 374 samples of gosford sandstone, this investigation found that the point load strength index varies increasingly with sample diameter for all investigated samples at different length to diameter ratios  the sel and mfsl size effect models best fitted to the size effect trend of gosford sandstone results obtained through axial point loading  however, when the contact area was included then the point load strength index found to increase with sample diameter for all investigated length to diameter ratios  the ffsel size effect accurately modelled the increasing trend of gosford sandstone results under both axial and diametral conditions across all length to diameter ratios    1  introduction  the point load test is widely used within geotechnical and rock engineering in the classification of rock  due to the low cost and portability of the test unit, it is commonly used within the mining industry to classify intact rock strength for use in rock mass classification systems such as the rock mass rating (rmr) or q systems [1]  knowledge of intact rock strength and the rock mass classification is a fundamental input for geotechnical design and also is a parameter for selecting mining method  accurate classification of intact rock strength is critical for the accurate classification of rock mass which is necessary for the development of safe geotechnical and mine designs   since the introduction of the point load test, a size effect has been observed in the test results where the measured rock strength varies increasingly with sample size  this effect can have a significant impact on the classification of intact rock strength  considerable research has been conducted to investigate the size effect in the point load test with previous research finding that point load results vary with sample diameter and sample length to diameter ratio [2-6]  this research has led to the introduction of sample size requirements for the point load test | 
2015-643 	 investigation of repetitive damage sections about the roadside debris flow and evaluation of efficiency of installing facilities for reducing debris flow |abstract  in korea, damage from the collapse of artificial slopes along national highways has significantly decreased due to the continuous survey and preparation of measures for the last 17 years, while casualties and property damage from the occurrence of debris flow at the valley parts of natural mountain area have rapidly increased  accordingly, the necessity of the debris flow management for natural mountain area that is similar to the artificial slope management has been suggested at a national level   in this study, specific sections vulnerable to debris flow damage were selected, and a complete enumeration survey was performed for the sections with debris flow hazards  based on this, the characteristics of the sections with debris flow hazards and the current status of actions against debris flow were examined, and an efficient installation plan for a debris flow damage prevention method that is required in the future was suggested   the results indicated that in the route 56 section where the residential density is relatively higher between the two model survey sections, facilities for debris flow damage reduction were insufficient compared to those in the route 6 section which is a mountain area  it is thought that several sites require urgent preparation of a facility for debris flow damage reduction  in addition, a numerical analysis showed that for a check dam installed as a debris flow damage prevention method, distributed installation of a number of small-scale check dam facilities within a valley part was more effective than single installation of a large-scale check dam at the lower part of a valley    1  introduction|in korea, more than 70% of the territory consists of mountain area  thus, formation of slopes depending on road construction was inevitable, and there were many unstable slopes along the roads that had been constructed during the rapid economic growth in the past  accordingly, in case of concentrated rainfall in the summer season where more than about 60% of the annual precipitation occurs, small and large rock falls and landslides have continuously occurred  however, for artificial slopes along national highways, nationwide surveys and proactive measures have been prepared at a national level for the last 17 years, and thus, casualties and property damage from the collapse of artificial slopes have significantly decreased compared to the past  | 
2015-645 	 the impacts of fracturing fluid viscosity and injection rate on the near wellbore hydraulic fracture propagation in cased perforated wellbores |abstract  in this study, hydraulic fracturing tests were conducted on 150 mm synthetic cubic samples  the borehole drilled in the center of the sample was cased and perforations were created in the samples  a true tri-axial stress cell was used to simulate real far field stress conditions  in addition, dimensional analyses were performed to correspond the results of lab experiments to field-scale operations  three different fracturing fluids with viscosities ranging from 20 to 600 pa s were used to investigate the effects of varying fracturing fluid viscosities and fluid injection rates on fracturing mechanism  the results indicated that by increasing the fracturing fluid viscosity and fluid injection rates, the fracturing energy rises, and consequently the fracturing pressures will increase  however, as the fracturing energy is transferred to the sample at a faster rate, the fracturing power increases, and accordingly the fracture initiation angle rises; this would lead to more curved fracture planes  it was evident that fractures would reorient perpendicular to the minimum principal stress direction despite the angle of initiation  furthermore, it was observed that the presence of casing in the wellbore would influence the stress distribution around the casing in such a way that the fracture propagation tends to deviate from the wellbore vicinity    1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is commonly used as the most viable stimulation technique in order to improve the production rate and recovery factor of the oil and gas reservoirs  when performing a hydraulic fracturing operation in a cased perforated wellbore many problems may arise  these problems lead to high frictional pressure losses near the wellbore, and consequently would result in significant increase in the operation pressures and eventually premature screen-out [1-3]  additionally, other issues such as multiple fracturing and near wellbore fracture tortuosity have been encountered during the implication of the hydraulic fracturing operation in cased perforated completions [4]  the quality of a hydraulic fracturing operation could be negatively impacted by these issues, and consequently the fracturing treatment may not improve the production of the wellbore effectively  such kind of challenges are mainly due to the existence of the perforations cavities which complicate the fracture initiation and near wellbore propagation [5, 6] | 
2015-647 	 numerical study of rock aggregate materials under various loadings |abstract  cemented and uncemented aggregate materials form the main component of road pavements, and play a key role in pavement behaviour under vehicle-induced cyclic loads  in this paper, the discrete element method (dem) was used to simulate the response of these aggregate materials under various loading conditions  initially, aggregates of five different shapes and four different sizes, assembled at a certain volume ratio, were subjected to compression tests under constant confining pressure  the results indicated that: (i) cracks initiate more easily in larger particles and in the angular rocks at sharper corners; (ii) shear cracks occur more frequently than tensile cracks; and (iii) more micro fractures are obtained with increasing the confining pressure  additionally, four different cyclic loadings were applied to a simulated flexible pavement with a cement treated base (ctb) layer to understand the impact of loading type on pavement behaviour  the results showed that: (i) settlement of the ctb layer increases significantly with increasing the stress amplitude and decreased with increasing vertical loading frequency for sinusoidal vertical loading; and (ii) more settlement occurs in the ctb layer under cyclic moving wheels carrying constant vertical loads than that caused by cyclic moving wheels carrying sinusoidal vertical loads both at the same mean stress    1  introduction  the breakage of particles relies on multiple factors; namely, particle size distribution (psd) [1], particle shape [2, 3], confining pressure [4, 5], and loading conditions [6]  laboratory observations show that the fracturing of different types of particles depends heavily on their contact with neighbouring particles [7]  this has been visualised by numerical simulations of circular particle assemblies under compression [8] and inter-particle breakage of irregular aggregate assemblies having limited and arbitrary particle sizes [9, 10]  however, to better understand particle breakage caused by particle interactions, further study on various irregular particles having specified sizes and volume ratios should be performed  | 
2015-649 	 geomechanical back analysis of measured overbreak at the crusher chamber of dacita project, el teniente mine |abstract  during the development and construction stage of the crusher chamber of dacita project at el teniente mine, instabilities such as rock fall due to the looseness of rock mass confinement took place mainly in zones with singular geometries  with the purpose of evaluating the deviations that the design implementation could have, geomechanics monitoring plan considered several topographical tri-dimensional measurements with a laser scanner, using lidar technology, obtaining as-built geometries with a millimetric precision, which were later processed in order to analyze statistical differences in time, in other words, to monitor deformation fields in large scale  this information also represented an opportunity to develop local calibrations for the tri-dimensional numerical models built on the feasibility stage  stress tensors were calculated on each point of the cloud obtained by lidar; then, results were filtered, considering all the points with lower scatter, orientations of the principal stresses and magnitudes of the mean stress, discarding points outside the preferential clusters  two different populations of data were recognized, depending on the depth of the overbreak compared to the geometry of the design  finally, results obtained from the back-analysis allowed corroborating the initial design considerations and the consolidation of the background information necessary for future requirements    1  introduction|1 1  el teniente mine overview el teniente mine is a codelco chile underground copper mine  it is located in the andes range in the central zone of chile, about 70 km sse from the capital city, santiago  el teniente is the largest known copper– molybdenum deposit in the world  it is hosted in a copper porphyry system  the main rock types include andesites, diorites and hydrothermal breccias of the miocene era  since 1906, more than 1100 million tons of ore have been mined  the mine is currently extracting around 140,000 tons/day using mechanized caving methods  advanced and post-undercut panel caving methods, variations of the standard block caving, were introduced in 1982 and 1994, respectively to exploit primary copper ore  | 
2015-650 	 rock burst of underground pillars |abstract  rock burst is the dynamic failure of rock that poses serious threat to the underground activities  this is particularly the case in deep underground mining in which high in situ stresses and brittle rocks are involved  in this paper, strain burst which a type of rock burst in which gradual accumulation of strain in a rock structure such as a pillar is the cause of dynamic failure is discussed  a steel frame structure was designed as a tool to apply the compressive load to the rock specimen in the lab  the accumulated energy in the beam is high enough to cause sudden rock failure  rock fragment velocities up to 4 m/s were measured using a high speed camera  a bonded particle-finite element model was used to simulate the rock burst testing in the lab  an approximate formulation is proposed to evaluate the induced kinetic energy due to strain bursting of a pillar  the numerical simulation results appear to support the appropriateness of the proposed formulation    1  introduction  rock burst is a spontaneous and uncontrolled failure of a brittle rock structure  as a result of rock burst in a pillar, in a very short period of time, the apparently statically deforming rock can turn into the dynamic deformation and violent failure  consequently, rock particles can be ejected with a velocity of 8 to 50 m/s [1] which can cause fatal injuries and damages to the equipment  stacey et al  [2] report that during a rock burst, the thickness of the ejected rock can be in the order of 1 meter and hence supports for the rock must be capable of absorbing the rock kinetic energy  one of the first attempts to model rock burst in a room and pillar mining system was proposed by salamon [3] who used the stiffness matrix (k) of the mining layout together with the slope matrix (a) of the complete load convergence relations of pillars to predict the stability of the rock structure  he showed that the stable situation is achieved if the system matrix k+a is positive definite  petukhov and linkov [4] considered the interaction between a linear elastic rock mass with a softening material and used some energy equations to introduce a criterion for the stability of the system  zubelewicz and mroz [5] considered rock burst phenomenon as a dynamic instability problem  in their approach, a dynamic perturbation was superimposed into the static solution of the problem and then the possibility of kinetic energy growth of the system as an indication of rock burst was investigated  lippmann [6] developed an elasto-plastic formulation to simulate the translatory rock bursting in the vicinity of tunnel faces  whyatt [7] reported on the dynamic failure in deep coal mines  in particular, he showed the growing rate of dynamic failures in mines in colorado and utah that have caused injuries or disruption of the mining activities | 
2015-651 	 extremely slow and dispersive wave propagation within a fluid-filled fracture, and its electrokinetic effects |abstract  we present theoretical models and laboratory experiments for guided wave propagation within fluid-filled, open and partially open, and proppant-filled fractures  the laboratory experiments are conducted using an analogue fracture (a “trilayer” model) consisting of a pair of slender glass plates with a water and proppant-filled gap between them  velocity and attenuation of the waves are predicted by dispersion (frequency) equations, which are derived by plane-wave analysis that employs seismic-linear-slip interface (displacement-discontinuity-boundary) conditions for modeling the low-frequency behavior of a fluid-filled fracture  the theory and the experiment are in good agreement, showing highly dispersive (i e , the velocity changes with frequency) and attenuating wave behavior  additionally, we present co-seismically induced electrical fields via the electokinetic effect within a proppant layer, and discuss their possible application for fracture characterization     1  introduction  open and partially open fractures can trap and guide seismic (pressure) waves within fluid contained in the aperture  krauklis [1] first predicted the behavior of these waves—we will call them “krauklis waves” in this paper—which are (1) highly dispersive (the velocity depends on the frequency), (2) strongly attenuating, and (3) their propagation velocity can be far below the acoustic velocity of the fluid at low frequencies (tens of m/s to a few hundred m/s, over frequencies of a few hertz up to several kilohertz)  these are essentially the characteristics of biot’s slow compressional waves in porous, fluid-saturated rock  however, for highly permeable fractures, krauklis waves should propagate for a substantial distance away from the source, which may allow us to use them for subsurface fracture detection and characterization (e g , [2])    although the theoretical models for krauklis wave propagation in an open, fluid-filled fracture have been developed by many (e g , [3][4][5]), experimental confirmations in the laboratory and in the field are still scarce  recently, hassan and nagy [6], conducting laboratory ultrasonic wave propagation tests on a fluid-filled fracture, demonstrated strong velocity dispersion of the waves guided by the fracture  nakagawa et al  [7] also conducted similar experiments at low frequencies below 1 khz, on fractures with varied mechanical compliance and permeability  (part of the results from this experiment will be reviewed in this paper )| 
2015-652 	 characteristic triaxial strength of intact rock |abstract  current limit states (or load and resistance factor) design require determination of characteristic values of geotechnical parameters as a fundamental step in the design process  unfortunately, there seems to be no consensus in the rock engineering community on the interpretation of the definition of characteristic values, with the result that there is often confusion about the method to be used to identify them  this is particularly true for the characteristic triaxial strength of intact rock  in this paper we will explore alternative possible approaches to determining the characteristic triaxial strength of intact rock  for the purpose of this analysis, two published data sets of triaxial strength are used  in our analysis we fit the hoek-brown criterion to these data, and compare alternative methods of estimating a criterion that represents characteristic strength  the methods we use are i) reducing the fitted (mean) criterion by some multiple of the standard error of the fit; and ii) using quantile regression  the results of these analyses are compared in the context of limit state design, and the appropriateness of their application discussed    1  introduction|with the introduction of limit states design (lsd), also known as load and resistance factor design (lrfd), into geotechnical engineering, designers are required to adopt new definitions of some customary design concepts  the characteristic values of resistance (strength) and actions (loads) are examples of such new definitions   current geotechnical lsd codes (e g  [1, 2]) require determination of characteristic values of geotechnical parameters as a fundamental step in the design process  although these design codes and their associated support manuals usually give general guidance on selecting characteristic values, there seems to be no consensus in the rock engineering community on the interpretation of these guidelines  an unfortunate result is that there is often confusion about the method to be used to identify characteristic values  this is particularly true for the characteristic triaxial strength of intact rock, where additional complications arise due to the phenomenon of strength being as a function of confining pressure  this seems to be a problem specific to geotechnical lsd, since the required strength property of materials involved in structural codes (e g  timber, steel or concrete) is the uniaxial strength which can be characterized with a single probabilistic distribution  in this paper we first briefly review the theoretical basis of lsd characteristic values, and then review in more detail the definition of characteristic values given in en-1997 [1]  we use two previously published triaxial strength data sets [3, 4] to explore and compare alternative approaches — namely non-linear (bayesian) regression and quantile regression — for obtaining characteristic triaxial strength curves  we conclude with observations regarding the development of characteristic curves for use in lsd, and conservative criteria for use in customary design methods | 
2015-653 	 modeling stray gas leakage from wellbores in colorado shale gas operations |abstract  the uncemented annulus of an oil and gas well is a possible pathway for migration of thermogenic methane into the shallow subsurface  poorly cemented wells allow for methane to migrate upwards from the producing formation and accumulate in the annulus between the production casing and the surrounding rock matrix  additionally, methane from intermediate formations above the target formation may also leak methane into the annulus if they are not sealed off by cement  in the united states , the annulus of the well is capped at the surface by the bradenhead valve to prevent the venting of methane to the atmosphere  however, this valve allows gas to build and increase the pressure above the fluid in the annulus  in this work, we investigate how the buildup of bradenhead pressure influences methane migration in the subsurface  we present a two-dimensional model that simulates single phase flow of dissolved methane away from the wellbore  we consider best and worst case scenarios and we vary the boundary conditions to represent both closed and open wellbores  our results show that the buildup of pressure in the annulus of a wellbore has a very small impact on methane migration  of the parameters we consider, the density of the fluid in the wellbore has the greatest influence on methane migration   1  introduction  over the last ten years, the extraction of resources from unconventional formations has fueled a significant rise in united states oil and natural gas production [1, 2]  public concern with the potential environmental impacts of the extraction process has increased as well  in particular, debates have arisen about the fate of the chemicals used in the high volume slick water hydraulic fracturing process [3]  as a result, a number of studies have begun to investigate the quality of groundwater in regions with heavy unconventional oil and gas development [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]   these studies have found varying degrees of methane in the shallow subsurface in the vicinity of oil and gas wells [4, 5, 9]  although methane itself is not hazardous to human health, unless present in explosive quantities, its isotopic signature provides insight into the origin of the gas  methane formed through intense heat and pressure (thermogenic) and methane formed by microbes (biogenic) can be distinguished from one another through analysis of the carbon and hydrogen isotopes of the methane molecules [10]  these properties make methane an attractive tracer that could indicate contamination from oil and gas drilling operations  if thermogenic methane is found in a drinking water aquifer, its presence suggests that a flaw in the oil and gas well may exist or a permeable pathway may be present between the producing formation and the shallow subsurface [4, 11]  | 
2015-657 	 impact of compression on the petro-physical and mechanical properties of wellbore cement containing salt |abstract  salt is usually added to oil well cement systems to overcome compatibility issues between well cements and salt containing formations as well as salt related durability issues with cement sheath  several studies on the impact of adding salt to oil well cement have been documented in the literature; however, the impact of compression on salt cement sheath such as during hydraulic fracturing has not been fully investigated  this study focuses on investigating the impact of compression (cement’s compaction) on the petrophysical and mechanical properties of wellbore cement containing salt and their potential impact on long term wellbore integrity issues  a unique bench-scale physical model, which utilizes expandable tubulars, was used to simulate the compaction of a previously cemented casing under field-like conditions  the impact of the compression on the cement’s petrophysical and mechanical properties were quantified by measuring the porosity, permeability and hardness of 1in x 2in cores drilled parallel to the orientation of the pipe from the compacted cement sheath  the acquired results indicate that the compaction of the cement sheath resulted in a reduction in porosity and permeability of the cement sheath and an increase in the hardness of the cement sheath after compaction  furthermore, the results confirm reduction in the detrimental effect of salt on the strength and stiffness of the cement after compaction    1  introduction  cementing forms an integral part and is often regarded as one of the most critical steps in oil well completions  it is used to fill the annulus between the casing and the formation and between two consecutive casing strings  the main objectives for cementing oil-wells are to isolate the well from its surrounding in order to prevent fluid migration, protect the casing from corrosion and provide mechanical support for the casing string  the properties of the cement slurry and its behavior depend on the components and additives of the cement slurry design [1]  as a result of the development of offshore fields and drilling activities through salt formations, seawater has become widely used for cementing purposes especially in the us gulf of mexico with well-known massive salt formations often in excess of 10, 000ft thickness [2]  there are several reasons for adding salt to oil well cement such as more desirable mechanical properties, better compatibility with salt formations and offsetting of bulk hydration shrinkage  however, salt could adversely affect admixture performance and lower the ultimate compressive strength of the cement [3]  calcium chlorides in particular, have been used to shorten cements’ setting time and calcium chloride and sodium chloride to a lesser extent have been shown to leach calcium hydroxide leading to chemical changes in the cement resulting in loss of strength and corrosion of the casing [4]  the presence of salt in oil well cements presents a danger to the cement  although the exact mechanism of salt damage to oil well cement have not been fully understood, it has been shown that salt, which is a mild acid, lowers the ph of the cement and attracts more water into the pore structure of the cement leaving room for expansion leading to fracture initiation and propagation [4]  | 
2015-658 	 mechanisms of egs creation at the geysers (california) revealed by seismic tomography, spatiotemporal evolution of the microseismic events and geomechanical simulations |abstract  the northwest geysers egs demonstration project started in 2011 at the geysers (california)  the goal was to create an egs by injecting cool water at relatively low pressure into a known high temperature reservoir located deep down below the conventional geothermal steam reservoir  here, we present (1) tomography images of the seismic velocity (vp, vs) and attenuation (qp, qs) built from microseismic data recorded before injection and during the first 60 days of injection, (2) the spatiotemporal distribution of the microseismicity over 270 days of injection, and (3) a 3d thermo-hydro-mechanical modeling of the egs  the results show the development of a seismically quiet domain around the injection well surrounded by a seismically active domain  the modeling with comparison to field data indicates that the seismically quite (aseismic) domain is due to the presence of the injected cold water  thermal processes cause a cooling-stress reduction preventing shear reactivation  this process is accompanied by aseismic plastic shear strain, which can be interpreted as slow slip events  in the seismic domain, microseismicity is caused by the reactivation of the preexisting fractures due to injection-induced pressure increases in steam pressure    1  introduction  injecting fluid into a rock formation reduces the effective stress and can lead to brittle failure [1]  such fracture reactivation can be accompanied by microseismic events due to the release of preexisting tectonic stresses  the monitoring of microseismic activity can provide valuable information concerning the response of the reservoir to water injection  the occurrence of microseismicity at a point remote from the injection interval indicates that the point has a hydraulic connection to the borehole interval  however, it does not necessarily mean that significant fluid flow occurs along the connection [2]  moreover, during the reservoir stimulation, aseismic deformations can play an important role on the reservoir development during hydraulic stimulation [3]    in this paper, we present data collected during the northwest geysers egs demonstration project [4,5]  the project aims to develop an egs by directly and systematically injecting cool water at relatively low pressure into a vapor-dominated geothermal reservoir with temperatures up to 400 °c  we focus our study on the relationship between the formation of the liquid saturated zone and the distribution of the seismic and aseismic deformations  first, we present the northwest geysers egs demonstration project, a 3-d seismic tomography performed during the first months of injection and the microseismic activity by using the seismicity-based reservoir characterization approach [6, 7]  finally, we discuss our observations with the results of a 3-d thermo-hydro-mechanical (thm) numerical model simulation of the egs area  | 
2015-662 	 proppant transport at the fracture scale: simulation and experiment |abstract  laboratory and field studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between the volume of proppant deployed in hydraulic fracturing operations and subsequent reservoir productivity  in recent years, the desire to improve proppant performance has led to the development of new generations of exotic proppants, as well as new propping strategies  nevertheless, the factors controlling performance of even traditional proppants in real rock fractures are poorly understood  improved models are needed to help devise optimal strategies for deploying traditional and new varieties of proppant |large-scale proppant models frequently rely on empirical closure relationships to represent real-world transport behavior  however, care must be taken when applying such relationships outside their derived context  in particular, most models employ closure relationships determined for slurries where the fluid dimensions vastly exceed the particle size  this is not true for fracture flow, where wall effects alter the effective transport properties and introduce new interaction forces |this paper describes an ongoing study employing a combination of high fidelity numerical simulations and fracture-scale experiments to describe the transport properties of proppant particles in fractures  the experimental work examines proppant movement in clearplastic three-dimensional reproductions of the shale surfaces recreated using three dimensional printing  these specially tailored flow cells are used in combination with micro-capsules for improved particle tracking in dense particle packs  the same shale surfaces are also employed in high-resolution particulate flow simulations in which both the particles and interstitial fluid motion are explicitly represented  the data gathered from these experiments and simulations are used to help constrain models of settling and dispersion in particle-laden fluids within fractures   1  introduction  correct proppant placement is key to maintaining fracture permeability following hydraulic stimulation of geological resources, in particular, stimulation of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs  laboratory studies have demonstrated improvements of several orders of magnitude in the permeability of propped versus unpropped fractures [1], while analysis of production rates in the field show a strong correlation between the amount of proppant introduced and production rates observed in the field [2, 3]  nevertheless, the nature of proppant transport in natural fractures is poorly understood  completed wells, for example, can experience flowback of more than 10% of the injected proppant and proppant concentration schedules are often determined through trial and error, rather than design [4, 5, 6]  the desire to improve proppant performance has lead to the proliferation of a wide variety of propping strategies  these include the development of lower density proppants to reduce settling rates and improve transport in low viscosity fluids, and the development of strategies employing multiple modal proppant size distributions to improve propping at the fracture tip  elsewhere cyclic pumping and variable proppant concentrations are employed in an effort to create heterogeneous proppant deposition [7]  these strategies are not without risk: mixing of proppants of different size can result in a reduction in permeability; low density proppants are more susceptible to flow back and are more costly than traditional proppants; and uncertainties surrounding dispersion characteristics hinders heterogeneous proppant deployment  without accurate models of proppant transport the correct deployment and efficacy of such strategies is a matter of conjecture|

2015-666 	 innovative in situ stress testing using unconventional equipment and procedures for high-pressure hydropower tunnels |abstract  engineering for design and construction of safe and reliable high pressure water tunnel systems requires good knowledge of in situ stress conditions of the rock mass to evaluate confinement and potential for hydraulic jacking to occur  without adequate confinement, an impermeable lining system would be required, typically consisting of steel-lining  considerable importance is placed during investigations in obtaining reliable rock stress information for selection of an appropriate and safe lining system  various methods are used, including standardized hydraulic fracturing, hydraulic jacking testing, and over-coring  with each of these there are limitations in providing reliable data in a cost effective and efficient way  a modified approach to hydrojacking testing is described that has been used successfully on hydropower projects in the himalayas and andes where other more traditional methods have been unproductive  it involves use of modern water pressure test and grouting equipment, often available in-country or already under contract on a construction project  lower costs and rapidity of testing permit more data to be collected than would otherwise be achieved, resulting in significant benefits  this approach is becoming increasingly common but which possibly suffers from not being sufficiently recognized in the profession or properly standardized so as to gain universal acceptance    1  introduction  in the planning and design of a pressurized water tunnel system, it is imperative to have knowledge of the ability of a rock mass to withstand leakage of high-pressure water from waterways that are not equipped with totally impervious liners  it is well understood in our profession that all shotcrete, plain concrete, or reinforced concrete linings should be considered as pervious since they will crack due to shrinkage and the effects of internal pressure  reinforcement added to shotcrete and concrete will assist in the control and distribution of cracks but will not eliminate them  schleiss points out that when a lining is pervious, seepage will flow into the surrounding rock mass through cracks, joints, or fractures, with the result that the internal water pressure will exert a load not only on the inner surface of the lining but also within the rock mass itself [1]  as long as the natural stresses in the rock mass exceed the seepage pressures contributing to the hydraulic forces within the rock mass, the load-bearing capacity of the rock will not be exceeded  in this condition, the rock mass is said to provide adequate confinement  however, if the water pressure in a given rock fracture exceeds the existing normal stress, the fracture will dilate and the water pressure will be transmitted further into the rock mass  this failure mode, known as hydrojacking, can result in an unacceptable and uncontrolled water loss and potential for serious damage to surrounding structures, undesirable changes in the water table, or possible surface slope stability issues  | 
2015-668 	 influence of structuration on the critical state friction angle: an elastoplastic description |abstract|the existence of structuration in natural clays and shales is believed to change their stiffness, yielding, dilatancy and strength; the components that are widely accepted to unite with those of the reconstituted parent soil upon large straining  however, some experimental results show that this unification may not occur in either isotropic/one-dimensional compression characteristics and/or critical state friction angle  from the constitutive modeling point of view the former can be captured with many existing models while the latter has been barely introduced in constitutive models of natural geomaterials  based on the experimental observation on the colorado shale, the present study aims at introducing the structured critical state friction angle in the constitutive model of nakai et al (2011)  a new internal variable is introduced to capture irreversible degradation of the structured critical state line in the stress space  model simulations of lab experimental tests on colorado shale are presented in order to show the improved predictive capabilities of the new model    1  introduction|natural clays and shales generally develop a complex structure as a result of physicochemical and mechanical processes during their sedimentation and postsedimentation history  the term structure, therefore, refers innately to the combined effects of fabric and interparticle bonding caused by cementation, aging or, more generally, digenesis, [1]  however, following the suggestion of leroueil and vaughan [2] the term "structured" soil have been widely used in the literature to refer to the effects of bonding, of any origin, which upon removal by plastic straining or remolding will create the parent "destructured" soil  in this paper, terms "structuration" and "destructuration" will be used in the former and the latter sense, respectively  |as compared to that of destructured clays, the engineering behavior of structured clays have been shown to possess: 1) larger yield stresses than those merely induced by the stress history, 2) higher stiffness and shear strength although being accompanied with a bigger void ratio and 3) brittle behavior with a sudden post-peak decrease of the shear strength, e g  see [2–4]  although many experimental studies show that these characteristics gradually unite with those of the parent soil upon destructuration, e g  [2,3], some other experimental results show that this unification may not take place in one-dimensional/isotropic compression tests, depending on the predominance of the interparticle bonding and the range of applied stresses/strains, e g  see [5,6]  interestingly, this non-unification has been reported even for the friction angle at the critical state condition under which the soil is exposed to a large shearing displacement and interparticle bonds are expected to be greatly damaged; e g  see [6–8]  performing triaxial compression tests on intact, destructured and remolded samples of saint-jean- vianney clay, saihi et al [7] attributed increased critical friction angle to the degree of destructuration at the beginning of the test, i e  the more the volumetric strain during consolidation is, the less the difference between the critical structured and destructured friction angles will be  the micro-mechanical interpretation of the latter can be linked, to some extent, to the anisotropy of the bond breakage, that is, not all bonds break when the bond yield is initiated, [9]  in other words, a number of strongly cemented clusters of particles may not be destroyed even at the critical state, and hence create more irregularly shaped pseudo-particles which increase the critical friction angle | 
2015-669 	 caprock safety factor assessment of sagd projects |abstract  this paper presents a strategy where two commercial simulators: cmg-stars and flac2d are linked together and jointly executed for thermal-stress-fluid analyses during the steam-assisted gravity drainage process  these simulation results are subsequently used to compute the safety factor against tensile failure within the caprock  a novel technique is described and implemented to also compute the safety factor against shear failure  the results clearly show that the safety factors against both tensile and shear failure will decrease as the steam chambers develop within the reservoir  selection of material strength properties of the caprock is a critical factor in the defensible selection of an operating factor of safety at a given maximum steam injection pressure  injection pressures, well pair spacing and caprock thickness also have remarkable impact on caprock safety  the methodology presented in this paper can be used to rationalize tensile/shear failure factors of safety for caprock integrity and be used as a criterion for the control of steam injection pressure to prevent caprock failure and steam leakage    1  introduction  according to the alberta department of energy, there are 167 2 billion barrels of remaining established reserves in the oil sands deposits of northern alberta  approximately 80% of oil sands are recoverable through in-situ production, with only 20% recoverable by mining  recovery rate percentages vary depending on the method of extraction but over the past several decades, cyclic steam stimulation (css) and steam assisted gravity drainage (sagd) have been the commercial in situ recovery technologies of choice  for the shallower oil sands deposits (e g  depths less than 300 m), sagd methods have been the in situ recovery method of choice  for sagd recovery process, pair of vertically adjacent wells is drilled horizontally within the oil sands reservoir; the upper well serves as the steam injection well and the lower well serves as the production well  ideally, they lie directly above one another separated by approximately 5m  once heated by steam, the lower viscous bitumen flows to the production well as a result of gravity forces  | 
2015-671 	 numerical investigation of a hydraulic fracture bypassing a natural fracture in 3d |abstract  when a hydraulic fracture intersects a natural fracture in 3d space, even if the conditions for direct crossing in 2d are not met, the hydraulic fracture can still “bypass” the natural fracture by propagating through the rock medium surrounding the natural fracture  we have investigated conditions under which a hydraulic fracture intersects a smaller natural fracture oriented perpendicular to the hydraulic fracture, and find in this reduced-order geometry that if the natural fracture only covers part of the fracturable domain height and is not filled with a tough cementitious material, the result will be an intersection geometry identical to that of a direct crossing  for the scenario with tough cementitious filling and moderate rock-filling interface strength, we study the development of tensile stress in the filling by modeling a laboratory experiment and extend the model to field-scale  the results show that as long as the cementitious material is relatively thin and the interfaces between it and the rock matrix have moderate frictional strength, sufficiently high tensile stress always develops during the bypassing process to break the filling material, also creating an intersection geometry identical to direct crossing    1  introduction  natural rock formations are ubiquitously fractured, and the intersections between a propagating hydraulic fracture and natural fractures play a very important role in determining the connectivity of the stimulated fracture network  the intersecting process between a hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture has been extensively studied in the literature [1-3], and various criteria concerning whether the hydraulic fracture will cross, be arrested by, or be offset by the natural fracture have been developed  these studies were mostly carried out in the two-dimensional (2d) space  it was realized, more recently, that certain intersection modes, such as bypassing, which we describe in the next section, are unique to 3d space and inapplicable to 2d  using a fully coupled 3d model for hydraulic fracturing, the current study investigates the fundamental mechanism of bypassing and the conditions under which it takes place  | 
2015-674 	 acoustic monitoring of mineral precipitation in a fracture |abstract  compressional and shear waves propagated across single fractures are sensitive to the size and distributions of voids and contact area in a fracture  fracture geometry is often altered by geochemical reactions among pore fluids and rock  in this study, acoustic monitoring was performed while two chemical solutions were flowed into a fracture to induce chemical precipitation  mineral precipitation along the fracture plane was not uniform and significant gas bubble evolution occurred during the chemical invasion  compressional wave amplitudes were significantly affected by the size and distribution of gas bubbles  once the chemical invasion was halted, bubble formation was minimized but the redistribution of bubbles still occurred  transmitted wave amplitudes increased in regions with significant amounts of mineral precipitation  the detection of mineral precipitation within a fracture is possible but requires an understanding of the effect of each component that arises from reactive flow on acoustic signals    1  introduction  fractures in the earth’s subsurface are subjected to natural and induced physical processes that alter a fracture  for example, a change in stress on a fracture deforms the void geometry and affects the amount of contact area between the two fracture surfaces  geochemical reactions between pore fluids and the host rock also alter fracture void geometry through dissolution and mineral precipitation  the ability to detect and monitor alterations to fractures using geophysical methods requires a link between a measured geophysical response and a property (or properties) of the fracture |compressional and shear waves propagated across single fractures are sensitive to the size and distributions of voids and contact area in a fracture [1, 2]  the complexity of this fracture topology is captured by fracture specific stiffness which is an effective parameter that captures the deformed state of a fracture topology under stress [1, 3]  fracture specific stiffness increases with an increase in contact area and a decrease in fracture aperture [4-7]  normal and shear fracture specific stiffness are used in many theoretical and numerical approaches to wave propagation in fractured media to represent the complexity of fracture topology (for example see: [8-14])  from the theory for single fractures, an increase in fracture stiffness results in an increase in transmitted wave amplitude and a decrease in group time delay  few studies have examined the effect of chemical alteration of fractures on fracture stiffness and/or elastic wave transmission [15]  in this study, we examined the effect of mineral precipitation in a fracture on compressional wave transmission to determine the effect of geochemically altering fracture void geometry  | 
2015-675 	 numerical study of cracking process using a new contact model |abstract  in this paper, the three dimensional particle flow code (pfc3d) with a newly developed contact model which can properly consider the contribution of moment to contact normal and shear stresses and the condition at which the contact bond fails was used to investigate the cracking process of rocks containing single flaws and under uniaxial compression  the new contact model was first validated by using it to simulate the experimental cracking process of gypsum containing pre-existing single flaws at different inclination angles  then the influence of flaw shape (length and thickness) on the cracking process was systematically studied and the key features were identified based on the simulations  the results indicate that the first cracks (usually called primary cracks) initiate from the boundary of the pre-existing flaw and are always caused by tensile failure, and the secondary cracks first emanate from the tips of the pre-existing flaw due to shear failure and then develop to a mixed shear and tensile cracking zone    1  introduction  the initiation, propagation and coalescence of cracks dominate the deformability and strength of rock  therefore, extensive experimental and theoretical research has been conducted on the cracking process of rock  the cracking process of samples containing flaws under uniaxial compressive loading provides insightful understanding of the cracking of natural rocks and thus has been studied extensively by researchers using rocks and manmade materials  the term flaws refer to preexisting cracks or holes in the rock specimens  the results indicate that tensile wing cracks are always found to be the first cracks to initiate from the flaw boundary and continued loading leads to initiation of a secondary group of cracks that may be a combination of tensile and shear cracks  however, the types and mechanisms of the new cracks that developed after the tensile wing cracks are often hard to be categorized, and the stress field inside the specimen is never fully revealed [1]  most researchers simply describe them as secondary cracks without implying the mode of crack initiation  in this way the first cracks are commonly referred as primary cracks  so the words “primary” and “secondary” simply imply a temporal relationship | 
2015-676 	 optimizing the performance of anfis using the genetic algorithm to estimate the deformation modulus of rock mass |abstract  among the rock mass properties, deformation modulus of rock mass (em) is important for implementation and successful execution of rock engineering projects  the direct field measurements of modulus determination is costive and sometimes difficult to execute; however indirect estimation of the modulus using regression based statistical methods, artificial neural networks (ann) and fuzzy logic (fl) systems are recently employed  despite the extensive application of ann and fl in rock mass properties estimation, they are also associated with some disadvantages  in order to improve fl performance, it is possible to incorporate it to ann  therefore, adaptive neuro-fuzzy system (anfis) was presented  in this system, ann is used to learn fuzzy rules  however, some parameters of ann which are left should be optimized  as ann is structured within the anfis, finding the optimum architecture of anfis will be very time-consuming via a trial-and-error approach  this study focuses on the efficiency of the genetic algorithm (ga) to find the optimum anfis structure and its application to predict the deformation modulus of rock mass  ga is utilized to find the optimal number of membership function, the learning rates and the momentum coefficients and to select the input variables  the results are then compared with those of trial-and-error procedure  a database including 188 data sets from six dam sites in zagros mountains in iran was employed using the purpose method  it has been shown that the hybrid anfis-ga model has higher accuracy than the trial-and-error model for estimation of em    1  introduction  the deformation modulus has an important effect for designing and successful execution of rock engineering projects  the deformation modulus is the best representative parameter of the pre-failure mechanical behavior of the rock material and of a rock mass  the deformation modulus is therefore a cornerstone base of many geomechanical analyses [1]   there are several methods to determine the deformation modulus directly, including field or in situ tests  the plate jacking, plate loading, radial jacking, flat jack and cable jack are the most common in situ tests for modulus estimation  however, difficulties may be encountered during the in situ tests for example there are expensive and time consuming [2] | 
2015-679 	 numerical estimation of the strength of st  peter sandstone pillars – a case study at iowa |abstract  estimation of pillar strength is a vital part of assessing the stability of pillars used in mines  in this paper, numerical modelling using strain softening constitutive law have been employed to estimate the strength of 32 stable st  peter sandstone pillar cases  the model results show a satisfactory agreement with the general obert and duvall empirical equation  a major limitation of using obert and duvall empirical equation was revealed and a methodology was proposed to address this shortcoming  in conclusion, an empirical pillar strength equation has been proposed to evaluate the stability of st  peter sandstone pillars  the findings are expected to improve mine planning and design of room and pillar mine in st  peter sandstone formation in iowa   1  introduction  the st  peter sandstone formation has been a primary source of hydraulically fracture sand (frac sand) in the united states  hydraulically fractured sand is used to keep cracks open so that natural gas can flow freely into wells in a process called hydraulic fracturing  hydraulic fracturing technology has made extraction of unconventional oil and gas resources feasible in the united states  advances in the use of this technology has contributed to the united states, being the world’s largest producer of natural gas in recent years   the surge of hydraulically fractured sand has led to increased production capacities of mining industries exploiting st  peter sandstone deposit  currently, surface mining techniques are mostly used to extract this flat lying deposit  however, room and pillar underground mining technology has been employed under circumstances where the cost of removing the overburden cover becomes too expensive  in recent times, the use of room and pillar underground mining method is considered more sustainable over open pit surface mining method due to little environmental concerns |

2015-685 	 evaluation of conditions of rock bolts affected by corrosion using pulse echo and acoustic emission methods |abstract  the construction of some civil and mining structures requires the installation of rock bolt to strengthen, consolidate and stabilize the rock-rock, rock-concrete or concrete-concrete interfaces  in this paper, an experimental study was put on to validate non-destructive methods aiming at detecting the state of corrosion in these rock bolts in real condition  the acoustic techniques were applied on rock bolts that were embedded in concrete blocks and submitted to accelerated corrosion using the impressed current corrosion method  in fact, ultrasonic pulse echo measurements were taken every 24 hours  in addition, an acoustic emission system was attached to the corroded blocks as well as a reference block, in order to monitor the corrosion activity during the corrosion process  half-cell potential was also performed at the beginning and in the end of the corrosion process  for ultrasonic pulse echo measurements, a quantitative assessment of the energy of the echo from the walls and the end of rock bolts shows a decrease of the energy in the rock bolts when they suffer from corrosion  while the energy of the echoes stays unchanged in the absence of corrosion    1  introduction  corrosion of metallic materials in concrete and in rock is a major problem in the construction and repair industry  visual inspection of metallic systems once installed does not provide proper indications of the current problem  non-destructive methods are then very useful    hadjigeorgiou et al  studied corrosion that affects the rock bolts in mining in canada, and they recommended monitoring of the effectiveness of the rock bolts in order to evaluate their current state [1]    baxter et al [2] observed that rock bolts will inevitably be affected by corrosion, and some explanations were provided: • injecting the bolts with cement grout or resin is often not well-performed, as several voids could be observed  • bolts injected with resin usually show more signs of corrosion  • corrosion is higher near the bolt head, mainly due / to poor sealing with grout  and impact of external environment | 
2015-688 	 case study on field investigation and stability analysis of volcanic rock slopes in the southwest area of korea |abstract  volcanic activity often creates very complicated volcanic complexes due to interlayering of lava flows and volcanic ash  song-gok site, composed of volcanic rocks, collapsed at the lower part of the slope along several discontinuities around a fault  the result of kinematic analysis indicated the possibility of plane, wedge, and toppling failure in the failure section  the result of distinct element method(dem) showed that maximum displacement is 207mm and joint shear displacement is 114mm  a yield zone was verified at the fault plane of the failure section  volcanic rock slopes have unfavorable geotechnical characteristics, which is caused by differential weathering, effect of groundwater based on permeability of rocks, and systematic joints generated by cooling and contraction of lava  when considering the stability of volcanic rock slopes, data such as geological features of the rock through detailed geological survey and variations of discontinuities and rock blocks should be utilized    1  introduction  most of korea consists of mountainous topography, and thus artificial slopes have continuously been produced during the construction of infrastructures such as roads and railways  in particular, sections with a high road usage have recently increased due to the interest in new tourist attractions and changes to administrative and residential centers  accordingly, construction on existing roads is in progress throughout the country  to secure the stability of slopes produced during construction work in advance, mltm (2011) provides guidance through literature survey, topographic interpretation, geophysical exploration, geological ground survey, and various tests so that more stable slopes can be formed  however, for the new excavation or re-excavation of slopes, collapse frequently occurs during the excavation work  even though the characteristics of rocks and the direction of major discontinuities are examined through geophysical exploration or boring investigation in the initial design process, slopes that are exposed during or after actual excavation could show unexpected unstable geologic structures, or partial weak zones could be formed due to the effects of the change in the weathering condition and the difference in the groundwater conditions and seepage over time  therefore, for these slopes, the stability needs to be re-evaluated after examining the characteristics of weak zones in each section by performing a resurvey during construction and by making a detailed face map so that more stable slopes can be formed  |

2015-691 	 numerical study on the heterogeneities of rock material under brazilian test |abstract  laboratory tests show that various splitting lines along the loading direction have been observed in brazilian test  this is mainly due to the fact that the majority of rock materials are normally not homogeneous materials  in most laboratory tests, the main features of macro-fracture patterns within heterogeneous rock materials may vary from specimen to specimen owing to the differences of local heterogeneity  thus, numerical simulation is conducted to study the heterogeneities of rock material under brazilian tests in this paper  this is achieved through a well-developed distinct lattice spring model (dlsm)  one of the main features of dlsm is that it can explicitly represent the microstructure of rock materials, which enable dlsm to model mechanical fracturing problems and to study the effects of heterogeneity on rock samples under brazilian test  numerical study demonstrates that, porosity and the distribution of pores and fractures contribute to the divergence of tensile strength and the final failure mode  rock samples with lower porosities are featured with higher tensile strength and more brittle behaviors, and vice versa   1  introduction  generally, rock materials show different mechanical behaviors under compressive and tensile conditions owing to their different strength parameters: elastic compressive modulus ec and elastic tensile modulus et  the elastic compressive modulus ec can be easily obtained through conventional uniaxial compressive test, while the tensile strength of rock material is generally obtained through the indirect approach-brazilian test [1]  laboratory tests show that various splitting lines along the loading direction have been observed in brazilian tests  this is mainly due to the fact that the majority of rock materials encountered in civil and mining engineering are normally not homogeneous materials [2]  in most laboratory tests, the main features of macro-fracture patterns within heterogeneous rock materials may vary from specimen to specimen due to the differences of local heterogeneity [3]  also, it is found that the same rock material with low porosities behave more brittle than those with high porosity, being regarded as hard rock [4]  however, these experimental work normally can only demonstrate the macro-scale behaviors of heterogeneous rock  fundamentally, when a brazilian disc is loaded predominantly in compression, large compressive stresses may concentrate on the contact area between sub-grains in microscopic view  meanwhile, macro failure eventually occurs when some substantial tensile stresses are generated within the disc, and it is characterized by disc splitting along a plane/planes that parallel to the loading direction [5]  obviously, these fundamental mechanisms of splitting failure of the brazilian discs cannot be investigated well through macroscopic laboratory test | 
2015-698 	 healing of rock salt damage and applications |abstract  under high deviatoric stresses, rock salt shows shear failure, which is accompanied by microdamage  microscopically, damage results from the accumulation of microcracks, leading to mechanical softening, increased permeability and a volume increase, known as dilatancy, which is a convenient damage indicator since it is directly accessible in the laboratory  on the other hand, it is well-known that rock salt can heal itself: cracks can close due to viscous creep, and cohesion is restored by physicochemical processes on contact surfaces, such that over time, the damage induced by shear failure is completely healed in suitable stress conditions  this implies that softening, and the associated dilatancy, should decrease to zero  however, the understanding of healing processes is not yet as good as e g  of creep, both experimentally and theoretically    the ifg has developed a phenomenological approach which treats healing as a viscous two-component process, comprising a crack closure and a resealing part, such that the former dominates for large values of dilatancy with open cracks, i e  in the postfailure regime, while the latter becomes important at lower dilatancy, where new cohesion is developed on closed crack surfaces  the approach has been included in the constitutive models of the ifg, i e  the advanced strain-hardening model of gunther and salzer, the elasto-visco-plastic model of minkley and the discontinuous approach of knauth et al  it is implemented numerically in the codes udec, 3dec, flac and flac3d    in this paper we introduce the approach and implementation, and present a few simulations to validate the models  at the present stage, this should be considered a proof of principle, and further modelling and experimental efforts are certainly required   1  introduction  for the planning of the extraction of salt resources as well as for the safe long-term disposal of hazardous waste in deep salt formations, constitutive models are needed which comprehensively consider the visco-plastic deformation behaviour of rock salt  | 
2015-700 	 experimental evaluation of rock erosion in spillway channels |abstract  a series of flume experiments was performed as a part of a comprehensive study of rock erosion in spillway channels  the flume provided a controlled environment in which different flow rates and block configurations could be examined  the results of the experiments suggest that there is a strong influence of block orientation with respect to flow direction on the block erodibility threshold  similarly, increasing flow turbulence intensity and/or increasing block protrusion height were also found to significantly lower the block erodibility threshold   1  introduction  scour of rock occurs as a result of hydraulically driven removal of individual blocks (i e , plucking or quarrying)  this is a critical issue in many engineering projects, particularly for dams, bridges, and tunnels, where excessive erosion can threaten the stability of the structure  the same phenomenon accounts for geomorphic evolution of channels in hard, jointed rocks  numerous investigations from both engineering and geomorphology perspectives have examined the erosion of rock blocks subject to a variety of flow conditions including open-channels [1 – 5], hydraulic jumps [6, 7], knick-points [8], and plunging jets/plunge pools [9 – 18]  a common focus has been the evaluation of the role of discontinuities bounding the block in transmitting hydraulic pressures to the underside of the block promoting ejection from the surrounding rock mass   a lesser emphasis has been placed on the influence of the discontinuity orientations on kinematic modes of block removal  in nearly all studies, simplified rectangular or cubic block geometries were used with vertical and horizontal discontinuities thus limiting failure modes to predominantly 1d lifting or 1d sliding  for more complex block geometries, as commonly encountered in nature, the 3d orientations of the block bounding discontinuities strongly influence block removability, kinematics and stability [19]  accordingly numerous kinematic failure modes exist  these include pure translational modes (lifting, 1-plane sliding, 2-plane sliding), pure rotational modes (about a corner, about an edge) or some combination of translational and rotational modes (figure 1)  the orientation of the block with respect to the direction of loading (e g , flow direction) will determine the applicable mode of failure  from a scour perspective, this indicates the threshold for block erodibility (i e , the flow condition causing removal of the block) will vary with the direction of the hydraulic forces | 
2015-708 	 optimizing drilling parameters: a preliminary model – drilling carthage mable with oil based mud and pdc bit |abstract  this work reports a test of empirical equations for the relationship of mechanical specific energy (mse) and rate of penetration (rop) with key drilling parameters including both weight on bit (wob) and rotation rate of the drill bit per minute (rpm)  the test of the above empirical equations was performed using a new set of experimental data from drilling carthage mable with a terratek drilling simulator  the data covers the variation in the values of wob, rpm, hydraulic power, type of oilbased drilling fluids, and type of drill bit  combinations of wob and rpm values are determined within the experimental range that yields the highest rop while using the lowest mse  while showing the potential benefit of drilling parameter optimization, the results are encouraging when compared to what was achieved in drilling experiments with operating parameters that were not optimized    1  introduction  industry is significantly interested in improved drilling efficiency and reducing cost  this is particularly true when the exploration for oil and gas moves to greater depths and harsher environments  with support from u s  department of energy, terratek (now part of schlumberger) conducted a research project to investigate the effect of drilling parameters on drilling efficiency [1~3]  the research was conducted with the use of a terratek deepwell drilling simulator and a wellbore simulator  variables examined included drill bit types, drilling fluid types on selected drilling parameters, weight on bit (wob), and rotation rate of the bit (rpm)   the drilling optimization study was continued at the national energy technology laboratory (netl) with focus on the effect of both wob and rpm, since these two parameters are frequently adjusted while drilling  a set of empirical relationships was developed based on the experimental data from drilling crab orchard sandstone [4,5]  a model appeared to indicate that such an optimized condition did exist, giving rise to a higher rate of penetration (rop) with less use of mechanical specific energy (mse) where mse is the energy spent on removing a unit volume of rock mass while drilling  this work further tested the above mode for drilling carthage mable, which is another type of rock that is frequently encountered while drilling though hard formations  polycrystalline diamond compact (pdc) bit and oil based mud are used for the test as a representative of deep drilling conditions | 
2015-710 	 numerical modeling of crack propagation mechanism in jointed rock slopes using indirect bem and dem |abstract  the crack propagation process may cause connecting the main fractures and discontinuities to break away the rock slopes and produce large-scale failures in rock masses surrounding large surface mines  in this research, the pattern of cracks propagation and coalescence in jointed rock slopes under in situ stress conditions is modeled using a higher-order indirect boundary element method (known as displacement discontinuity method)  the linear elastic fracture mechanics (lefm) principles are assumed for brittle rock mass, and a mixed mode fracture criterion known as the maximum tangential stress criterion is implemented in a higher order boundary element code (programmed in mathematica) prediction of the fracture mode, crack initiation angle, cracks trajectory and cracks coalescence within the rock bridge area of rock slopes can simultaneously be accomplished via this modeling technique  in the case of crack’s conjunctions and block creation, the results obtained can effectively be coupled with the discrete element method (dem) (i e  the universal distinct element code (udec)) to predict the blocks movements and shear displacements on newly connected discontinuities (high stress concentration points or plastic zones)    1  introduction  nowadays, application of rock mechanics and fracture mechanics principles in rock slope engineering problems is an interesting subject for researchers and rock slope engineers in order to improve the methods of stability analysis and safety factor determination  for instance, the safety factor for 25 sites of small rock slopes containing single isolated crack and edge crack under mixed mode i/ii loading were computed using fracture mechanics fundamentals and limit equilibrium analysis  their results were generally in good agreement with the field observations which may be reasonable for rock slope stability analysis [1]  in the similar case, stability of a small rock slope containing single cracks was analyzed based on the fracture mechanics approach and finite element method (fem) under the effect of nonuniform stress distribution  results from scrutiny of three slopes containing single cracks in mode i, mode ii and mixed mode i/ii of loading have indicated that the stable height of a slope may be estimated given the crack length in the slope [2]  additionally, a complex procedure of arrayed discontinuities extension in a vertical slope was investigated using displacement discontinuity method (ddm) [3]  cai et al  surveyed the tensile crack propagation in vertical slopes using fem and strain energy density criterion  by so doing, the strain energy density factors were calculated in order to determine the critical heights of the slopes under the effects of tensile crack extension [4]  | 
2015-713 	 development of a geoperidynamic model for hydraulic fracture |abstract  the simulation of dynamically created fractures in porous solids is a complex problem with important practical applications in areas such as hydraulic fracturing and enhanced geothermal systems  peridynamics is a relatively recent formulation of solid mechanics which has attractive features in simulating fractures, both theoretical and in numerical implementation  the method is gridless, making the evolution of three-dimensional cracks in arbitrary topologies straightforward  to date it has been successful in simulating dynamic impact and fragmentation problems as well as in the delamination of composite materials, but its application to hydraulic fracture has not been reported  in this paper we report progress toward this goal, by elucidating a simple coupled formulation between fluid flow and fracture which may serve as a starting point for more advancedmodeling  particular attention is paid to the communication of pressure forces on the newly formed faces of the crack   1  introduction  peridynamics is a theory of continuum mechanics which has shown to be successful in applications of dynamic impact and fragmentation, as well as in delamination of composite materials [1, 2]  a basic idea of the theory is to consider pairwise interactions of material points interacting with one another over a small radius, called the horizon  the interactions can occur over several depths of neighbor particles, so the theory is termed non-local  there are no spatial gradients required in the theory, so in a fracture process the numerical behavior is stable  a drawback of original bond-based theory is that one is restricted to consider materials with a poisson ratio of <u+00bc> in three dimensions, and overall the constitutive behavior is limited (e g  not able to capture plastic flow incompressibility)  even with these issues, the basic bond-based theory of peridynamics clearly has attractive properties in application to fracture simulations (e g  more accurate crack patterns compared to other methods [2])  recently, it has been applied to geomechanics problems [3], and its momentum will surely increase  even aside from considering fractures, we find it also has well behaved numerical properties, and does not generally require special stabilization approaches like some other gridless methods, such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)  therefore, a desire tomodel dynamic crack growth in applications such as hydraulic fracturing makes peridynamics a strong candidate to consider | 
2015-714 	 development of cuttability chart for a limestone cutting with monowire cutting machine |abstract  monowire block cutting machines can be used for natural stone block squaring operations and slab cutting operations from natural stone blocks  the plants where the cutting operations are performed demand high product quality with minimum operational costs  the purpose of this study is to develop cuttability chart for burdur dark beige limestone sample based on unit wear and unit energy in monowire cutting system and also perform cutting optimization  for this purpose, the full automatically servo controlled monowire cutting system which can cut blocks in three dimensions were developed in hacettepe university mining engineering department  cutting experiments were performed at different wire rotation speed (peripheral speed) and wire downward movement speed (cutting speed) on the limestone block which is transported to the laboratory  a cuttability abacus in monowire cutting system taking into consideration the unit energy consumption during cutting operation and unit wear on diamond beads was developed with design expert 7 1 software for burdur dark beige limestone sample by using the results obtained   1  introduction  diamond wire cutting machines are indispensible machines used in several stages ranging from marble block production in natural stone quarries to the final product in processing plants  today these machines are widely used in natural stone quarries and have evolved continuously in line with the consumers’ demands so far and have opened a new era in natural stone mining [1, 2]  generally, the diamond wire cutting method is used in natural stone quarries and decorative cutting tests, cutting and lifting basic construction structures, railway bridges, old concrete chimneys and dams [3]   the process of reducing large or irregularly shaped blocks produced in natural stone quarries to commercial size or arranging randomly sized blocks into cube or rectangular parallelepiped shapes is called ‘block sizing’ or ‘squaring’  various machines are used in the squaring process on blocks taken from quarries where marble and limestone production is performed [4]  one such machine is the mono-wire block cutting machine, which is important for sizing natural stone blocks and of slabsawing from the blocks | 
2015-716 	 simple modeling of time-dependent behavior for normally consolidated soil and structured soils |abstract  simple models to describe time-dependent behavior of geomaterials in 1d and 3d stress conditions are presented  after explaining previous viscoplastic models and the problems these models contain, a new time-dependent model is presented which is formulated not using usual viscoplastic theories but utilizing the subloading surface concept by hashiguchi [1]  based on experimental results, it has been shown that the normal consolidation line (ncl) and the critical state line (csl) on the e — ln<u+03c3> plane can shift vertically depending on the strain rate  the model can describe time-dependent behaviors of both normally consolidated unstructured as well as structured soils in the same manner  to describe the behavior of structured soil, a state variable, <u+01f7>, which represents the influence of density, and another state variable, <u+03c6>, which represents the bonding effect, are introduced  after the formulation is explained in one-dimension to highlight the fundamental concepts of the model, it is extended to three-dimensions using the tij concept [2]   1  introduction  most existing viscoplastic models have been formulated based on the over-stress theory or the non-stationary flow surface theory  the over-stress type models are formulated based on the over-stress viscoplastic theory by perzyna [3] (e g , adachi and oka [4]), in which the strain rate effects are described by assuming a bingham plastic and utilizing the difference in sizes of the static yield surface related to the current plastic strains and the dynamic yield surface related to the current real stresses  however, this type of model is problematic in that the plastic strain rate is related to time alone  therefore, it is impossible to distinguish whether the stress path is in the loading region or unloading region, because of a lack of loading information  on the other hand, in the nonstationary flow surface models (e g , sekiguchi [5]), the flow surface is a function of time, stress and plastic strain, and a flow rule is assumed on this flow surface, in the same way as elastoplastic models  this type of model is also problematic in that the flow surface contains the arbitrary time variable, t, which is not objective |in the present study, a unified 1d formulation of timedependent behavior for normally consolidated unstructured soil to structured soil is presented  to describe the behavior of structured soil, a state variable <u+01f7> which represents the influence of density and another state variable <u+03c6> which represents the bonding effect are introduced | 
2015-717 	 numerical modeling technique for time dependent behavior of weak rock masses – a case study |abstract  many nevada gold deposits are found in highly fractured, faulted, and argillised host rock with rock mass rating (rmr76) mostly ranging from 10 to 50 classified as weak to very weak rock under bieniawski’s (1976) rock mass classification system  numerical modeling techniques provide a potentially useful means for evaluation of models for a number of different geological conditions, stress conditions, and support scenarios  the study focuses on application of numerical models for varying geological conditions and support scenarios for underground gold mines in nevada  time dependent numerical models are developed in 3dec and calibrated to the displacement data procured by multi-point borehole extensometer (mpbx) arrays  joints are embedded in the numerical models by creation of a discrete fracture network  parametric analysis of modeling parameters is proposed to determine confidence in these parameters at various underground locations  in the numerical models, the roof is supported by rock bolts to replicate the insitu squeezing behavior of the rock mass under stress  [2]   1  introduction  commonly, gold deposits in nevada are found in highly fractured and faulted ground  ground containing a large number of faults and fractures tends to be more susceptible to squeezing and moving  as ground squeezes and moves, safety begins to become a concern  in order to monitor this squeezing and movement of ground, multi point borehole extensometer (mpbx) arrays are commonly placed in areas of particular concern   multi point borehole extensometers are composed of six anchor points and an integrated electronic readout head  the relative displacement between these anchor points is measured and recorded to determine displacements within the drift  these displacements can then be used to model typical behavior of the drift at the mpbx location  |the discrete fracture network (dfn) approach is commonly used for joint generation in numerical models to simulate the behavior of fractured rock in an underground mine  the discrete fracture network approach is well established and used primarily in petroleum engineering for permeability and fluid flow analyses  methods by snow (1965, 1969) determined the orientation and apertures of fractures in the field  snow’s theory assumed fractures to be infinite, which would result in higher permeability values than the actual permeability of the fractured rock mass [1, 2]  parsons (1966) used a regular fracture-matrix model with any number of fracture sets for the heterogeneous fracture system [3] | 
2015-719 	 interpretations of fracture initiation and orientations in a perforated deviated well during staged fracturing |abstract  comprehensive stress analyses indicate that plastic yield, fracture initiation near or between packers or from a perforated hole are all possible during hydraulic fracturing  furthermore a fracture can be created from one of the perforated holes located in deviated wellbore subject to three in-situ stresses regime  the corresponding fracturing pressure can be determined based on the orientation of this perforated hole  while a plastic yielding process on a wellbore or perforated hole surfaces may prevent a fracture from initiating, a fracture or fractures may initiate from a near packer region or at an oriented perforation when different completion strategies utilized    1  introduction  staged fracturing strategy has been widely used in u s  and canada for low-permeability tight formations  fractures or a fracture network may be initiated from an open hole or perforations  depending on the layout of a horizontal well, the perforation orientations, clusters of perforations, and their distances to the packers in each stage, creations of fracture networks and fractures initiation are of great interests to engineers for productivity and surface control purposes  we normally calculate the tangential stresses near a wellbore or perforation for open and cased holes, respectively  whether a transverse, radial, or arbitrarily angled fracture can be generated, if a fracture can be initiated at a specific wellbore location or from one of the perforations (in the middle, at the edge of the packers or from one of multiple perforated holes) remains unanswered  these issues must be addressed by considering the critical stresses at the wellbore and perforations once we shall have a clear pictures if plastic yield occurs prior fracturing, or which perforation is oriented at an optimum position referring to the in-situ stresses, and if the near packer regions are heavily influenced by the in-situ stresses  both a 3d finite element model and an analytical poro-elastoplastic model are developed to analyze the corresponding effective stresses  these models focus on regions near the packer or the oriented perforations  they evaluate the plastic yielding and the stresses in these areas in order to determine the location and the pressure at which a fracture can be initiated or no tensile fracturing is possible at all due to plasticity | 
2015-727 	 fracture-aperture alteration induced by calcite precipitation |abstract  mineral precipitation significantly alters the transport properties of fractured rock  chemical solubility gradients that favor precipitation induce mineral growth, which decreases the local aperture and alters macro-scale flow and transport properties  we present experimental results that quantify the influence of aperture variability on the evolution of mineral growth patterns in a transparent, analog fracture  a continuous flow isco pump injected a supersaturated calcite solution, <u+03a9> = 31 6, into our analog fractures at 0 5 ml/min  light transmission techniques quantified the evolution of local transmissivity and transport  preliminary results from these experiments demonstrate that minerals preferentially precipitate in small aperture regions  this enhanced reduction of low transmissivity regions in turn catalyzes the organization of preferential flow paths, which persist despite continued mineral precipitation    1  introduction  mineralization of dissolved ions in the subsurface leads to local changes in permeability and perturbs transport characteristics  understanding the feedback between permeability reduction and transport is critical to engineered systems such as geologic storage of supercritical co2 [1, 2], enhanced soil stabilization [3, 4], and co-precipitation of heavy metals in contaminated aquifers [5, 6]  induced mineralization is commonly engineered using two approaches: (1) barrier production along a mixing interface [7,8], and (2) distributed mineralization via the injection of a solution that becomes supersaturated throughout the formation [9,10]  the gradual transition to mineralization using approach (2) results in growth structures that alter transmissivity in dramatically different ways [11, 12]  our ability to predict the outcome of induced mineralization strategies relies on our mechanistic understanding of the feedback between mineral precipitation, transmissivity reduction, and solute transport   a number of sources suggest that the distribution and extent of transmissivity reduction can be controlled using microbially induced calcite precipitation (micp) strategies [9, 13, 14]  this approach relies on coupled physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms that change local properties  in fractured rocks, micp is expected to reduce fracture aperture, but the parameters that control the temporal and spatial distribution of mineral precipitation are not well understood  | 
2015-746 	 critical pressure and scaling in cavity expansion tests |abstract  the study of fracture initiation from a cavity in rock has been largely motivated by the extraction of petroleum and natural gas from a borehole and therefore, is often considered as one of the most challenging problems in rock mechanics  an unresolved issue is relating the fracture parameters from small scale laboratory test to a large scale engineering process  to investigate fracture initiation from a borehole, cavity expansion tests were conducted in the laboratory on specimens of berea sandstone  to capture the failure process near the circular cavity, digital image correlation (dic) was used  in addition, a two dimensional bonded particle model was developed and validated  for investigating the effect of scaling on fracture parameters (e g  critical pressure), several larger specimens with different tension softening behavior were tested numerically  it was shown that size plays an important role  furthermore, using the dic measurements, it was found that fracture initiates at 80% of peak internal pressure for the rock tested   1  introduction  the expansion of a circular cavity, such as a production well in rock, has been of considerable interest for decades  however, some aspects of fracturing have not been fully addressed  for example, in the interpretation of the critical (breakdown) pressure for hydraulic fracturing, the peak of the recorded pressure data is often assumed to be associated with tensile fracture initiation  the significant non linearity in the variation of the borehole diameter with breakdown pressure suggests fracturing prior to peak [1] |in this study, using a particle tracking technique named digital image correlation (dic), a displacement discontinuity at the cavity boundary was identified  it was noticed that a fracture (process zone) develops prior to peak pressure  another important issue in the problem of borehole expansion is the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and lab/field measurements regarding a size (and rate) effect  many previous studies demonstrate that a rate effect strongly exists and that the faster the loading, the higher the breakdown pressure [2- 6]  size effect on the critical load required to initiate a tensile (mode i) fracture in a quasi-brittle material is well known [7], and therefore, understanding the mechanism associated with mode i fracture initiation from a wellbore is important  previous studies have confirmed that with increase in size, the critical pressure decreases [2, 8]  a recent study [9] demonstrated that the size effect is governed by the ratio between a material length scale and a structural length scale  the material length is defined as the square of the ratio of the fracture toughness to its tensile strength, while the structural length scale is the wellbore radius | 
2015-748 	 global sensitivity analysis of geomechanical fractured reservoir parameters |abstract  this paper presents an efficient global sensitivity approach based on the analysis of variance (anova) and the fm-ddm to assess the uncertainty of geomechanical reservoir parameters  the proposed approach was evaluated in the context of the global sensitivity analysis in a large-scale nfr subjected to injection and production operations  the geomechanical parameters were selected as the rock mechanical properties (shear modulus, poisson ratio and normal joint stiffness), and minimum far-field stresses, and the performance measures were chosen as fluid pressures in the injector and producer wells  the results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach since it allows establishing the relative contribution associated with the uncertainty of the geomechanical properties (main factors and interactions) in the variability of well performance metrics using a computationally expensive fluid flow-geomechanics numerical reservoir simulations   1  introduction  unconventional petroleum reservoirs contain vast resources to supply the energy demand in the united states  however due to their ultra-low matrix permeability, the development of such reservoirs depends mainly on the ability to transport the underground fluid to the surface through extensive natural fracture networks subjected to geoemachanical deformation of the rock and fractures  fluid injection and extraction operations are usually carried out in naturally fractured reservoirs (nfr)  the performance of this recovery process strongly depends on the flow properties of the fracture network and then controlled by geomechanical reservoir parameters, which are usually defined under uncertainty |a important step for the design and control of injection and production operations in those reservoirs is to find the relative contributions of the geomechanical parameters (e g , material properties and far-field stresses) in the variability of given performance measures (e g , bottomhole pressure) under large-scale situations |previous works have determined the effects of geomehcanical parameters in reservoirs performing a local sensitivity analysis [1-4]  on this parametric study, the individual effect of each input parameter on the output response is determined in a one-byone basis by keeping constant the values of the remaining parameters  mathematically, it can be seen as the partial derivative of that function with respect to its variables  however, the accuracy and usefulness of this approach is limited because the interaction effects when two or more parameters are changing at the same time are ignored the expansion of a circular cavity, such as a production well in rock, has been of considerable interest for decades  however, some aspects of fracturing have not been fully addressed  for example, in the interpretation of the critical (breakdown) pressure for hydraulic fracturing, the peak of the recorded pressure data is often assumed to be associated with tensile fracture initiation  the significant non linearity in the variation of the borehole diameter with breakdown pressure suggests fracturing prior to peak [1] |in this study, using a particle tracking technique named digital image correlation (dic), a displacement discontinuity at the cavity boundary was identified  it was noticed that a fracture (process zone) develops prior to peak pressure  another important issue in the problem of borehole expansion is the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and lab/field measurements regarding a size (and rate) effect  many previous studies demonstrate that a rate effect strongly exists and that the faster the loading, the higher the breakdown pressure [2- 6]  size effect on the critical load required to initiate a tensile (mode i) fracture in a quasi-brittle material is well known [7], and therefore, understanding the mechanism associated with mode i fracture initiation from a wellbore is important  previous studies have confirmed that with increase in size, the critical pressure decreases [2, 8]  a recent study [9] demonstrated that the size effect is governed by the ratio between a material length scale and a structural length scale  the material length is defined as the square of the ratio of the fracture toughness to its tensile strength, while the structural length scale is the wellbore radius | 
2015-751 	 borehole stability analysis using results from full field reservoir geomechanical simulation: a cbm case history |abstract  in this study, a hydro-geomechanical coalbed methane reservoir characterization workflow was applied to multiple multilateral wellbore stability cases from the same coalseam formation  the data from core studies and borehole geophysical logging was integrated to create a full field hydro-mechanical earth model  the models were then used for uncoupled reservoir geomechanical simulation  the uncoupled simulations results were history matched against observed gas and water production rates  the initial and evolved stress tensor from the simulation was used to provide insight into observed horizontal cbm wellbore stability issues including borehole: initial failure, fines generation, and failure during depletion   1  introduction  coalbed methane (cbm) in the western canadian basin in alberta has been identified as a major resource that can add to canada's energy economy by filling part of the gap left by declining conventional gas reserves  in alberta, the cbm industry has gone from relatively little activity prior to 2003 (less than 100 wells drilled per year), to more than 18 000 total wells as of 2012 being drilled for cbm, with some wells are comingled gas wells [1]   in the mannville coal formations, production rates in vertical wells are typically less than 3000 m3/day  however, some successful horizontal wells have gas production rates greater than 12,000 m3/day  based on historic data, economic viability of methane extraction from the mannville formation is believed to be possible only through the drilling of horizontal wells, which provide greater connectivity to the coal reservoir surface [2]  horizontal wells have been used extensively in the united states for cbm development, but transfer of technologies from the usa to the mannville formation in the western canadian basin has not been as successful as originally expected   several reasons for the limited success of horizontal wells production have been postulated, with geomechanical effects being included  the list of geomechanical effects includes: high stress fields, high stress anisotropy, weak coal, and coal natural fracture (cleat) closure | 
2015-755 	 flow of high solid volume fraction fluids through fractures and around obstructions |abstract  we present a set of experiments to investigate the development of solid volume fraction (<ed><u+00a0><u+00b5><ed><u+00bc><u+0099>) variations in the plane of a fracture in the direction perpendicular to the flow  we injected a concentrated suspension (<ed><u+00a0><u+00b5><ed><u+00bc><u+0099>=0 5) into the same parallel fracture in all the experiments, however, each experiment included one or two thin-plate obstructions at different locations and orientations within the fracture  though the development of <ed><u+00a0><u+00b5><ed><u+00bc><u+0099>-gradients in the plane of the fracture was not observed in the experimental system, we did observed a surprising transient behavior of these concentrated suspensions  a pressure transient was observed at all flow rates in all experiments and suggests that the solid volume fraction distribution across the fracture as well as the distribution in the plane of the fracture affect the pressure response to a given flow rate  this pressure transient is related to the timescale associated with a solid distribution front reaching the fracture and can have major implications when designing experiments or interpreting pressure data from field operations   1  introduction  flow of concentrated suspensions is important to a range of natural processes and engineered systems  fluids from natural hazards (i e  mud flows, avalanches, magma flows) are typically characterized by a large volume of suspended solids [1]  industrial applications where suspended-solid flow is important include hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production [2, 3], and environmental remediation [4]  the rheology, and flow behavior, of the carrier fluid is significantly different than the rheology of the suspension, which is strongly influenced by the solid volume fraction (<ed><u+00a0><u+00b5><ed><u+00bc><u+0099>)  at high shear rates, the presence of the solids typically causes shear-thinning behavior, whereas at low shear rates, a yield stress is common [5]  this is especially important in confined geometries, i e  fractures, tubes, etc , where the walls can exert large shear stresses | 
2015-763 	 simulation of a microseismic depletion delineation test |abstract  in unconventional hydrocarbon resources, the estimation of the expected ultimate recovery for individual wells and the appropriate spacing for infill drilling near existing wells both have strong economic implications  a field test called microseismic depletion delineation has previously been proposed as a method to probe the reservoir directly to determine the extent of the depleted region near horizontal wells that have been produced for a significant period of time  in this work, we performed a numerical simulation of a microseismic depletion delineation field test in order to further understand the physical mechanisms that underpin the method  the modeling framework developed herein can be used to help design field tests and interpret field observations  we observed that application of a model that coupled fluid flow, fracture mechanics, poroelasticity, and geologic structure was able to produce the physical behavior necessary to interpret observations from microseismic depletion delineation field tests    1  introduction  the successful exploitation of unconventional resources depends on the ability to develop strategic engineering designs using economic considerations as the primary drivers  in shale oil plays, like the bakken for instance, suitable wellpad geometries and well trajectories are first determined and then repeated many times in an efficient pattern in order to reduce drilling costs  similarly, hydraulic fracture treatments are commonly performed in repeatable patterns across many wells  this methodology is attractive from an economic standpoint, but given that heterogeneity exists in all reservoirs and that operational difficulties can arise, the approach may not always result in the optimal recovery for a given well  evidence from field data has indicated that productivity of individual wells, and even individual completion stages, can be highly variable [1, 2]  it is useful to develop tests that can be applied in the field in order to assess the recovery efficiency of wells and individual completion stages within each well  this information can be helpful from a reservoir management perspective, for example, in order to estimate ultimate recovery or to determine appropriate spacing for infill drilling in a given asset  | 
2015-764 	 cuttings analysis for rotary drilling penetration mechanisms and performance evaluation |abstract  drillability or drilling efficiency of rock depends on three main parameter groups: rock characteristics, drill rig parameters and operational parameters  this paper describes the methodology of rock cuttings collection, preparation and their analysis for evaluation of the drilling efficiency and the performance of a passive vibration assisted rotary drilling (pvard) tool in particular  the pvard tool utilizes rock bit interactions to create axial vibrations in order to improve rock penetration  analyses showed the correlation of such parameters as rate of penetration and weight on bit to cuttings size distribution  several parameters such as mean particle size and coarseness index were used for numerical representation of cuttings size  also a new particle size distribution bar diagram was proposed for cuttings samples comparison    1  introduction  one of the purposes of an effective drilling fluid system is to convey the cuttings from around the bit to the surface [1]   several studies have been carried out on drilling cuttings as these are commonly used for the geological description of wells  also studies on the petrophysical properties of formations, such as porosity and permeability have been conducted [2,3]  these studies have outlined the importance of cuttings analysis    however, few studies have focused on studying cuttings as a mean of understanding the cutting action of the drilling tools  by analyzing the way that the cutter affects the different drilled formations and establishing relations between drilling parameters, drilling performance and cuttings, it is more feasible to make assumptions on the rock-bit interaction models for different drilling techniques   drilling performance is often defined as the drillability of a rock, that is, how fast a certain formation can be drilled  it is characterized by the rate of penetration (rop)  the parameters that define the drillability of a rock are usually separated in three groups: rock characteristics (physical, mechanical, and micro-structural properties of the drilled formation), machine parameters (rotation, force, cuttings removal, etcetera ) and operating processes (drilling techniques, state of the equipment, etcetera ) [4] | 
2015-767 	 comparison of multistage to single stage triaxial tests |abstract  the understating of rocks mechanical properties as a function of stress is required for many geomechanics applications  one is to estimate friction angle and cohesion values to describe the shear strength vs  normal stress over the normalload range  it is facilitated in the laboratory measurement using single stage triaxial (sst) testing on multiple samples at different confining pressures  occasionally, due to limited core availability a multistage triaxial test (mst) is conducted for the same objective  the uncertainty with obtained results using the two methodologies is not well quantified due the possible changes in elastic properties while loading and unloading the axial stress  experimental results indicates the consistency of the obtained stress value at the positive point of dilatancy (ppd) during mst increases the overall results and provides an adequate correlation between the two methods  this paper describes how the data should be interpreted to minimize the error with the results obtained from mst test results  multiple rock types were evaluated representing different lithologies (shale, sandstone, and chalk) to validate a possible single correction factor from mst to sst  results appear to fit the five different rock types with and the model fits a wide range of well data from different formations, fields and basins   1  introduction|a single stage tri-axial test is commonly used to determine rock’s elastic properties such as young’s modulus, poisson’s ratio and maximum compressive strength  it is typical to repeat the measurement on multiple samples at different confining pressures for mohr-coulomb envelope analysis to estimate friction angle and cohesion parameters  measured parameters are used as an input to reservoir geo-mechanical models such as borehole stability or hydraulic fracturing  this requires a suite of four to five single stage triaxial (sst) measurements to determine failure envelope criterion  due to limited available core material on times at a specific core depth or inability to obtain multiple identical samples with similar mechanical properties, a multi stage triaxial (mst) test can be considered as an alternative to the sst  this paper proposes a technique where the “twinning” problem may be mitigated by the use of the “multi-stage” tri-axial test  the laboratory measurement and developed technique for real time calculation as a feedback to unload during the mst testing is critical to minimize any sample mechanical property alteration and provides consistent stress value for the mc analysis | 
2015-768 	 permeability variations associated with various stress state during pore pressure injection |abstract  a triaxial experimental program has been conducted to evaluate volumetric strains and permeability variations in very dense, reconstituted water wet/bitumen sand specimens for a pore pressure injection stress  the triaxial cell is housed in an environmental chamber to simulate in situ reservoir boundary conditions in terms of stress state, temperature, and pore pressure  a series of experiment were designed and executed for both isotropic or anisotropic stress states  this paper presents an improved technique and method to prepare a reliable and representative wet/oil sands specimen for reservoir geomechanical testing  the packing technique allows high quality, repeatable (porosity, relative density, and dry density), very dense sands specimen to be created  eight synthetic water wet/oil sands core specimens have been prepared with different fluid saturations  the preliminary results from three experiments show that the permeability variations are very sensitive to stress state evolution along the pore pressure injection stress path  for initial isotropic stress states, only temporary improvement on permeability was found  however, for initial anisotropic stress states, permanent deformation following pore pressure injection resulted in substantial increases the effective permeability to water and the porosity in the dilated zone    1  introduction  one enhanced sagd (steam-assisted gravity drainage) start-up scheme [1] has recently been proposed and deployed in a pilot sagd well pad to shorten sagd start-up operation time  this accelerated start-up scheme is related to pore pressure injection, which is expected to create a dilation zone vertically connecting two horizontal wells  this dilation zone is expected to increase porosity, permeability, and water mobility in the interwell region  there have been several publications on permeability variation associated with shear induced in unconsolidated sands through a series of triaxial tests [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9]    most of these studies are conducted through triaxial tests with the following stress path: maintaining confining stress while increasing axial or vertical stress to induce shearing failure  in general, such tests are designed and intended to simulate the stress variation, such as triaxial compression and radial extension, during thermal recovery process  they may not fully represent the stress path and deformation that oil sands reservoirs undergo during fluid injection  yale et al  [10] studied field oil sands samples with interbedded mudstone under fluid injection  the triaxial tests were carried out at room temperature under reservoir boundary condition with only modest levels of stress anisotropy (stress ratio 1 1) | 
2015-771 	 effect of frac fluid temperature on post gas production |abstract  the first hydraulic fracturing was implemented in conventional reservoirs  however, this technology was not applied to unconventional resources such as shale reservoirs until recently  as a result of its application, along with the advances in design of the environmentally acceptable fracturing fluid, we are witnessing a remarkable increase in production of oil and gas in us  in this work, we show our experimental and theoretical work related to heating the frac fluid by a few degrees for increasing gas production even more   to address the issue of the increased gas production from shale through shortening the post-frac shut-in time, we have studied and experimented with pierre shale in detail  in our experimental work we suspended few grams of the shale samples in heated, deionized water and measured the changes in ph, eh, (redox potential), and temperature  using a video recording system, we simultaneously recorded the process of gas bubble flow under the microscope  we plotted our 210 data points  we used the fourier transform of the raw data to construct a power spectrum which we use to extract the hidden information from frequency domain    the results are: 1  it takes a short characteristic time for the heated water molecules to saturate and activate the shale capillaries  this part of the plot of eh vs time shows that at the beginning of the experiment the capillary saturation and activation is controlled by hydraulic potential  the dominating frequency associated with this stage is the mean frequency of the whole power spectrum  at the end of the early process, a diffusive transport of the cold or heated water into the shale mass begins  this section follows the fick’s second law of diffusion  diffusion process; using heated water instead of cold water, is much faster than that of cold water, and 2  the eh show the release of the first gas bubble to be the result of hydraulic potential spearheading the rest of the process  after completion of the first stage of the process, the diffusion of the cold or heated water in the shale capillaries begins this is where the addition of a small amount of heat energy to the frac water displaces the sorbed gas from the shale macro, meso, and micro pores  interestingly, the gas production mechanism follows the predictable activation energy accurately, as described by arrhenius equations especially when combined with diffusion equation   we conclude that (a) the diffusion time and the flux rate of water molecules into the shale capillaries can be shortened by heating the fracturing fluid  we may estimate the optimal post frac shut-in time and monitor the advance of frac water displacement into the walls of the main hydraulic fracture  achieving higher gas production can be realized through faster capillary saturation/activation by heated water and (b) the desorbed gas production follows a pulsing, swarm flow, and other gas flow types |the practical application of the simple technology suggested in this paper is (1) we propose a cost effective methodology for determining the post frac optimal shut-in time which is much shorter than that of shut-in time when compared with cold water frac fluid, and (2) once this optimal shut-in time is implemented the industry may benefit from realizing quicker and higher gas production from their prospects  | 
2015-776 	 strength and elastic properties of paste backfill at the lucky friday mine, mullan, idaho |abstract  at underground mines where cemented backfill is used for ground support, backfill strength properties are an important design consideration, particularly for underhand cut-and-fill mining operations where employees work directly beneath the placed fill  following a backfill roof fall at a deep underground silver mine, standard tests were conducted to determine the strength and elastic properties of a typical paste backfill composed of cemented mill tailings  unconfined compression tests and direct and indirect tensile tests were conducted with core samples obtained from paste fill slabs recovered from the roof fall  test results indicated that the average tensile strengths determined by indirect methods (brazilian and splitting tensile tests) were about twice the average tensile strength measured by direct tensile tests  to identify cold joints within the backfill, in situ direct tensile tests were also conducted on one of the larger backfill slabs using experimental test equipment  the results of these in situ tests were similar to the direct tensile tests and provided little evidence of additional cold joints within the slab  elastic properties of the paste backfill were determined through compression tests with strain-gauged core samples  the results of this study are significant because they add to the sparse strength and elastic property data that are available for mine designs utilizing paste backfill    1  introduction  ground falls are typically the leading cause of fatalities in underground metal mines and a significant source of lost-time injuries [1]  as a result, a well-developed ground support plan needs to be consistently implemented to safely mine under these conditions  in deep underground metal mines, underhand cut-and-fill mining methods are used to mine narrow, steeply dipping veins of ore [2, 3]  in some of these mines, a paste backfill composed of cemented mill tailings is used to support the mined-out stopes or cuts  this cemented backfill forms a massive beam that provides a safe, stable back or roof for the miners who work beneath it on subsequently deeper cuts  the stability of this engineered beam is largely determined by two variables—its thickness and strength  figure 1 shows computed factors of safety for twelve hypothetical backfill beams using four values of thickness and three values of strength [4]  as indicated by these curves, the thickness of the backfill beam is the primary immediate concern, but the backfill’s strength becomes more important as the thickness of the beam increases | 
2015-781 	 geomechanical rock mass characterization with terrestrial laser scanning and uav |abstract  thanks to the improvement of surveying equipments, i e  terrestrial laser scanners (tls) and unmanned aerial vehicles (uav), dense point clouds and very precise 3d models of inaccessible rock cliffs can be obtained  both commercial and self-developed data processing software packages allow the extraction of some parameters regarding discontinuity sets (i e  orientation, intensity, vb, etc )  nevertheless, maps with the distribution of such parameters are still not common  a procedure for obtaining raster maps with the distribution of significant parameters for the geomechanical characterization of rock cliffs, open pit mine slopes and tunnel faces is presented in this paper  some selected case studies in the italian alps will be presented   1  introduction  thanks to the improvement of surveying equipment and data processing software, an increasing use of tls (terrestrial laser scanning) for investigating and monitoring rock cliffs has been made during the last decade (figure 1)  |both scanning speed and operational range have been significantly increased, reducing the surveying time and increasing the extension of the study areas   more recently, professional uavs (unmanned aerial vehicles) equipped with optical and thermal cameras (figure 2) as well as laser scanners became available, making it possible to integrate co-registered tls and uav data into a unique 3d software environment, reducing shadow areas and providing very detailed 3d models of inaccessible rock cliffs with an accuracy of few centimeters   by applying proper software packages, it’s now possible to extract not only the attitude of rock mass discontinuity surfaces directly from the point cloud, but also to map the distribution of significant parameters influencing the behavior of the rock mass, e g  frequency, spacing, p21 (cumulative tracelength per unit area), vb (elementary rock volume), etc  moreover, the possibility of draping high-resolution digital images over either a point cloud or a 3d mesh derived from it enhances the resolution of the 3d model and the capability of extracting geometrical information from the surveyed surface | 
2015-784 	 a new optical fiber sensor for reading rgb intensities of light returning from an observation point in geo-materials |abstract  two plastic optical fibers, both having diameter of 1mm, are used to read local disturbance or deformation at a point in granular material, such as sand, soil, or broken rocks  as light is sent into the 1st fiber and reaches its end, it leaves the fiber and hits surfaces of nearby particles  part of the reflected light then gets into the 2nd fiber, which can be digitally recorded by using photo diode  two fibers can also be aligned such that a gap is created between the fibers for sensing  the paper describes results of several laboratory and field experiments using these new fiber sensors  the examples include cases in which fiber sensors were used to interpret turbidity of muddy water, liquefaction, soil mass movement in a slope and so on  these results show that the proposed new sensors will be able to support data acquisition procedures in many different engineering projects    1  introduction  a new method for monitoring complex behaviors of geo-materials using plastic optic fiber (pof) was proposed by akutagawa et al [1]  unlike in conventional methods of using optic fibers for engineering monitoring ([2], [3]), the new method uses tip of pof as monitoring points  a series of table-top experiments [4] have shown its capability, limits and potentials to obtain information on deformation of sand particles, passage of water in granular material, passage of air bubble, wetting process of dry sand and so on  based on these experiences, a new sensor was developed where brightness and color nature of light returning from observation points can be processed by a cmos-based sensor box  the paper describes the fundamental system of the new device in contrast to the original version in which only brightness of returning light was recorded  several examples are then introduced to show new potential of the proposed method | 
2015-786 	 hydraulic fracturing in shale with h2o, co2 and n2 |abstract  slick-water fracturing is the most routine form of well stimulation in shales; however n2, lpg and co2 have all been used as “exotic” stimulants in various hydrocarbon reservoirs  we explore the use of these gases as stimulants on green river shale to compare the form and behavior of fractures in shale driven by different gas compositions and states and indexed by breakdown pressure and the resulting morphology of the fracture networks  fracturing is completed on cylindrical samples containing a single blind axial borehole under simple triaxial conditions with confining pressure ranging from 10~25mpa and axial stress ranging from 0-35mpa (<u+03c3>1> <u+03c3>2 = <u+03c3>3 )  results show that: 1) under the same stress conditions, co2 returns the highest breakdown pressure, followed by n2, and with h2o exhibiting the lowest breakdown pressure; 2) co2 fracturing, compared to other fracturing fluids, creates nominally the most complex fracturing patterns as well as the coarsest fracture surface and with the greatest apparent local damage; 3) under conditions of constant injection rate, the co2pressure build-up record exhibits condensation between &126;5-7mpa and transits from gas to liquid through a mixed-phase region rather than directly to liquid as for h2o and n2 which do not; 4) there is a positive correlation between minimum principal stress and breakdown pressure for failure both by transverse fracturing (<u+25a1>3axial ) and by longitudinal fracturing ((<u+25a1>3radial) for each fracturing fluid with co2 having the highest correlation coefficient/slope and lowest for h2o  we explain these results in terms of a mechanistic understanding of breakdown, and through correlations with the specific properties of the stimulating fluids   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a mature completion technique which has been extensively applied in tight and unconventional gas reservoirs  for unconventional reservoirs such as shale with extremely low permeability, long horizontal laterals with multi-staged hydraulic fractures are necessary to deliver economic production  the introduction of hydraulic fractures significantly increases flow rate because of large surface contact area between fractures and the reservoir, enhanced permeability around the wellbore, and reduced fluid diffusion lengths (king, 2010; vincent , 2010; faraj & brown, 2010)    water-based fluids have become the predominant type of fracturing fluid  sometimes n2 or co2 gas is combined with the fracturing fluids to form foam as the base fluid  other additives can also be combined with n2 or co2 to improve the efficiency, eg  coupling solids-free viscoelastic surfactants (ves) with a carbon dioxide (co2)-emulsified system to further enhance cleanup in a depleted reservoir, extend the application to water-sensitive formations, and maintain reservoir gas saturation to prevent any potential water blockage (hall, et al , 2005); or incorporating low-polymer-loading carboxymethyl guar polymer and a zirconium-based crosslinker to minimize the damage and maximize production (gupta, et al , 2009)  for unconventional reservoirs in arid areas the availability of water is sparse  in these cases, n2, liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) or co2 may become an “exotic” option for stimulation fluid  for example, fracturing with co2 has been used in places such as wyoming where carbon dioxide supply and infrastructure are available (bullis, 2013)  | 
2015-790 	 predicting intrinsic and apparent permeabilities from pore size distribution in tight porous materials |abstract  the purpose of this work is to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between damage, failure and the transport properties of cementitious materials  many authors have looked for predictive models of porous media permeability  usually, analyses are restricted to intrinsic permeability of the material and the evolution of the apparent permeability, with respect to the pressure gradient and to the nature of the fluid considered are left aside  this paper aims at presenting a new model capable to provide estimates of the apparent permeability directly from the pore size distribution (psd) and from the properties of the fluid to be considered  the intrinsic permeability and the evolution of the apparent permeability with mean pressure are provided by combining darcy’s law which represents the flow in the porous media at the macroscale and a combination of poiseuille’s and knudsen’s laws which represent respectively viscous flow and the diffusion flow at the microscale  in order to achieve a porous network in the material, which is consistent with a mercury intrusion technique, random generation of pores is implemented  the technique yields a hierarchical porous network, which mimics the porous space measured experimentally, without the need for entering neither the tortuosity nor the exact topological information about the pore shapes  comparisons with experimental data acquired on mortar specimens show that the model is able to reproduce the intrinsic permeability and its evolution when the material is subjected to mechanical damage, provided the pore size distributions are available  for a given pore size distribution, the evolution of the apparent permeability is also provided and test data with several types of gases compare quite well with the model    1  introduction  the purpose of this work is to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between damage, failure and the transport properties of cementitious materials  this is typically of utmost importance in the long-term assessment of tightness of vessels and containment facilities   many authors have looked for predictive models of porous media permeability  pioneering work by kozeny [1] related the permeability to the porosity, the tortuosity and an average pore size and later on katz & thompson [2] predicted the permeability from the electrical conductivity of the porous material through a critical pores radius  there are also several studies in which the pore size distribution (psd) was modeled, e g  with a bimodal [3] or multimodal distribution [4], and then entered into some capillary bundle model  recently, models for the calculation of the intrinsic permeability derived directly from the experimental psd, without any idealization have been also discussed [5] | 
2015-792 	 stability of the rock block system involved in the jiweishan landslide in china |abstract  the objective of the paper is to investigate the initiation of the jiweishan landslide by simulating the field geological conditions around and inside a selected critical rock block and then to study its stability through 3-d discontinuum stress analysis  the study led to the following main conclusions: (i) the mining excavations that occurred underneath the investigated block at the landslide site, the friction angle of t2 discontinuities and sliding plane, and the dip angle of the sliding plane seem to be the most important factors with respect to the instability of the investigated block  (ii) it seems that the friction angle of t2 discontinuities and sliding plane need to drop to a value between 5° and 10° for the investigated block to be unstable  this means that rainfall and karstification have played important roles in reducing the said friction angle and contributed to the failure of the investigated block  (iii) the northern part of the investigated block (key block) had moved out first from the top of the mountain in a direction parallel to the strike of the north boundary discontinuity plane (t2) and had undergone shear failure on the t2 surface as well as on a weak shale layer (the sliding plane) and the remaining part of the investigated block (driving block) had moved in a nne direction and had undergone shear failure on the sliding plane and separation from southern and western boundary discontinuity planes (t0 and t1) to fill the empty space created by the key block to initiate the jiweishan landslide   1  introduction  figures 1a and 1b show the jiweishan mountain, located in wulong county, chongqing city in southwest region of china, before and after the slide, respectively [1]  the jiweishan mountain extends approximately ns  its eastern flank is a 50-150 m cliff  the landslide occurred around 3:00 pm on june 5th, 2009  the source area of the rock slide was 720 m long, up to 125 m wide and involved approximately seven million cubic meters of rocks  limestone blocks slid along a weak interlayer of bituminous and carbonaceous shale  the source mass collapsed from the upper part of the slope rapidly and crossed a 200 m wide and 50 m deep creek in front of it  the rock slide debris changed the course after impacting the opposite side of the creek, following the creek profile (fig  2), and traveled about 2 2 km within 3 minutes along the valley and finally formed a large accumulation zone with an average depth of 30 m  this is one of the most catastrophic rockslide events in china in recent years  it buried 12 houses and covered the entrance of an iron mine tunnel in which 27 miners were working at the time  this hazard caused 74 deaths and 8 injuries  compared to other landslides, the jiweishan landslide can be characterized by the following features: (i) higher traveling velocity, (ii) longer running distance, and (iii) more difficult forecasting [1, 2, 3] | 
2015-793 	 deterministic and probabilistic block theory analyses comparison for an open pit mine rock slope in usa |abstract  a new formulation is given to conduct a probabilistic block theory analysis  a new computer code (pbtac) is developed to perform both deterministic and probabilistic block theory analysis  the variability of the discontinuity orientation and shear strength is incorporated in the probabilistic block theory analysis  discontinuity orientation is treated as a bivariate random variable including the correlation that exists between the dip angle and dip direction  pbtac code was applied to perform both deterministic and probabilistic block theory analyses for a part of an open pit mine in usa  needed geological and geotechnical data for the analyses were obtained from field and laboratory investigations  the variability of the discontinuity orientations resulted in important differences between the probabilistic and deterministic block theory analyses results  the results confirmed that the design value selected for the maximum safe slope angle (mssa) for a particular region in the open pit mine based on the deterministic block theory analysis can be on the un-conservative side  in summary, the results showed clearly the superiority of probabilistic block theory analysis over the deterministic block theory analysis in obtaining additional important information with respect to designing rock slopes  the calculated values agree very well with the existing almost stable bench face angles reported by a major mining company which cooperated with this study    1  introduction  the ultimate slopes of an open pit mine are generally excavated to the steepest possible angles because the economic consequences of the excavation angles are significant  for large scale open pits, changes in slope angle by approximately 2–3 degrees may correspond to a large amount of dollars in project value  however, steeper slope angles result in higher probabilities of slope failure  therefore, it is critical to calculate the maximum safe slope angles (mssa) and also to estimate probabilities of slope failure with respect to different cut slope dip angles   the open pit mine slope stability is one of the geotechnical subjects dominated by variability and uncertainty because the slopes are composed of natural heterogeneous materials containing a large number of discontinuities  in discontinuous hard rock masses, the variability and uncertainty of rock slope stability analyses mainly arise from discontinuity geometry and discontinuity strength  application of probabilistic analysis has provided an objective tool to quantify and model variability and uncertainty [1-2]  the first two types of probabilistic analyses to rock slope stability have been applied using either kinematic or limit equilibrium analysis [3-7]  | 
2015-800 	 anisotropic velocities around salt domes via stress models |abstract  we predict anisotropic velocity perturbations around a salt dome on the edge of the sigsbee escarpment in the gulf of mexico, using a combination of 3d geomechanical modelling and the application of rock-physics predictions  the modelling predicts an increase in compressive stress in directions perpendicular to the salt face compared to a background model without salt  this stress increase causes an increase in p-wave velocity in the direction perpendicular to the salt wall  similarly, parallel to the salt wall a decrease in compressive stress is predicted, compared to a salt-less background model  the stress decrease causes a decrease in p-wave velocity in directions parallel to the salt wall  a good match is observed between these predictions andobserved azimuthal seismic velocity variations from a multi-azimuth seismic survey  this firmly establishes a geomechanical cause for anisotropic velocity perturbations around salt    1  introduction  the work of this paper contributes to the general topic of improving the seismic imaging of complex subsurface structures  combining improved subsurface velocity models and more accurate migration algorithms, new wide-azimuth seismic acquisition schemes aim at improving our ability to image steeply dipping and overhanging salt-bodies, as well as sub-salt reflectors  in this context, these imaging applications have benefited greatly from the application of wide azimuthal raycoverage acquisition patterns and processing the data with anisotropic velocity models (zdraveva et al , 2012)  nonetheless, given that anisotropic velocity models are parameterized with large number of variables (compared to the isotropic case), the task of attaining all parameters involved becomes much more complex  given the inverse nature of the imaging process, the analysis of the seismic gathers may prove insufficient in some cases to efficiently reconstruct all parameters describing the subsurface velocity field   this problem was addressed by the work of sengupta, et al  (2008, 2009) and bachrach, et al  (2008), where it was proposed to employ geomechanical modeling in deriving updates to subsurface velocity models in the vicinity of salt  this paper examines the application of these concepts to real field data, where apparent azimuthal anisotropy is observed surrounding a salt diapir  the aim is to provide a geomechanical basis aimed at explaining observed azimuthal velocity changes by numerically simulating the expected geomechanical conditions for subsurface sediments lying in the vicinity of salt bodies and the manner in which these would affect the velocity field  the eventual outcome of this technique should contribute to attaining improved velocity models that incorporate complex geological structures, and therefore, improve the quality of the seismic image  in this paper we show that geomechanically-derived orthorhombic velocity predictions are consistent with wide-azimuth anisotropic seismic data observations in the gulf of mexico  | 
2015-801 	 matching stress-induced 4d seismic time-shifts with coupled geomechanical models |abstract  subsurface pressure and temperature variations can alter rock properties both near and relatively far from the disturbance, causing detectable changes in seismic travel times  in modelling such phenomena, we employ large-scale geomechanical simulations to translate reservoir depletion values into rock deformations accounting for overburden heterogeneity and heavy faulting patterns derived from seismic interpretation  subsequent velocity perturbations are then obtained using straindependent stiffness perturbations from nonlinear elasticity theory  by applying this methodology to a channelized turbidite reservoir located in offshore west africa, we show that appropriate calibrations can generate geomechanically-derived overburden time-shift predictions that reproduce signatures from an actual 4d seismic monitor survey, providing valuable insights into reservoir pressures, rock compressibility and fault stiffness  the results also demonstrate the importance of integrating nonhomogeneous overburden descriptions in successfully explaining many 4d seismic signatures    1  introduction  the advent of reservoir geomechanical models has enabled further levels of subsurface characterization by incorporating the complex interplays between finely characterized rock properties, detailed structural elements and changes in reservoir conditions  the models allow field management strategies to account for the operational risks associated with changes in reservoir pressures and temperatures, and therefore any potential impact this may have in a field’s drilling and production plan  these same pressure and temperature variations can alter rock properties both near and relatively far from the reservoir, causing detectable changes in seismic travel times   many authors have demonstrated the use of geomechanical simulations (driven by the pressure and temperature changes) to explain changes in travel times derived from time-lapse seismic surveys over compacting reservoirs (see hatchell et al , 2003; sayers, 2004; hatchell and bourne, 2005; herwanger et al  2007; janssen et al , 2007; kosco et al, 2010; herwanger et al , 2013)  following these ideas, we employ largescale geomechanical simulations to translate reservoir depletion values into rock deformations accounting for overburden heterogeneity and heavy faulting patterns derived from seismic data | 
2015-806 	 discrete element modelling of microseismic energy associated with hydraulic fracturing in natural fractures reservoirs |abstract  the contribution of natural fractures to well performance in hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in shale reservoirs is not fully understood  to better understand the influence of natural fractures on well performance, numerical discrete element modelling software was used to simulate the hydraulic fracturing process in shale  two cases were analyzed: one with natural fractures and the other without natural fractures  for the first case, the modelling results show that critically stressed natural fractures undergo shear failure caused by the injected water from the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as tensile failures on the extreme limits of natural fracture planes  in the second case without natural fractures, there are only tensile failures associated with the hydraulic fracturing process  the microseismic energy of these shear and tensile failure events are simulated by the modelling software and recorded as a function of time or amount of injected fluid  analyzing the results from both cases reveals a significant difference in the number and magnitude of microseismic events  a variation in the coefficient b of the gutenberg-richter’s empirical formula for the magnitude-frequency relation is observed with and without natural fractures  similar variations in b value measurements are observed using downhole microseismic measurements from hydraulic fracturing in horizontal shale wells  for the downhole microseismic magnitude-frequency relations, it is recommended to use the coefficient b of the gutenberg- richter’s empirical formula to indicate the presence or the lack of natural fractures in shale reservoirs    1  introduction  downhole, buried array or surface microseimic measurements are used to infer the size of the stimulated rock volume during hydraulic fracturing in vertical and horizontal wells  it is, however, often difficult to establish a significant correlation between microseismic events (dots in the box) and well performance  to better understanding the hydraulic fracturing process in complex rocks various numerical models are being developed  one such approach — discrete element modeling (dem) — simulates the hydraulic fracturing process in a rock matrix with or without natural fractures  an output of this modeling method is the microseismic energy associated with either the microcrack of the host material and/or microslip along natural fracture/joint surfaces  the modeling of this microseismic energy is complex and needs to be validated | 
2015-807 	 correlation of the rock mass rating system (rmr) to the unified soil classification system (uscs) for geotechnical characterization of very weak rock masses |abstract  underground gold mines in nevada are exploiting increasingly deeper ore bodies comprised of weak, to very weak rock masses  the rock mass rating (rmr) classification system is widely used at underground gold mines in nevada and is applicable in fair to good quality rock masses, but is difficult to apply and loses reliability in very weak rock mass to soil-like material  because very weak rock masses are transition materials that border engineering rock mass and soil classification systems, soil classification may sometimes be easier and more appropriate to provide insight in material behavior and properties  the unified soil classification system (uscs) is the most likely choice for the classification of very weak rock mass to soil-like material because of its accepted use in tunnel engineering projects and its ability to predict soil-like material behavior underground  a correlation between the rmr and uscs systems was developed by comparing underground geotechnical rmr mapping to laboratory testing of bulk samples from the same locations, thereby assigning a numeric rmr value to the uscs classification that can be used in spreadsheet calculations and geostatistical analyses  more broadly, this rmr/uscs correlation helps define the transition between engineering soil and rock mass classification systems, and may provide insight for geotechnical design in very weak rock masses    1  introduction  underground gold mines in nevada are exploiting increasingly deeper zones composed of weak to very weak rock masses  production zones within ore bodies are typically composed of intensely fractured and highly altered rock with rock mass ratings (rmr) [1, 2] less than 45 [3, 4]  access drifts and infrastructure often intersect faults and altered material of varying thickness and geotechnical quality ranging from blocky competent rock to soil-like material   the rmr system [1, 2] is a numeric geotechnical classification system commonly used at underground gold mines in nevada  rmr data is typically collected from drill core, underground mapping and surface mapping  spreadsheet calcuations and geostatistical analyses are often perfomed on rmr data to construct predictive geotechnical models for a variety of uses including: a) mining method selection, b) stope design, c) ground support design, d) primary development and infrastructure planning, e) estimate development rates and costs, f) anticipate poor ground conditions, and g) quick reference to mine-wide geotechnical conditions  | 
2015-809 	 near field phenomenology for the source physics experiments |abstract  we present a mechanism for shear wave generation from buried explosions as part of the national nuclear security administration (nnsa) source physics experiment (spe) series  spe fielded various sized cylinder-shaped sensitized heavy ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (shanfo) sources grouted into a borehole in the jointed climax stock granite and detonated  a highfidelity site model was included in a numerical simulation that mimics the near field velocity environment measured by an array of in-ground accelerometers  this approach was accommodated through a coupled euler-lagrange (cel) code that allows simultaneous solving of an eulerian domain to model the high-deformation source region and a lagrange domain that includes the complex geology with full contact  specific laboratory-measured geomechanical properties for the rock and the joint sets were included in the model  the simulations compare favorably to the data and provide a possible physical mechanism for unexpected shear motion through the release of stored shear strain on the joints  this research will advance our understanding of explosion generated shear wave energy from low yield nuclear tests  this paper has been approved for unlimited release under la-ur-15- 21405    1  introduction  one of the most important phenomena that remains to be understood in the nuclear verification community is how buried explosions generate shear waves  possible sources for horizontal shear energy generated by explosive sources have been postulated [1, 2], and widely accepted underground nuclear explosion source models currently exist [e g , 3, 4]  these models are based on a spherical source that couples at some radius to the elastic earth  in more recent models shear is accommodated by invoking a damage mechanism [2, 5]  a shortcoming is that the exact phenomenological mechanism for a specific test site is not included in these models  the analysis of the near-field source physics experiment (spe) data described herein proposes a mechanism for shear waves in a jointed rock mass |it has long been observed that near source effects from underground nuclear explosions generate shear waves [1, 2, 6] and that the magnitude and spectra of these shear waves can be used to help discriminate nuclear explosions from earthquakes [7, 8]  recent experiments in granite have been conducted to investigate the near source dynamics of buried explosions – including detonation velocity, fracture, and spall – and attempt to account for shear content in the received waveforms [9, 10]  | 
2015-810 	 use of geodesy to discriminate deformation mechanics in geothermal reservoirs |abstract  surface deformation is commonly observed phenomenon in various geothermal fields and reflects subsurface volume change due to shrinkage or dilation  however, faulting and fault reactivation induced by fluid injection (seismic and aseismic faulting) can also be a significant source of surface deformation  monitoring subsurface deformation is useful in understanding reservoir behavior such as fluid mass and energy transfer and the evolution of transport characteristics  moreover, detection of slip may allow a more precise understanding of injection-induced seismicity  we assess surface deformations (vertical displacement, surface tilt and horizontal strain) as signatures in two different modalities: (i) isotropic volume change (mogi model) and (ii) injection induced shear offset (okada model) and compare the results with both the resolution of current geodetic tools and existing observations of surface deformation  comparison of predicted deformations with instrumental resolutions confirms that geodetic signals, especially tilt and strain, are indeed sufficiently large to describe reservoir evolution in detail and comparison to field data suggests probability of significant contribution of slip on surface deformation    1  introduction  surface deformations of significant magnitude have been observed by both interferometric methods (insar) [1~9] and by direct measurement of surface tilt [10] in a number of geothermal fields  subsurface deformations induced by cold water injection conform to two different modalities: (i) isotropic volume change and (ii) injection induced shear offset  isotropic volume change can be induced by either thermal contraction (volume decrease) or pressure dilation (volume increase) in the reservoir with shear slip similarly resulting from changes in effective stress induced by changes in fluid pressures or temperature    linking the observed deformation signal with a causative subsurface mechanism is useful in defining active processes in reservoir evolution  such models may be used to constrain magnitudes of heat energy transfer from rock to fluid, fluid leakage and the evolution of transport characteristics of the reservoir  the detection of slip processes in turn constrains fluid flow and the evolution of major flow paths  moreover, the detection of slip may allow the precursors to injection induced seismicity to be defined and monitored [11, 12] | 
2015-814 	 multi-scale x-fem faults simulations for reservoir-geomechanical models |abstract  faults are geological entities with thicknesses several orders of magnitude smaller than the grid blocks typically used to discretize reservoir and/or over-under-burden geological formations  introducing faults in a complex reservoir and/or geomechanical mesh therefore poses significant meshing difficulties  in our work, we introduce faults in the mesh without meshing them explicitly, by using the extended finite element method (x-fem) in which the nodes whose support intersects the fault are enriched  for the geomechanics the fault is treated as an internal displacement discontinuity which allows slipping to occur using a mohr-coulomb type criterion  for the reservoir the fault is either an internal fluid flow conduit which allows fluid flow in the fault as well as to enter/leave the fault or a barrier to flow (sealing fault)  in the x-fem, the framework of partition of unity is used to enrich the nodes  the faults are represented by enriching the displacement approximation with a discontinuous (heaviside) function  for internal fluid flow conduits, the approximation for the fluid pressure uses continuous functions that admit a discontinuity in their normal derivative across the fault  for sealing/impermeable faults a discontinuous (heaviside) function is used to model pressure discontinuities across the fault  the procedure has been implemented in both 2d and 3d for both structured and unstructured meshes  examples that demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of the procedure(s) are presented  also, the influence of rate of loading on activation of faults is demonstrated    1  introduction  faults are geological fractures of rock in which there has been relative displacement in the plane of fracture  fault slip reactivation may be triggered by changes in hydraulic pressures and deformations of the rock matrix which occur during injection and/or extraction of resident fluids as a result of disposal of waste water or co2, or as a result of hydrocarbon extraction  fault slips are known to induce seismicity (see e g  [1]), and for potentially generating leaks in containment scenarios  the potential for fault reactivation associated with industrial activities is obviously an important problem not just from a safety point of view but also from a public acceptance perspective  | 
2015-816 	 increasing the pierre shale reservoir volume using heat - part i |abstract  pierre shale is soft and difficult to frac  this is because of its high clay content  to increase the chances of a successful standard frac, we find that shale of this nature could be fractured by using a heat medium  previous research has shown that a small increase in the temperature of frac fluid or water vapor creates a great number of micro fractures in shale, thus increasing the networks of interconnected gas and oil passageways in the shale mass [1,2,3]  use of a heating medium to enhance the production of standard fracking requires documentation of pierre shale thermodynamic properties  a set of experiments was designed to find the specific thermodynamic properties and associated strain properties of pierre shale  specimens of shale were prepared and coated with a film of random paint particles to allow us to perform digital image correlation and strain measurement  the results of data analysis showed that it is possible to create a model of frequency buildup behavior  the graph of strain data versus time shows how the heat waves pass through the shale with specific frequencies as it is exposed to the heat load  additionally, we have calculated poisson’s ratio and the resonance frequency of pierre shale    1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique first pioneered in the 1940s  it is used after the drilling is completed to create fractures in a formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production  this increases the paths in which hydrocarbons can flow and be produced  usually, high volumes of fracturing fluids are pumped into the well at a high pressure  these fluids are usually composed of 99% sand and water, with the other 1% containing additives such as gellant, friction reducers, acid, corrosion inhibitor, clay control chemicals, iron control chemicals, scale inhibitors, and biocide [4]  these additives vary from formation to formation  | 
2015-817 	 analysis and design of pillars for cave mining - a comparative assessment of empirical methods |abstract  usually the study of the strength and stability of pillars in cave mining is performed through empirical, analytical and numerical modeling methods  a comparative assessment of two empirical methods used to estimate the stability of hard rock pillars was conducted  considering different pillar geometries, and specially an abutment stress model, the induced vertical stress in a rib pillar type were evaluated  to demonstrate the application and variability of the outcomes, the factors of safety was calculated taking as input variables the vertical stress over the pillars and the strength values obtained from the empirical methods mentioned  for the simple example of rock pillar stability analysis chosen, it has been demonstrated that a significant range in potential outcomes are possible, based on the natural variability (known and/or unknown) of the rock materials, pillar geometry and induced stress state  the empirical pillar design methods cannot be directly used for the design of pillars loaded in both compression and shear  the improve of rock mass characterization methods, in combination with probabilistic analysis and numerical modeling, may provide a means to incorporate natural variability in modeling parameters into the design of hard rock pillars in deep cave mining    1  introduction  in cave mining projects, the pillars are the main support system for the production and undercut levels  the mining operations must be safe and with a minimum cost of reinforcement and/or repair, so the pillars must be and remain stable   empirical methods provide an attractive rock pillars design option for geotechnical engineers  these provide an effective means of analyzing the geometry, strength, and pillar stresses, as well as the properties of the rock mass  this paper makes a comparative assessment of two empirical methodologies available to design rock pillars, also the scenarios where these are applicable, and in addition the critical parameters required for a complete analysis are studied   a comparative assessment of two largely empirical methodologies used to estimate the stability of hard rock pillars was carried out  considering different pillar geometries, and specially an abutment stress model, the induced vertical stress in a rib pillar type were evaluated by stacey and paige [1], and lunder and pakalnis [2] methodologies  | 
2015-820 	 history and mechanisms of rock slope instability along telegraph hill, san francisco, california |abstract  telegraph hill has a colorful history extending back more than 150 years, and the geology and legacy of this promontory currently haunt the urban corridors that closely line its slopes  telegraph hill is underlain by resistant franciscan complex greywacke sandstone, largely unsheared, and grossly stable  the high quality rock in close proximity to the burgeoning shipping industry was a valuable commodity in the mid- to late-1800s, and the sandstone was mined extensively for seawalls, jetties, roads, and for ship ballast  the quarrying resulted in near-vertical rock faces up to 50m in height along the eastern slopes  the resistant sandstone exposed along many of the old quarried slopes remains standing to this day at near-vertical angles, with very slow retreat rates that resulted in builders gaining confidence in ‘snuggling’ close to these old slopes  the high, steep walls experienced blast fracturing and relaxation jointing from the removal of large volumes of the hillside, resulting in periodic, hazardous rockslides that serve as a persistent reminder of the quarrying legacy    1  introduction  telegraph hill received its name in the mid-1800s from the signal flags, or semaphore, located at the top of the hill that were raised by the lookout to inform residents of incoming ships [1]  prior to the gold rush era, telegraph hill was a uniformly sloped, stable hillside, as illustrated in artist george h  burgess rendering of the hill in 1849 (fig  1) [2]  however, this gently to moderately inclined, rolling hillside topography was dramatically and forever altered when the eastern slope experienced approximately 50 years of intense quarrying activity  the geology of this hillside, with resistant sandstone outcrops along the eastern slope, proved to be an invaluable and irresistible commodity for san francisco’s gold rush and post-gold rush boom  the resistant and hard rock qualities that made this rock so valuable for a variety of construction related activities are also the qualities that have preserved these steep quarried faces, some virtually unchanged, for nearly 150 years  the resistant rock lured builders into placing structures dangerously close to the tops and toes of these slopes, leaving little margin for error  telegraph hill continues to experience hazardous rockslides and rockfalls along an approximate 1 km (0 7-mile) stretch of the southeastern, eastern and northeastern portions of the hill  | 
2015-829 	 analysis of dam abutment erosion by overtopping water using dda |abstract  the potential and extent of erosion due to plunging jets of water from flows overtopping dams need to be evaluated for many dams  hydraulic scouring is a phenomenon that may cause erosion of material downstream, potentially causing dam failure  methods to assess the effects of erosion have received considerable attention in the past few decades  many of the current methods have been developed based on empirical data, carrying a significant level of uncertainty  a numerical simulation based on the discontinuous deformation analysis (dda) is used in this study to allow a physically based assessment that takes into account the actual geologic conditions  conventional dda models are improved to allow the application of time-dependent and heightdependent loads from water overtopping the dam  an abutment slope just downstream of a dam is analyzed considering the joints in the rock mass  the results show that rock erosion is affected by the duration and intensity of the water jet hitting the rock  moreover, rock stability is influenced by the strength of the joints  failure phenomena are observed in some cases analyzed  the purpose of this paper is to present a dda model that incorporates preliminary hydro-mechanical coupling effects and to present some preliminary results of analyses using this dda model to assess dam abutment erosion   1  introduction  in recent years, many dams have experienced significantly larger flood events than they were designed for, resulting in dam overtopping  when dam overtopping occurs, the hydraulic power of the impinging jet might cause foundation and downstream scouring/erosion, which potentially could lead to failures resulting in significant consequences  significant scouring/erosion has been reported at several dam sites worldwide  as future flood events are expected to be more severe due to climate change, dam erodibility is becoming a significant risk concern   dam erodibility assessment typically consists of four steps: (1) selection of the extreme precipitation event to be considered, such as the probable maximum precipitation (pmp); (2) hydrologic rainfall-runoff analysis to estimate the extreme discharge rate, such as probable maximum flood (pmf), that a dam will experience under the extreme precipitation event; (3) hydraulic analysis to compute the impinging water jet load on rock foundation under the extreme flood event; and (4) geomechnical stability/erodibility analysis of the rock foundation subject to the hydraulic load  for step (4), the empirical erodibility index (ei) method [1] and the comprehensive scour model (csm) [2] are the most common approaches used for assessing the potential for dam overtopping scour and erosion  this paper presents an alternative way to complete step (4) using a geomechanical stability analysis  in this geomechanical analysis, the rock mass is modeled as a blocky system and its behavior is analyzed using the discontinuous deformation analysis (dda) [3-6] | 
2015-836 	 optimization of pipe roof design for gongbei port tunnel excavation |abstract  the pipe roofing method is one of the widely used excavation support techniques for conventional tunneling  it is to install steel (or fiber glass) pipes in a canopy shape around the area to be excavated and then to excavate the soils under the protection of the pipe roof  this paper presents the optimization of the pipe roof design for the gongbei port tunnel excavation which represents the largest single tunnel excavation in china  the preliminary design proposed to use a pipe roof consisting of steel pipes with two different diameters which brought serious construability issues  during the construction phase, the contractor optimized the design of the pipe roof by using pipes with a uniform diameter, while adjusting the pipe layouts and optimizing the jacking and receiving plan  the new pipe roof design significantly improves the constructability, as well as reduces the construction cost and shortens the construction duration  the gongbei port tunnel construction expands the conventional tunneling technique by using an unprecedented large pipe roofing system along a curved tunnel alignment, and the optimization of the pipe roof design provides valuable case history experience for future projects   1  introduction  the pipe roofing method is one of the widely used excavation support techniques for conventional tunneling  it is also referred as “steel pipe umbrella” [1], “steel pipe canopy” [2], “umbrella arch method” [3], “long-span steel pipe fore-piping” [4], or “pipe roof umbrella” [5] in the literature  it is to install steel (or fiber glass) pipes in a canopy shape around the area to be excavated and then to excavate the soils under the protection of the pipe roof  the pipe roofing method was firstly used in japan in 1982 and then widely used as an excavation support technique for shallowly buried underground excavations [6]  recent decades have seen many successful case history projects using pipe roof as an excavation support worldwide  the case history experience showed that under the protection of the pipe roof, the disturbance from the excavation to the ground can be significantly reduced and the ground movement can typically be controlled within 2 cm while the deformation of the pipe roof is smaller than 0 5 cm [7] | 
2015-839 	 evolution of ground support practices applied to low quality, squeezing rock at depth |abstract  low quality rock is encountered in many manifestations in underground hard rock mines, ranging from weak and poorly consolidated rock to highly altered or foliated rock  lateral mine developments driven in low quality rock pose on-going challenges to a mine operator, as ground stability issues, such as caving of under-supported ground, drift closure due to surface deformation or buckling processes, and degradation of exposed rock surfaces are a persistent concern   for many operators, ground support design is an iterative process, as support practices are refined with time  this paper presents case examples of a rationales used to develop a support strategy for an isolated drift within squeezing talc-schist rock at depth  field observations, numerical modelling simulation, and trials of a variety of support systems were used to assess conditions and to establish a path forward for long term stability   1  introduction  in ground support applications, the goal of rock reinforcement is to limit the amount of closure around the opening while assisting the surrounding rock to reach a new state of equilibrium  in some mining applications, this equilibrium is difficult to attain since the openings are constantly subjected to bending moments and stress redistribution   the rockmass examples from this paper can be considered as ‘‘mobile ground’’ where the combination of high ground stresses and a weak rock mass lead to the onset of closure soon after the opening has been created   attempts at preventing lateral deformation from occurring, using overly stiff support elements, such as resin rebar, are ineffective as the ground continues to deform around the individual elements  since some deformation is inevitable, managing rather than preventing deformation is the goal of the rockmass support  the rockmass is reinforced with support elements which are sufficiently stiff to provide some degree of lateral confinement, while still permitting some ground movement | 
2015-842 	 modeling interaction between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures in block cave mining |abstract  hydraulic fracturing has been utilized as a pre-conditioning method in block cave mining to improve cavability and fragmentation sizes in recent years  a successful hydraulic fracturing operation depends largely on the interaction between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures  this process has been extensively studied in the oil & gas industry where hydraulic fractures are commonly vertical planar types  in this case, the effects of natural fracture dip angle and vertical in-situ stress are neglected  however, in block cave mining, hydraulic fractures are generally horizontal radial types  the applicability of the existing conclusions for block cave mining needs to be examined  in this paper, the interaction between natural fractures and horizontal radial hydraulic fractures is investigated by theoretical analysis and numerical modeling  it indicates that both natural fracture dip angle and approach angle influence the interaction result, as well as all the three in-situ stresses  it shows that hydraulic fractures are more likely to cross natural fractures if rock tensile strength is sufficiently low, or the product of flow rate and fluid viscosity is sufficiently high  rock masses in block cave mining have mixed-qualities  high flow rate and fluid viscosity are recommended in regions where hydraulic fractures are not able to cross natural fractures   1  introduction  hydraulic fracturing was firstly experimentally used in 1947, and its first commercially successful application was realized in 1949 [1]  from then on, this technique has been widely utilized in the oil & gas industry for reservoir stimulation  in recent decades, hydraulic fracturing has been introduced into the mining industry  initially, it was applied in coal mining for methane extraction since the 1970s in the united states and to control hard roof rockburst [2-5]  then, it was used in cave mining for either caving inducement or preconditioning [6-9]  when hydraulic fracturing is utilized in cave mining, it is more economic compared with the traditional drilling and blasting, and has the ability to improve both cavability and fragmentation sizes [10] | 
2015-843 	 in situ stress measurements during well abandonment |abstract  cap rock integrity is one of the key safety concerns for any fluid injection operations  the estimated minimum in situ stress in the cap rock is one of the inputs used to set the injection pressure limits  these stress magnitudes are typically derived from models that are calibrated to available direct or indirect field measurements  traditionally, stress measurements are acquired as part of drilling operations to pressure test casing shoes  however, availability of high quality data in deep water environments is very limited because of various operational constraints and concerns over weakening and damaging of wells and the formation  to address these challenges, we shifted our data acquisition strategy focus from drilling to well abandonment operations  one of the key advantages of this acquisition strategy is the flexibility and variety of tests that can be performed  the frequency and location of tests can also be tailored to different operations throughout our assets  with this new strategy, we can acquire measurements throughout the full life-cycle of the field  this shift in focus also provides us unique opportunities to acquire high quality measurements directly in the zone of interest without risking the integrity of the well during drilling operations or the cap rocks  in this paper, we intend to highlight several examples to demonstrate how we have successfully integrated and utilized this new data acquisition strategy throughout our deep water portfolios   1  introduction  produced water reinjection, waterflood, steam injection, cutting reinjection, co2 injection and gas injection have become essential components for field developments around the world  integrity of the cap rock is one of the biggest safety concerns for successful execution of these operations  defining a robust injection operation guideline for waterflood or produced water reinjection that achieves maximum pressure/rate while preventing out-of-zone injection has become a critical geomechanics challenge  the reliance on full-scaled mechanical earth models and other analytical or empirical fit-for-purpose models to address safety concerns in the deep-water environment has increased significantly over the last decades:|• maximizing injector performance while ensuring cap rock integrity and containment by defining safe injection guidelines  • enhancing our ability in safely delivering wells by making better estimates of drilling margins for well planning and design in challenging drilling environments  • more reliable input parameters for studying underground blowouts and worst case discharge scenarios  • optimizing field development strategy through realistic forecasts on production- and/or injectioninduced deformation that can cause damages to well integrity and surface facilities | 
2015-846 	 numerical modeling of roof support plans at 4-way coal mine intersections |abstract  this research uses 3-d numerical analyses to analyze selected roof support plans with primary and secondary support in and around four-way coal mine intersection geometry with one corner cut-off  rock mass engineering parameters for analyses were developed using estimated values of gsi and hoek-brown parameters for different roof and floor lithologies  numerical models also included recently developed normal and shear stiffness parameters for the interfaces located in the immediate roof strata  the data shows that the currently practiced roof support geometry may not be achieving appropriate reinforcement of the rock mass around intersection corners and may contribute to roof falls  modeled support plans are considered operationally viable and cost effective  one support plan incorporates principal author’s concepts for improved roof support around intersections  authors also develop here an alternate approach for assessing the rock mass reinforcement effect of roof support plans using numerical modeling data  it utilizes calculating area within critical tensile, compressive, and shear strain zones before and after roof support    1  background and problem statement  supporting intersections in room-and-pillar and longwall mining layouts is a complex engineering problem  active and/or passive roof bolting is the most common primary support at intersections coupled with as needed inclined bolts, trusses, and cable bolts as secondary support  even though intersections account for about 20-25% of the area mined, 70% of the roof falls in the usa with fatal and non-fatal injuries (2002 to 2007) occurred at intersections [1]  a similar study for illinois mines for the period 2004 to 2008 revealed that 80% of roof falls occurred at intersections [2]   a few years ago numerical analyses of an idealized 4-way intersection typical in the interior basin longwall coal mines developed a better understanding of stress and displacement distributions around a four-way intersection [3]  that was followed by similar analyses around physically realistic irregular intersection geometries in development and setup rooms [4]  both studies ignored bedding plane interfaces but identified that the current roof bolting patterns may not provide adequate rock mass reinforcement around the intersection corners  numerical modeling around an intersection can identify critical areas requiring additional reinforcement  appropriate selection and installation of primary and secondary supports around these areas may help minimize failure initiation and propagation  there is also need to develop one or more quantitative parameters that can help compare two roof support plans over a designated area  this study attempts to fill these voids in current research  |

2015-849 	 the technology and practice of rockburst prevention in chinese deep coal mines |abstract  over last 40 years, rockbursts have been responsible for thousands of accidents and fatalities in nearly 140 underground coal mines in china  therefore, rockbursts have become one of the most significant safety concerns in chinese coal industry  in recent years, governmental agencies, research institutes, and coal companies have exerted great efforts studying the rockburst phenomena  state administration of coal mine safety (sacms) revised coal mine safety regulations, re-formulated relevant coal mine design standards, and put forward more stringent requirements in terms of hazard assessments, rockburst monitoring, regional precautions, local preventions, result evaluation, and safety protection  professionals from research institutes and universities analyzed rockburst occurring mechanism, and agreed that the rockburst phenomena is an abrupt destruction of coal/rock mass after its strength capacity being exceeded by corresponding state of stress  several rockburst prevention methods have been developed based on stress control theory, and were applied to chinese coal mines  regional stress control methods, such as optimized mine layout, sacrificial protective mining in selected seam, and so on, were utilized to mitigate potential rockburst conditions  in addition, local stress control methods, such as stress relief via deep borehole drilling, roof strata weakening via pre-mining fracturing or blasting, coal seam stress relief via controlled bursting, coal seam softening via water injection, floor strata blasting, hydro-fracturing, and so on, have been utilized to reduce high stress concentrations, which could otherwise induce catastrophic rockbursts    1  introduction  coal mining is essential to economy development in china  per recent official statistics, about 2/3 primary energy production and consumption relied on coal in china  in 2013, total chinese coal production exceeded 3,860 million tons, and it was projected that coal will remain as main energy source in china within next 50 years   however, shallow coal reserves have almost been depleted after decades of mining  currently, average mining depth of underground coal mines in china is about 600 m  furthermore, 47 coal mines, such as suncun mine in shandong province, zhangji mine in jiangsu province, and no  10 mine of pingdingshan coal mine group in henan province, currently extract coal reserves at a mining depth greater than 1,000 m  as a matter of fact, suncun mine has become the deepest coal mine in asia, with a maximum depth of cover approximately 1,501 m  | 
2015-850 	 movement regularities of roof strata in extra thick coal seams with fully-mechanized mining |abstract  strata behaviors in some extra thick coal seams with fully-mechanized mining are fierce  in some circumstances, some hydraulic supports were still crushed even though their working resistance had been sharply increased beforehand comparing normal supports in medium-thick coal seams  based on field measurement, numerical simulation, laboratory simulation experiments and theoretical analysis, the movement regularities of roof strata in extra thick coal seams with fully-mechanized mining was studied in this article  the studies show that: if an extra thick coal seam is mined in one single time, the thicker the coal seam is, the bigger is the vertical and horizontal movement range of the surrounding rocks, and scope and peak value of the abutment pressure increases obviously  the concepts of “immediate roof” and “basic roof” in extra thick coal seams are different from those in medium-thickness coal seams  the rock strata above the extra thick coal seam would form a structure like “inverted-step cantilever group-articulated rock beams”  such structure breaks periodically with the advancing of the working face, where roof weighting comes regularly in “small cycle - big cycle”  different from high cut mining (3 5~7 2 m  mining height), physical and mechanical features of the top coal in top coal caving mining (<u+2265>7 2 m  height) play a key role in strata behavior  under roof deformation pressure, the top coal was condensed to “a rigid coal structure”  some roof strata deform the top coal while exerting no pressure on the hydraulic supports and they are called “strata without deforming pressure”  while the other part above such strata is called “strata with deforming pressure” since it exert deforming pressure to hydraulic supports via “rigid coal structure”  based on the above knowledge, the lower limit of working resistance of hydraulic support in high cut mining and top coal caving for extra thick coal seams are proposed  | 
2015-851 	 modeling overburden strata movement and theoretical analysis in longwall mining |abstract  statistics were used and analysed in order to determine the overburden movement by using nine borehole extensometers and twenty-seven monitoring anchors  the numerical computer model was established to simulate movement of overburden in shallow coal seam with great panel width, through which the movement features of overlying strata were observed in different face advancing interval  it is proved that fracture zone and curve subsidence zone can be precisely distinguished and the separating deformation between two zones can clearly be seen  the overburden movement continued for three weeks and the mining influencing range of overburden varied from 330 metres to 420 metres  the separation between strata with different hardness has often been formed in the overburden movement    1  introduction  longwall mining method is a highly productive underground mining method in which a panel or a block of coal is completely extracted when a longwall panel of sufficient width and length is excavated [1, 2], the overburden roof strata are disturbed in order of severity from the immediate roof toward the surface, or even the aquifers [3, 4], which can lead to serious mine-flooding accidents and increased damages of the ecological environments [5, 6]  in order to describe the specific overburden strata movement, a numerical model was established to simulate the process of mining by using the flac3d    2  mining condition of study area  the longwall panel studied in this paper is located in the appalachia coalfield, united states  the longwall panels were panels b5 and b6  (fig  1)  the overburden depth varied from 600 ft to 900 ft (180-270m)  the average mining height was 7 ft(2m), panel length was 12,000 ft(3600m) for panel b5 and 5,700 ft(1430m) for panel b6  the panel width for both panels b5 and b6 was 1,433 ft(435m)  the headgate and tailgate entry width was 16 ft (5m)  the chain pillar system between panels b5 and b6 was 200 ft(60m) wide  the average longwall face retreat rate was 30-50 ft/day(9-15m/day) during the longwall face mining under the study area |

2015-855 	 applications of hydro-mechanically coupled 3d mine and reservoire scale, discontinuous, strain-softening dilatant models with damage |abstract  in gas and oil as well as in several mining applications hydro-mechanical phenomena play an important role and need to be considered in numerical models for calibration and forecasting analyses  in this paper, a two-way coupled hydromechanical formulation is described and applied to real size, complex 3d mining and reservoir model examples including structures using the finite-element method (fem) framework  the proposed coupling considers increasing hydraulic conductivities due to the evolution of rock mass damage induced by mining activities or fluid injection  this enables the potential development of additional flow paths and affects the fluid pressure distribution, which, in turn, affects the mechanical response via the effective stress concept  the mechanical framework uses a strain-softening, dilatant and discontinuum constitutive model for both bulk rockmass and structures such as faults on a regional scale and discrete fracture networks (dfn)   1  introduction  hydro-mechanical phenomena for geotechnical extraction applications, as in the mining or gas and oil industries, are very important aspects of global or well stability, subsidence and in some cases, accurate forecasting of recovery  most adverse rock related hydro-mechanical phenomena are stress path dependent  uncoupled or loosely coupled modelling of flow or rock deformation is therefore not ideal; the important fluid rock coupling is over-simplified, or else, the stress path may not be replicated with high similitude   here, we present closely and fully coupled, parallel solution formulation adopting single and multi-phase, multi-component fluid flow formulations into a discontinuum, strain softening, and dilatant finite element model  particular emphasis is on the nonlinear coupling of the deformable and strain softening solid skeleton and the fluid phase(s), e g  the change of hydraulic properties with evolution of damage in the matrix material as well as the effect of pore pressures on the overall stress distribution  this governing system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is embedded in the framework of a finite-element (fe) algorithm and applied to various large-scale real-life mine and reservoir models  | 
2015-869 	 three-dimensional numerical investigation of the effect of injection method on shear stimulation of enhanced geothermal reservoirs |abstract  this paper presents the result of a series of three-dimensional numerical studies that investigate the response of enhanced geothermal reservoirs to injection during the stimulation phase  in these studies, the three-dimensional discrete fracture network is explicitly represented in the model  the numerical analyses are hydro-mechanically coupled, and thermal effects during the stimulation phase are disregarded  the sensitivity studies evaluate how the following aspects of the injection method can improve the total shear-stimulated area: (a) staged injection compared to one stage injection; and (b) injection into cased borehole with multiple hydraulic fracture clusters vs  injection through open-hole completion  in addition, the effect of fracture size characteristics of the reservoir on the shear stimulation response is studied  it is observed that the technique used for injection of fluid has a significant effect on the total stimulated area in the reservoirs    1  introduction  this paper presents part of a comprehensive study that investigates viability of enhanced geothermal systems (egs) using a numerical modeling approach  the purpose of these studies is to evaluate the sensitivity of egs heat production to various in-situ and operational parameters and to come up with optimum conditions for heat production  such numerical modelling analyses are valuable in providing insight into the complex mechanisms that are involved in egs, considering that there is a high level of uncertainty associated with field data    in a series of previous studies, effects of various in-situ and operational parameters on shear stimulation [1, 2] and heat production were investigated in a two-dimensional framework [3, 4, 5]  these studies first investigated how shear-stimulated area (i e , the total area of fractures that experience irreversible dilatational opening as a result of pressurization) is sensitive to different parameters, including density of the fracture network, fracture length characterization, orientation of fractures, injection rate and rate history, viscosity of injected fluid, and the positioning of injection and production wells  subsequently, it was investigated how changes in the aforementioned variables can affect the heat production by evaluating histories of produced fluid temperature and power in typical egs reservoirs for a five- to ten-year period  the two-dimensional studies allowed for performing numerical investigation with reasonable computational resources and led to valuable insight into the response of the reservoir to injection under different conditions  however, it is believed that the three-dimensional studies are essential to understanding certain aspects of reservoir behavior, including how fluid flows in a three-dimensional discrete fracture network (dfn) and how the length and geometry of the borehole segment through which fluid is injected relative to the reservoir size and dfn orientation can affect fluid flow | 
2015-870 	 crack band approach to model 3d hydraulic fracturing of gas shale stratum |abstract  the recent advances in hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas bearing rocks, aka "fracking”, have been nothing less than astonishing  however, several aspects of shale fracking such as the topology, geometry, and evolution of the crack system remain not yet understood  in this contribution, based on the known shale permeability, on the known percentage of gas extraction from shale stratum, and on two key features of the measured gas outflow which are (1) the time to peak flux and (2) the halftime of flux decay, it is shown that the fracturing process is characterized by a very dense crack system, with crack spacing of only about 0 1 m  then, a multi-physics approach to 3d modeling of fluid-driven propagation of a vast network of cracks and open joints in shale is presented  the complex nonlinear and anisotropic mechanical behavior of shale is captured by means of a microplane model  because the crack spacing must be only about 10 cm, the fracture of shale is analyzed as a softening damage, in a smeared way, by the crack band model  3d nonlinear equations governing the flow of compressible cracking fluid through the cracks whose opening and length is controlled by fracture mechanics are formulated    1  introduction  in 2010 shale gas production accounted for 23% of the total us gas production and it is projected to reach 50% by 2035 even at the current extraction efficiency [1-3]  this represents a huge opportunity for technological innovation that, leading to increased extraction efficiency, can generate substantial economic, environmental, and societal benefits   although spectacular advances in hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, have taken place and many aspects are well understood by now, the topology, geometry, and evolution of the crack system remain an enigma  these aspects have to be clarified if the current rate gas recovery from the shale strata, which is only about 5%: to 15%:, is ever to be exceeded    in this contribution, a model to estimate the topology and evolution of the crack system emerging during the fracturing process is proposed  based on the known shale permeability, on the known percentage of gas extraction from shale stratum, and on two key features of the measured gas outflow which are (1) the time to peak flux and (2) the halftime of flux decay, it is shown that the fracturing process is characterized by a very dense crack system, with crack spacing of only about 0 1 m  | 
2015-a 	 qaqc acoustic log and processing |abstract  sonic and density logs are essential for quantitative geophysics studies linking seismic amplitudes to reservoir properties  vp and vs values measured by the acoustic tools influence: elastic property calculations, seismic-to-well ties, wavelet extraction, fluid substitution and amplitude versus offset (avo) modeling   modern acoustic tools use sources that transmit sound energy across a range of frequencies  the energy propagates through mud, formation, and back through the mud again before the signal reaching the tool transducers  during this energy transit, and in the subsequent data processing, the factors that can influence the quality of the data include:  • wellbore and formation conditions: for example, hole size, borehole geometry, mud properties, variation in formation velocity relative to mud velocity for consolidated or unconsolidated (soft or ultra-soft formation), and formation shear velocity relative to the mud velocity    • data processing methodology: the sonic tool is not directly measuring the slowness and velocity  it is only via processing of the travel time of wave propagation relative to the receiver array spacing that it can be calculated    • frequency effects: not all formations respond equally at all frequencies  there is a necessary trade-off between decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the flexural mode that drives the shear slowness versus reducing the size of the dispersion correction at lower frequencies  identification of mixing acoustic modes, problematic receivers, and reading consistency can also be difficult   this paper discusses how these factors can impact on the quality of acoustic data acquired, highlighting the differences between wireline and lwd technologies, and presents a practical work flow that can be employed to optimize data quality   quantitative seismic studies link the measurement of acoustic properties in the wellbore (e g  vp, vs) to observed seismic properties though the development of synthetic seismic traces, well ties, fluid substitution and avo studies (figure 1 and 2)  ensuring high quality wellbore acoustic data is acquired to ensuring appropriate results are achieved | 
2015-f 	 shale fracturing characterization and optimization by using anisotropic acoustic interpretation, 3d fracture modeling and neural network |abstract  multiple fractures or an extensive fracture network is critical for commercially viable production from low permeability formations, such as shales  mechanical anisotropy is inherent in shales because of its platy nature  this inherent anisotropy makes fracture prediction in shales more complex, and traditional methods to predict fracture geometry assuming isotropy frequently prove to be inadequate  current analytical methods boldly assume a constant fracture height and constant mechanical properties for the entire height  common 3d fracture modeling software are based on isotropic rock models, and models that take anisotropy into account are computationally expensive and time consuming, especially when numerous simulations must be performed by varying the input parameters for parametric study   this paper proposes a workflow to improve the prediction of fracture geometry in anisotropic formations  the workflow involves generating a neural network by using a limited number of 3d fracture modeling cases  after the neural network is obtained from a pilot or offset well, it can be easily embedded into software for optimizing fracture design, identifying geologic sweet spots, and predicting fracture propagation and correlating the results to other horizontal or vertical wells in the same geological area   this process can be divided into three steps  first, the anisotropic models are used to predict horizontal and vertical young’s modulus (ehorz and evert), poisson’s ratio (<u+028b>horz and <u+028b>vert), and anisotropic minimum horizontal stress (<u+03c3>hmin_ani) from sonic and density log measurements  second, the elastic moduli properties and <u+03c3>hmin_ani are entered into a 3d fracture modeling simulator to run different cases by varying the completion input parameters  the outputs of the fracture simulator (i e , the fracture length, height, width, and effective length) serve as a training database to the neural network  in the final step, a neural network is generated based on the training database  after the reservoir-specific neural network is developed, fracture geometry can be predicted or optimized for numerous combinations of completion input parameters in a timely and cost effective manner  because the commonly available commercial fracture modeling software assumes isotropy, a new method is presented in this paper to represent mechanical property anisotropy using equivalent young’s modulus (eeq) and poisson’s ratio (<u+03c3>eq)  eeq and <u+03c3>eq are derived from ehorz, evert, <u+03c3>horz, and <u+03c3>vert and the isotropic (sneddon and berry 1958) and anisotropic (chertov 2012) width functions   this workflow is demonstrated by generating a neural network for two reservoirs using anisotropic elastic moduli as predicted by the dipole sonic log  the fracture geometry predicted by the neural network is compared with the conventional method, assuming the isotropic shale rock  the results show that by assuming an isotropic model the fracture width is overestimated, and the fracture containment and propped length are underestimated  the anisotropic neural network model is further run in a large parametric study to demonstrate how the effective length varies with perforation position, injection volume, and injection rate  the results helped to optimize perforation depth, injection rate, and pumped volume  | 
2015-ff 	 characterization of formation fractures with multicomponent induction logging based on biaxial anisotropy models: method and case studies |abstract  borehole multicomponent induction (mci) logging has been successfully used throughout the last decade for evaluation of various types of anisotropic formations, such as laminated shaly sands and low-resistivity reservoirs, by means of the determined resistivity anisotropy (horizontal and vertical resistivity), dip, and dip azimuth  recently, a new application of the mci logging was reported for characterization of formation fractures through fracture detection and assessment of fracture parameters  this new application is a very important step in oil/gas exploration and development because it can significantly help improve drilling and completion decisions made regarding fractured formations  however, to date, literature published related to this new application has been minimal   currently, mci data processing and interpretation schemes are usually based on a transversely isotropic (ti) formation model for fracture characterization  the primary reason is because formations are commonly bedded or laminated, so the ti-model assumption is reasonable under these conditions  in reality, subsurface formations frequently contain different types of (natural or non-natural; open or closed) fractures (or faults), where fractured formations very often display azimuthal resistivity anisotropy in the bedding plane, which leads to biaxial anisotropy (ba) in formation resistivity (or conductivity)  therefore, the mci data processing and interpretation based on the ti models is no longer valid in complex formations where ba is caused by fractures  moreover, the hydrocarbon exploration and development is currently in need of new mci processing and interpretation methods based on the ba formation models so that a more accurate description of fractured laminated reservoirs can be provided  it is well known that fractures can significantly affect fluid flow in formations and a more accurate model of fractures can lead to optimized oil/gas development and production, particularly in unconventional reservoirs  based on the ba formation models and through exploitation of the equivalence between fractured formation models and ba models, a practical integrated method and workflow were developed with multi-array mci tensor data for effective determination of formation ba anisotropy (or triaxial resistivities: rx, ry, and rz), dip, and dip azimuth in fractured formations  because of the complexity of the fracture characterization, a few new fracture identification (fid) functions with a combination of multiple log-data inputs have been proposed for detection of fracture existence, followed by an approach for quantitative estimation of fracture orientation/azimuth, dip, density, etc  along a wellbore   the newly developed method and workflow were applied to synthetic and field data sets for validation and case studies  the application results clearly demonstrate that more accurate triaxial formation anisotropy and dip can be obtained using the new method based on the ba models, compared to the ti processed logs  this allows fractures to be more accurately characterized by integrating corrected tensor measurements (e g , borehole-corrected mci logs) and multiple inverted log data, such as two horizontal resistivities (rx and ry), vertical resistivity, and formation dips based on the combination of both ba and ti models  furthermore, this new application also paves the way to more accurately evaluate different types of fractures in formations, such as shaly sands, carbonates, and unconventional reservoirs using mci measurements and integration of other sensor log data (e g , imaging and sonic data)  | 
2015-fff 	 impact of anisotropic elastic and petrophysical properties on stress prediction in organic-rich mudrocks |abstract |reliable assessment of in-situ rock mechanical properties is critical to the success of geomechanical characterization and fracture treatment in organic-rich mudrocks  however, the evaluation of rock mechanical properties in these formations is challenging because of their heterogeneity, anisotropy, and complex lithology  hence, geomechanical analysis should include a complete definition of the anisotropic elastic stiffness coefficients for stress prediction  furthermore, typical assumptions made for poroelastic parameters (e g , biot’s coefficient equal to one) can result in unreliable geomechanical evaluation for stress prediction  unreliable stress prediction can further lead to unexpected fracture propagation, failure in proppant placement, and, ultimately, unsuccessful selection of completion intervals  the objectives of this paper include (a) measuring anisotropic elastic properties and poroelastic parameters in organic-rich mudrocks and (b) predicting minimum horizontal stresses for organic-rich mudrocks, using laboratory measurements and well logs  we then investigate the impact of anisotropic elastic and poroelastic rock properties on stress prediction  |we first perform triaxial stress and uniaxial strain mechanical tests on core plugs from the haynesville, upper wolfcamp and lower eagle ford shale formations  we obtained correlations between the dynamic and static elastic stiffness coefficients, based on laboratory experiments  we then used well logs to estimate the petrophysical/compositional properties as well as the dynamic elastic stiffness coefficients of the formations  the estimates of mineral composition are used in conjunction with the estimates of elastic stiffness coefficients to obtain anisotropic poroelastic parameters  finally, stress prediction was performed under the assumption of transverse isotropy, which included the measured anisotropic elastic and poroelastic parameters  we evaluated the impact of anisotropic mechanical properties on stress prediction in the lower eagle ford, haynesville, and upper wolfcamp shale formations, with different levels of mechanical anisotropy and vertical heterogeneity  the results show that biot’s coefficient of poroelasticity is not equal to one  therefore, depth-bydepth estimation of anisotropic poroelastic coefficients are required for transversely isotropic media for accurate stress prediction  the estimated minimum horizontal stress gradient assuming anisotropic elastic properties and anisotropic poroelastic parameters, varies by about 40% compared to the case where these parameters are assumed to be equal to one  we also showed that integrated interpretation of petrophysical, compositional, and mechanical properties is important for geomechanical evaluation in organic-rich mudrocks | 
2015-kk 	 joint inversion of array induction and sonic data for radial variations of porosity and saturation in complex mineralogy |abstract  petrophysical analysis for determining porosity and water saturation in complex mineralogy can be challenging owing to the strong effect of light hydrocarbons on sensors such as density-neutron, nuclear magnetic resonance, and sonic sensors  in the new frontier areas of offshore brazil and east africa, complex mineralogy that results from the presence of feldspars, heavy minerals, and varying clay types further complicates traditional log interpretation methods  when drilling uses oil-base mud, additional uncertainty arises from the varying amount of invasion of the filtrate and its effect on log response  in such situations, using acoustic dipole shear and flexural wave dispersion data coupled with induction logs in the petrophysical workflow provides an alternative method for evaluating porosity and water saturation  shear and flexural wave data are less influenced by fluid, and coupling the radial response of the flexural wave data with array induction logs by using a pixel-based joint inversion can provide porosity and water saturation profiles from the near wellbore to the far field  these results compare favorably with routine core analysis for porosity and with special core analysis for saturation height modeling, which indicates a significant improvement over traditional log analysis for key intervals  effective medium models suitable for complex mineralogy and porosity types found in these frontier areas were studied and applied within the multisensor inversion workflow in conjunction with gassmann fluid substitution to evaluate light hydrocarbon effects on the elastic properties of the formation  the results demonstrate an efficient and accurate inversion workflow that can complement traditional formation evaluation in challenging conditions | 
2015-kkk 	 estimating the permeability of carbonate rocks by principal component regressions of nmr and micp data |abstract  the estimation of continuous downhole permeability is widely performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) using the classical approaches of seevers-kenyon and timur-coates  the first approach uses an average of the relaxation times, whereas the latter approach is based on the fractional fluid content computed from a relaxation time distribution cutoff  however, several case studies in the literature reported that these estimators might fail when applied to carbonate rocks in which permeability is often less correlated to porosity, irreducible water content and relaxation times  furthermore, carbonate rocks may have more complex pore body and throat size distributions (e g , bimodal distributions) that may be poorly described by a single parameter of the nmr distribution (i e , the average or the cutoff)   this study develops an estimator that uses multiple nmr distribution bins, representing a general case of the classical estimators  this multivariate approach evaluates the size information encoded in each relaxation time bin to estimate permeability  the multivariate estimators are calibrated with absolute permeability using principal component regression (pcr), whereas classical estimators uses standard multiple linear regression  pcr reliably describes relaxation time distributions in a simple and linear-independent manner according to data variance and is a potentially suitable tool for this multivariate calibration task  the performance of the classical and multivariate estimators are compared after undergoing full cross-validation   an important feature of the novel multivariate approach is the possibility of simultaneously using longitudinal (t1 ) and transverse (t2) relaxation times or simply using a specific segment of the t1, 2distribution  both situations could be highly useful for well logging because nmr activations can either simultaneously acquire complete t1and t2data or can emphasize certain components (e g , the irreducible fluid signal)  moreover, the multivariate estimators can also be applied to size-scaled t1, 2distributions for cases in which relaxation times are less sensitive to permeability, which may occur in many carbonates  by employing mercury injection capillary pressure (micp) data for nmr size scaling, permeability estimates are improved considerably compared to the non-scaled estimates  the superior results achieved with the novel multivariate estimators over the classical estimators indicate that nmr well logging data should be further explored to improve the accuracy of permeability estimates  | 
2015-pppp 	 interpretation of sonic waveforms acquired in high-angle and horizontal wells |abstract  increasingly, more high-angle (ha) and horizontal (hz) wells have been drilled in recent years because of the accelerated development of offshore exploration and onshore organic-shale development  conventional waveform processing methods are developed only for vertical wells  when used in ha/hz wells, these methods may yield biased estimations of p- and s-wave slownesses  new methods are needed to process sonic waveforms acquired in ha/hz wells, specifically in the vicinity of layer boundaries and in the presence of thin layers |this paper examines several ha/hz borehole models when a sonic tool operates across a horizontal bed boundary  high-resolution 3d numerical simulations of sonic waveforms are carried out with a time-domain finite-difference method coupled with a complex, frequency-shifted, perfectly matched layer to study the transient acoustic fields measured in and out of the borehole  these simulations assume a 3d sonic logging tool with multipole sources and 13<u+00d7>8 azimuthal receivers  both monopole and dipole synthetic waveforms are obtained in ha/hz boreholes penetrating hard and soft formations  instead of the conventional processing of monopole or dipole waveforms that takes the average, or difference, of waveforms acquired with azimuthal receivers, we separately analyze the sonic waveforms at each azimuthal receiver  waveforms are first processed with a weighted spectral semblance method to yield modal dispersions; next, we reconstruct formation shear slowness from these dispersion curves with a dispersion correction method  the top and bottom receiver slowness is chosen when the tool measurement point is in the formation above and below the well, respectively  results indicate that this new procedure provides unbiased estimations of rock formation shear slowness compared to conventional processing  moreover, the difference between top and bottom receiver slowness reflects the elastic property contrast between the formation section above and below the well, enabling the accurate evaluation of formation heterogeneity due to bed boundary effects in ha/hz wells |the new sonic waveform interpretation approach introduced in this paper is ideal for the elastic/mechanical assessment of organic shale, in which rock heterogeneity is commonplace | 
2015-q 	 dielectric responses of carbonates from an albian carbonate reservoir, campos basin, brazil |abstract  the igem-4d research project combined petrophysics, geophysics, geomechanics and digital rock modelling to investigate and predict the 4d seismic responses of albian carbonate reservoirs in offshore brazil using 48 core plug samples  the plugs include a range of lithofacies from peloidal grainstones, oncolitic packstones to floatstones  x-ray/sem images and petrophysical properties were measured prior to destructive geomechanical and rock physics testing of the plugs: helium porosity and permeability, brine-saturated low field nmr spectroscopy, benchtop ultrasonic velocity measurement, and dielectric spectroscopy   for the dielectric study, discs of 7-9 mm thickness were cut from the end of each core plug, and these were measured in dry, humidified and brine-saturated state in a custom parallel plate cell  the main suite of measurements used direct coupling of the fluid saturated rock to the gold plated electrodes; the brine-metal interaction inevitably causes electrode polarization effects that limit the lower frequency range of the measurement  a protocol developed at csiro was used to extend the range of measurement to low frequencies using polymer film to block electrode contact and eliminate polarization  the full range of permittivity measurement is thereby extended from sub-mhz to 110 mhz  while the rocks are essentially clay free, rather weak surface polarization can be discerned in the low frequency brine-saturated data and in the response of the humidified samples  the spectra also indicate that the water affinity of the pore surfaces is weak, perhaps from incomplete oil cleaning of all the fine pore space by toluene-methanol treatment  it is also possible that treatment changed the wetting property of the pore surfaces to become hydrophobic to some extend  at the 100 mhz frequency the data fit a crim mixing law very well, and this would imply little dispersion from 100 mhz up to the ghz range would be expected for these rocks   we found moderate correlations between porosity, permeability and dielectric properties of the carbonates that were superior to correlations between conductivity and the pore/flow characteristics  an unexpectedly strong correlation was found between the dielectric constant and the slowness of ultrasonic waves measured at the benchtop on the same disc samples  this may represent the analogy between crim and a time-average wave speed equation   the dispersions in conductivity and permittivity with and frequencies << 100 mhz are not well fitted by a simple model based on the hanai-bruggeman description for grain / brine inclusions with a single shape factor (analogous to an archie m exponent) for the pore space  this is expected as the pore structures seen in sem images and x-ray micro-ct images of the samples are complex and display a large range in size and aspect ratios  indeed, nmr analysis using conventional cpmg measurement of t2 completely fails to capture the pore size (< 100 µm: meso- and micro-scale) distributions of these rocks because of pore coupling effects and weak surface relaxation  while our work is not definitive, it does suggest that dielectric laboratory and logging methods may have advantages for pore structure characterization and for estimation of some useful physical properties in carbonates (e g  elastic moduli), especially when nmr requires slow logging speeds and multi-dimensional acquisition and processing methods to overcome pore coupling problems  | 
2015-tt 	 pulsed neutron through-casing technology for determination of mineralogy and total organic carbon – first case study in the neuquen basin, argentina |abstract  the present paper aims to show the results of the pulsed neutron through-casing technology in a well in the neuquen basin, argentina |this mineralogy service has got its origins in the openhole pulsed neutron generator; elemental concentrations can be further depicted by spectroscopic analysis of the measured gamma ray after applying borehole corrections in open hole conditions  fit-for-purpose software enables lithological and quantitative mineralogical information to be obtained  for more than seven years, this service has proven successful as a differentiator in the determination of key minerals by the measurement of elements in the capture and inelastic spectrum  the challenges of applying this technology in a cased-hole environment included defining relevant corrections for casing and cement gamma ray attenuation effects and their respective contribution effects  this new technology has achieved this goal by processing the acquired data with proprietary algorithms based on sets of lab experiments and tool in-casedhole response standards  the elemental concentrations are corrected for concrete and casing effects and then, processed by the interpretation system to determine the lithology and mineralogy of the zone of interest   this paper shows the comparison between open hole and cased hole data in the same interval of a well logged for ypf –a leading company in e&p in argentina- in the neuquen basin, with successful results in lithological and mineralogical classification in siliciclastic and carbonatic formations  this comparison not only proved an agreement in the mineralogy determination between open hole and cased hole measurements, but also in the determination of total organic carbon (toc)  these results are confirmed by good agreement with x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis of cutting samples |this new technology brings solutions to the oil industry, by lowering operative risks and costs respect to open-hole logging, and it can also be performed in present and older cased-hole wells where the target zone has been by-passed  | 
2015-v56n5a1 	 untangling acoustic anisotropy |abstract |acoustic anisotropy analysis is used in a wide variety of applications, such as fracture characterization, wellbore stability, production enhancement, and geosteering  however, acoustic anisotropy methods are not always understood clearly, both by the end user and the data analyst  azimuthal variations in velocities may be due to stress variations, intrinsic anisotropy, bed boundaries, or some combination thereof  environmental effects, such as hole inclination, centralization, wellbore condition, dispersion and source/receiver matching, affect the viability of the data to detect anisotropy and must be considered in the interpretation  untangling the various acoustic anisotropy types from environmental effects is essential to interpret the results correctly  |this paper begins with a discussion of the types of acoustic anisotropy, followed by a review of common industry methods for extracting anisotropy from wireline and lwd azimuthal sonic data  environmental factors such as tool centralization, irregular borehole shape, poor tool calibration, and dispersion are considered, paying particular attention to the practical limitations of acquiring data suitable for high-quality anisotropy analysis in adverse conditions  |quality control techniques are discussed in some detail, as they help identify various causes of “false anisotropy” due to processing artifacts  quality control plots, such as shear slowness images, dispersion crossover plots, and combined analysis with calliper and microimages, are suggested to aid the nonspecialist in determining whether the anisotropy results are viable  |intrinsic, induced, and geometric anisotropy are discussed in detail, along with consideration of the depth of sensitivity of acoustic measurements  a case study is presented to illustrate the art of untangling overlapping acoustic anisotropy responses | 
2015-v56n5a3 	 using advanced logging measurements to develop a robust petrophysical model for the bakken petroleum system |abstract |the bakken petroleum system (bps) can be considered a hybrid play because it is composed of both conventional and unconventional elements  the conventional aspects include the presence of separate reservoir intervals (scallion, middle bakken, sanish and three forks) and source-rock intervals (lower bakken and upper bakken shales) along with more problematic intervals (basal bakken)  this is in direct contrast to most unconventional shale plays, in which a single lithologic or stratigraphic interval comprises both the source rock and the reservoir  the unconventional aspects of the bps include very low permeability conventional reservoir sections and combined shale-rich source and reservoir intervals  additional complexity results from stacked depositional environments with significant variations in lithofacies, mineralogy, total organic carbon (toc), and rock textures ranging from highly bioturbated to finely laminated  |based on these complexities, a series of research wells were drilled, cored over the entire bps, and logged extensively using advanced logging devices  petrophysical models were developed using both deterministic and probabilistic methods to integrate the measurements acquired for the analysis of porosity, saturation, and mineralogy and for describing the hydrocarbon production potential of the bps more accurately  the advanced evaluation results will enable us to use these wells as benchmarks and calibration points for computation models being developed in areas of the basin where only minimal logging suites such as triple-combo logs exist as data  the confidence gained from these advanced petrophysical models will ensure that the basinwide models, which encompass the entire bps, will better represent the actual production results | 
2015-vvv 	 integrated stress and anisotropy analysis using multi-well borehole sonic and image data in the kinabalu field, malaysia |abstract  the kinabalu field, located offshore east malaysia and operated by talisman, is presently in a phase of rejuvenation with multiple deviated infill wells drilled from the same platform  inclinations range from about 30° to 60° and trajectories are along main fault  some of the reservoirs in the field show signs of depletion due to previous production  these reservoir sands were found prone to sanding  this is evidenced from the early producing wells that have been producing sands at surface   with the current well completions, the operator is constrained to produce the field at economic rates  uncertainties associated with sand failure are constraining them from implementing a more efficient completion design capable of delivering the required production  to make a decision for an alternative completion, geomechanical risks associated to formation stresses and rock strength need to be addressed as the reservoir conditions have changed from initial pre-production conditions  an alternative completion strategy such as perforated cemented liner was considered as it would deliver higher production rates with significantly reduced cost, however there were risks associated  due to lack of data and confidence, uncertainties in rock strength and stress characterization with regard to faulting and historical production were to be reduced; emphasis on measurements was needed  objectives were to quantify rock strength and stress anisotropy to improve the reservoir characterization while minimizing assumptions and analogue field experience   to meet both geomechanical characterization and near-wellbore integrity evaluation objectives, the operator decided to acquire advanced wireline sonic and image tools  the advanced sonic processing provides azimuthal dipole measurements, shear anisotropy, slowness radial profiling and horizontal stress magnitudes  as technical difficulty arises in single-well data interpretation of borehole failure and acoustics, principally because of high inclination of the considered wells, a multi-well approach with advanced acoustics and image interpretations was proposed to overcome these limitations  the maximum stress direction was found more oblique to the fault than initially anticipated and the horizontal stress anisotropy was found to be higher that initially assumed  most of the reservoir sands exhibit stress-sensitivity and near wellbore alteration  these together constrain the perforation and coring strategies in the final well of the rejuvenation drilling campaign  the sensitivity of sand failure and critical drawdown pressure to stresses and perforation design could then be better assessed   given a development strategy with high angle wells and a pressing need to pin parameters down to improve sand failure prediction, acquiring monopole and dipole sonic in stress sensitive formations together with borehole image prove to be an important piece of information  the integrated stress analysis provides valuable information regarding the field stress state  it also provides information on location, extension and orientation of near wellbore alteration  both play critical roles in sanding management and completion design  the operator integrated this information in their geomechanical model to mitigate sanding risk and optimized their completion strategy  the near wellbore alteration assessment complements the change of perforation design to lower density and deeper penetration  as a result, the operator increased production with faster clean up in the final well of the campaign | 
2015-wwww 	 new models for acoustic anisotropic interpretation in shale |abstract  fully characterizing the geomechanical properties of a vertically transverse anisotropic rock, such as shale, requires five independent stiffness coefficients: c33, c44, c66, c11, and c13  in a vertical well, c33 and c44 are calculated from the velocity of the vertically propagating p- and s- waves; c66 is estimated from the stoneley wave velocity  an empirical model must be used to obtain c11 and c13  one widely-used anisotropic model is the annie model (schoenberg et al  1996)  annie obtains the other two coefficients by setting the thomsen parameter <u+03b4> to zero and assuming c13= c12  recently, quirein et al  (2014) modified annie by using new empirical correlations to reduce the prediction bias of c11 and c13 (m-annie 1)  both models, however, require the stoneley wave velocity as input, which prevents their applicability in the conditions of cased-hole or logging without the dipole sonic tools   in this paper, two new anisotropic models are introduced: the velocity regression model (v-reg) and the further modified annie (m-annie 2)  the basis of v-reg is the observed near-linear relationships among measured 0, 45, and 90&$1976; p- and s- wave velocities from the ultrasonic shale core data from the published data set and the laboratory  mannie 2, based on m-annie 1, uses a new constraint of the linear relationship between the thomsen p- and s- wave anisotropy parameters (<u+03b5>=k*<u+03b3>) to replace the stoneley wave constraint to predicting c66   by applying the two new models to the published core data of multiple organic shales from all over the world, their predictive power for the stiffness coefficients, elastic moduli, and closure stress are evaluated  generally, the new models provide as good predictions as the m-annie 1 and better predictions than the annie and isotropic model  they also provide good estimates for c66, with a small bias of approximately 1%  they yield higher predictions for the young’s modulus and closure stress and reduce the underestimation bias of the annie and isotropic model  a sensitivity analysis shows that for the v-reg model, the 45° p- wave velocity has the largest impact on the predictions  finally, the log examples show that the two new models yield predictions consistent with the stoneley wave methods, such as m-annie 1  for some intervals with problematic stoneley wave data, the new models yield better predictions than the stoneley wave methods  both new models, without the stoneley wave velocity as an input, show significant potential in the conditions that the stoneley wave is missing  they could also be used as a quality-check model to validate results interpreted by annie or mannie for conditions which the stoneley wave can be measured but its uncertainty is high |

2153274-ms 	 modeling of near-wellbore hydraulic fracture complexity |abstract   an outstanding question in the design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment is how fractures, which often initiate in ‘non-ideal' orientations under the influence of near-field stress concentrations, propagate outwards and turn towards their ideal orientations under the far-field stress conditions  the major application of this work is to predict the amount and character of near-wellbore complexity as a function of formation characteristics and the pumping fluid viscosity and flow rate  we present the results of multiple 3d hydraulic fracturing simulations to illustrate the general problem of fracture initiation from a circular wellbore  our results are distinct from previously published results because we do not artificially constrain the growth of the hydraulic fracture  this work improves our understanding of how hydraulic fractures initiate and propagate in the near-wellbore region |

2153426-ms 	 from semi-circular bending test to microseismic maps: an integrated modeling approach to incorporate natural fracture effects on hydraulic fracturing |abstract   an integrated cohesive modeling is proposed to analyse hydraulic fracturing jobs in the presence of a natural fracture network  a propagating hydraulic fracture may arrest, cross, or divert into a pre-existing natural fracture depending on fracture properties of rock, magnitude and direction of principal rock stresses, and angle between fractures  activation of natural fractures during fracturing treatment improves the effectiveness of the stimulation tremendously  here, we present an integrated methodology initiated with lab scale fracturing properties using semi-circular bending test (scbt) to determine cohesive properties of rock and natural fractures  we used cohesive finite element models to reproduce laboratory results to verify the numerical model for the interaction of the hydraulic fracture and cemented natural fractures  based on the initial results, distribution of pre-existing natural fractures could play a significant role in the final geometry of the induced fracture network; however in practice, there is not much information about the distribution of natural fractures in the subsurface due to the limited access  hence, we also introduce a special optimization scheme to generate the geometry of the natural fracture network from the location of microseismic events  accordingly, the criteria for evaluating the fitness of natural fracture realizations is defined as the total minimum distance squares of all microseismic events  moreover, an additional constraint in this problem is that we need to set a minimum distance between fracture grids  our results show a constructive approach to integrate microseismic maps with lab mechanical measurements and bottomhole pressure to estimate the geometry of induced fracture network in the subsurface which does not suffer from any limiting assumption about fracture geometries |

2154184-ms 	 integrating 3d seismic and geomechanical properties with microseismic acquisition and fracturing parameters to optimize completion practices within the wolfcamp shale play of the midland basin |summary   this study presents a successful empirical approach based on the integration of numerous multidisciplinary measurements to optimize completion methodologies and future field development strategies for stacked lateral wellbores, and essentially to high-grade exploratory wolfcamp landing zones from 3d seismic data  specifically, we measured mineralogical and geomechanical shale properties directly from 3d surface seismic data lengthwise along lateral well trajectories at individual frac stages which were monitored real-time using microseismic acquisition  linear regression analyses for calibration show strong correlations between inverted seismic p-wave impedance versus microseismic data and fracture pressure responses, shale mineralogy compositions, and geomechanical properties calculated from core data    the method was recently tested in the prolific oil-bearing wolfcamp shale-oil play of the midland basin, west texas, on three horizontal laterals drilled in a "chevron pattern", two of which in the deeper wolfcamp b formation and the third in the wolfcamp a  real-time microseismic monitoring was used to observe the hydraulic fracturing treatments and the resulting heights and lateral extent  although identical pumping schedules were initially intended for all three laterals stimulated in a "zipper sequence", with geometric stage placement, it became apparent during the treatments that microseismic height growth varied significantly across the given laterals within individual stages    the results of our combined analysis showed that microseismic fracture height variability is most influenced by changes in shale stratigraphy and subsequent mineralogy composition, without a definitive relationship with treatment injection rates  optimal fracture heights were observed in landing areas with significant volume of calcite, characteristic of high young's modulus and closure stress, variables which in turn were estimated from 3d seismic  for validation, production history of said laterals and numerous others in the field confirms a strong correlation between seismic p-wave impedance and initial 120 day cumulative oil in landing zones where high volume of calcite and hence brittleness exists | 
2154191-ms 	 numerical study of impact of nano-pores on gas-oil ratio and production mechanisms in liquid-rich shale oil reservoirs |summary   several anomalous production phenomena have been observed in liquid-rich shale (lrs) oil wells, indicating that they are quite different from conventional oil wells  one of these unique phenomenon is flattened producing gas oil ratio (gor) due to nano-darcy permeability of shale rocks and effects of pore proximity on phase behavior and fluid flow in nanoscale pores  to understand true production mechanisms and well production performance in these resources, it is crucial to account for the impact of nano-pores in fluid flow studies    this study discusses the impact of nano-pore confinement on pvt properties, transport properties, rock compaction, how these phenomena affect produced gor of lrs oil wells, and how to incorporate these phenomena into reservoir modeling studies  also, we have developed a methodology for modeling lrs oil wells that simulates gor behavior accurately    the proposed methodology has been applied to construct a compositional simulation model using a single stage hydraulic fracture reservoir model with logarithmically-spaced local grid refinement (ls-lgr) grids  the effect of pore proximity on pvt is considered by introducing new correlations for modifying critical properties of fluid components in nano-pores  production data from several horizontal wells in the eagle ford shale were used for history matching and model calibration    the study shows that "flat" gor's in early stages of production are caused by delayed development of two-phase flow as a result of reduction of the bubble point pressure in nano-pores  enhancement of critical gas saturation delays mobilization of gas molecules in nano-pores and could extend non-intuitive gor behavior further when reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point  the study reveals that period of flat produced gor depends on the volatility of the reservoir fluid and the pore size distribution in the reservoir  for moderate-gor oil reservoirs, the flat gor lasts longer than for highly volatile oil reservoirs  we found that permeability reduction due to compaction on can reduce ultimate oil recovery by more than 20%    this study explored several unique phenomena in lrs reservoirs and presents new correlations for reservoir fluid properties and phase behavior under confinement  these new correlations and the effects of nano-pores can be combined with numerical models to simulate better the performance of lrs oil reservoirs and to estimate eur accurately |

2154207-ms 	 impact of fluid, rock and hydraulic fracture properties on reservoir performance in liquid-rich shale oil reservoirs |summary   conventional methods for analysis of two-phase flow in reservoirs, with underlying simplifying assumptions, are generally not applicable for unconventional liquid rich shale (lrs) oil reservoirs  these reservoirs exhibit multiple pvt systems and complex rock-fluid properties in nano-pores due to pore size effects  it is crucial to understand the production mechanisms and controlling rock and fluid parameters that impact long term production performance to efficiently manage lrs resources and to forecast the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery accurately    we have conducted comprehensive reservoir numerical simulation studies to investigate the impact of rock and fluid properties and production conditions on the performance of lrs oil wells  we used a compositional simulator to model fluid flow in the matrix and in hydraulic fractures  logarithmic local grid refinement in the matrix allowed us to track pressure and fluid saturation changes accurately  matrix grids were divided into nano-pores and macro pores based on pore size distributions reported for the bakken play  separate phase behaviors, rock compaction and relative permeability systems were assigned to each pore system based on pore sizes to account for the impact of nano-pores on reservoir performance  we used a wide range of fracture, matrix and fluid properties in several cases    the results show that the use of multiple relative permeability, rock compaction and pvt systems for different types of pores accurately represent the fluid flow behavior of lrs oil reservoirs, in which gas production and gor trends remain stable for long times  we found that confined phase behavior and fracture spacing impact the initial oil rate while ultimate oil recovery is affected by flowing bhp, fracture geometry, initial solution gas oil ratio and relative permeability  well productivity is sensitive to pore size distribution, especially for highly volatile reservoir fluids, but is not significantly affected by propped fracture permeability  our study revealed that areas beyond the stimulated zone are likely to play only a limited role in overall hydrocarbon production and that completion design and production scenarios can significantly affect short-term production    the study explored the factors that have the biggest impact unconventional oil reservoir production  the results of the study enhance our understanding of fluid flow and performance of lrs oil wells and should help the industry to improve field planning and management | 
2154212-ms 	 fabrication and transport of double emulsion microcapsules for applications in unconventional resources |abstract   double-emulsion microfluidic techniques can produce small spherical capsules, hundreds of microns or less in diameter, capable of containing a wide variety of materials  by carefully selecting the outer shell material, microcapsules can be created that release their contents (i e , are "triggered") under specific thermal or chemical conditions  as such, microcapsules provide an extremely versatile delivery mechanism for transporting target materials for tracer, proppant, or stimulation applications into natural and man-made fracture systems  moreover, the capsules can be engineered to have densities above, below or even close to neutrally buoyant with the carrier fluid, thereby enabling their transport properties to be tailored for a given task    design of microencapsulated particles for specific applications requires accurate models describing their subsurface transport  a principal application for such micro-encapsulated particles is as a substitute for, or as an additive to, traditional fracture proppant  however, the distances that even such traditional proppants are able to penetrate into natural rock systems is poorly understood, in part due to the uncertainties surrounding the methods used to model their transport    in this work, we present ongoing research at lawrence livermore national laboratory into both the fabrication of double-emulsion microcapsules for energy applications, and the transport properties of these particles  we discuss different triggering mechanisms and materials for the capsules, and their potential applications  the transport behavior of the capsules close to the neutrally buoyant limit is also described, through experiments and numerical simulations to test settling rates and the role of particle-particle interactions on capsule transport in fractures    this work was performed under the auspices of the u s  department of energy by lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract de-ac52-07na27344  release number llnl-proc-668998 | 
2154344-ms 	 differentiating wet and dry microseismic events induced during hydraulic fracturing |summary   microseismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing can be caused by a variety of pressure and mechanical effects, resulting in both ‘wet’ microseismic events directly associated with the hydraulic fracture network and potentially remote ‘dry’ events  understanding the cause of the specific microseismic events is critical to standard interpretation of fracture geometry, to avoid overestimation of the fracture geometry by including dry events  furthermore, differentiation of the event types is also important for source characterization interpretations of the fracture deformation  in this study, a geomechanical model is used to understand the conditions for generation of different types of events  predictions of synthetic microseismicity from geomechanical modeling is also used to identify event types based on the hydraulic and stress conditions  the event classification is then used to study various microseismic attributes and test their practical application to differentiate events based on spatial/temporal microseismic characteristics, speed of growth away from the fracture initiation points, source mechanism and frequency-magnitude relationships | 
2154393-ms 	 major obstacles in production from hydraulically re-fractured shale formations: reservoir pressure depletion and pore blockage by the fracturing fluid |summary   gas production from ultra-low permeable shale resources declines drastically at early times upon which organically rich undrained zones are still left at high gas content  in order to enhance nearly flat gas production rates, re-fracturing virgin zones using the newly emerged technologies has been widely implemented in the past few years  therefore, numerical optimizing tools for re-fracturing must capture several production steps including the irreversible reservoir conditions; the depleted reservoir pressure and the associated fracturing fluid pore blockage close to hydraulic fractures  these have not been considered in the production models in the literature    in this paper, we introduce a multi-step production model including the geomechanics effects, followed by a detailed sensitivity analysis for the most influential parameters in gas production  a synthetic shale gas reservoir model is created with logarithmically spaced, locally refined grids (ls-lr-dk) inside the stimulated reservoir volume to accurately capture the physics of flow in shale gas reservoirs  this model consists of the following sequential steps: 1) production from the first set of hydraulic fractures and well shut-in at the re-fracturing time; 2) activation of the second set of hydraulic fractures induced by re-fracturing, and fracturing fluid (water) injection into all fractures to simulate the fracturing fluid invasion into the matrix; 3) fracturing fluid soaking period; and 4) production from the renovated fracture network (the new and old hydraulic fractures)  this model provides a mechanistic approach to include and simulate the following obstacles in gas production enhancement using re-fracturing: 1) reservoir pressure depletion in the initially stimulated reservoir volume as the depleted reservoir pressure cannot strongly repel the invaded fracturing fluid out of the matrix; 2) deep fracturing fluid invasion due to the pressure depletion and the alteration of single phase flow to two phase flow    the results showed that the pressure depletion and the resultant water retainment in the pore space reduced the production enhancement by 5% compared to the base case without these effects  this modification in gas production can influence the risk assessments for further investment on re-fracturing a field yet producing at low rates, and may revise the number of considered fields for re-fracturing | 
2154488-ms 	 assessing tensile strength of unconventional tight rocks using microwaving |abstract   rock tensile strength is a critical parameter needed to design and model hydraulic fracturing (or crack initiation and propagation) in oil and gas reservoirs, especially in tight organic-rich shale  conventional methods for measuring rock tensile strength are either time consuming (direct tensile strength method) or unreliable (indirect method), and require precision "machined" samples and heavy mechanical instruments  we propose a new technique that is simple and rapid for measuring the tensile strength of rocks with low permeability using microwave heating    our method is developed based on the fact that when the temperature of water in a confined space, e g , within a tight rock, increases, water cannot freely expand and consequently the pressure within water-filed pores quickly elevates to the point where it exceeds the rock’s tensile strength such that the rock breaks  microwave heating can rapidly increase the temperature of water in the rock sample due to the relatively large dielectric loss of innate water  this method works well for rocks with low permeability where pressure leak off during the rapid heating is negligible  this paper presents both the theory and results of our initial laboratory tests for the microwaving heating method    the test results demonstrate that microwaving cracks and sometimes pulverizes shales and tight sandstones with water content  when the sample is pulverized, likely 100% of the light hydrocarbons will be released  hence, the proposed method also may provide insight into total recoverable light hydrocarbons per kilogram  we believe that microwave (or electromagnetic wave (em)) heating approach, for some tight reservoirs, has the potential to be further developed to provide a practical waterless fracturing technology |

2154691-ms 	 constraining geomechanical model development by utilizing microseismic derived fracture characteristics |summary   geomechanical modelling of hydraulic stimulations requires data to build and calibrate models to predict decline curves and other aspects of long-term reservoir performance  the initialization of these models requires knowledge of the pre-existing fractures and geological properties of the media  orientations of different fracture sets, their intensities and spacing together with a characterization of their size scales (power law) critically impacts geomechanical predictions of both the stimulations in terms of proppant and fluid placement, but also the decline of reservoir productivity  insight can be gained on the properties of the fracture network through analysis of the microseismic data generated during the stimulation  the frequency response of the waveforms depends on the size of the rupture and necessitates wide band recording in order to provide constraints at a variety of scales  supplementing low frequency sensors with traditional monitoring high frequency sensors extends the resolvable range to larger scale lengths of fractures  for all these scales, with a sufficient sampling of azimuths around the stimulation, the mechanisms and associated fracture planes and stress/strain conditions can be reconstructed through seismic moment tensor inversion (smti) of the recorded waveforms  at smaller scale lengths, signal to noise ratios can be low, and events may not be observed at high enough quality to permit smti  to extend the characterization of these fractures to smaller scales, we use a stochastic optimization algorithm designed to search for optimally placed fractures in the reservoir that intersect with the event locations while constraining their orientations to be from the same distribution observed at the larger (smti resolvable) length scales  effectively, this technique allows for the extension of the power law governing the fracture distribution to smaller scales by invoking observed trends in self-similar behavior  in turn, characterization of the wider band of fractures in the reservoir provides necessary inputs into geomechanical models to predict the fluid and proppant distributions from the full band of generated microseismicity as well as long-term behaviour of the reservoir though decline curve estimation |

2154991-ms 	 modelling based recommendation for choke management in shale wells |abstract   hydraulic fracture conductivity losses because of proppant embedment, proppant failure and rock damage by nonnative fluid interactions are the leading cause of drops in well productivity  these conductivity losses are strongly governed by the local stress regime in the vicinity of the fracture face and the geomechanical responses of the rock to these stresses  drawdown management for shale wells seeks to minimize fracture conductivity losses and matrix permeability impairment in order to create conditions for favorable long-term well performance  this is achieved by controlling drawdown to manage near-wellbore and near-fracture stresses to avoid or mitigate proppant embedment and sharp fracture conductivity decline  however, these approaches may also lead to poor initial production trends    this work focuses on the use of a coupled geomechanical and reservoir flow model for optimizing choke or drawdown management to maximize npv for liquids-rich shale wells  geologic analysis, reservoir and fluid properties and completion-related properties acquired from a prominent liquids-rich shale play within the continental us forms the basis of our study  three different stress sensitive models are used as a proxy for soft, medium and stiff rocks to simulate different degrees of irreversible rock deformation  the geomechanical model considers the effects of hysteresis and choke management strategies developed for a diverse set of rock mechanical properties    the productivity index (pi) along with the cumulative rates are used to evaluate the effectiveness of any chosen choke management strategy  our results indicate that the most critical time period for optimizing long-term well management is during the initial life of the well  high production rates with sharp declines, typical of shale reservoirs, causes irreversible damage in the vicinity of the fracture affecting its conductivity  choking back the wells in anticipation of longer term stable production profiles is also shown to be less than optimal  we compare and contrast several different drawdown settings and demonstrate that the choice of a larger choke setting during the initial life of the well coincides with the highest possible npv and recovery factors over a wide range of reservoir and fluid properties  our results also indicate that irrespective of the choice of drawdown setting, the losses in fracture conductivity and matrix permeability tend to be very severe in the first few days of production | 
2162973-ms 	 using pad isip, dfit, and esp data to generate a pore pressure model for the midland basin |abstract   pore pressure in unconventional reservoirs has been identified as one of the key drivers in well performance  additionally, pore pressure variations between strata may strongly influence hydraulic stimulation containment within target intervals  in the midland basin of west texas, multiple stacked successions of economically proven organic-rich shale sequences vary both vertically and laterally in organic-richness, mineralogy, hydrocarbon storage, thermal maturity, and depth  considering the variability in rock properties, it is reasonable to assume that pore pressures also vary to a similar degree    previous authors have shown that the instantaneous shut-in pressure (isip) during the pad stage of a hydraulic stimulation can be used to approximate the closure stress in wolfcamp shale reservoirs  by manipulating the uniaxial strain equation and substituting isip for closure stress, an approximation for pore pressure can be calculated    this paper describes the process of generating a basin-wide pore pressure model for all spraberry and wolfcamp intervals  the model was built using quality controlled pad isip data points from 8,602 vertical completions to create average pressure gradient profiles at 35 centroid locations across the midland basin  these profiles, along with available zone-specific diagnostic fracture injection test (dfit) data, sagerider system® bottomhole pressure data, and electric submersible pump (esp) pressure gradient estimates, were used to create pressure gradient maps for 17 stratigraphic intervals  to insure the accuracy of the maps, the pressure gradient maps were converted and cross-checked against actual drilling mud weights from horizontal wells drilled in a variety of spraberry and wolfcamp intervals across the basin  the improved pore pressure model has been used as an input into various geomechanical models and predictive maps for hydrocarbon production, resulting in refined well performance predictive maps    additionally, a geologic explanation for the widely disparate pressure regimes present between the regionally subnormally pressured spraberry and the generally overpressured wolfcamp formations is proposed  modeling by previous authors and proprietary pvt data is used to support the hypothesis that regional uplift, varying hydrocarbon compositions due to differing thermal maturities, and good sealing conditions present after hydrocarbon generation and uplift may explain the differences in pressure regimes between the formations | 
2170061-ms 	 unconventional shale gas-condensate reservoir performance: impact of rock, fluid, and rock-fluid properties and their variations |abstract   liquid-rich shale (lrs) reservoirs, particularly lean and rich gas-condensates, are economically attractive but pose unique production challenges  these include productivity losses caused by condensate banking, saturation pressure changes due to pore confinement, and the associated rock-fluid interactions  in recent years, development of these types of reservoirs has advanced with optimal lateral well placement and innovative completion designs  it has been well recognized that initial production rates, their decline during depletion, and the ultimate liquid recoveries are severely impacted by the fluid, rock, rock-fluid properties, and the completions design  thus, it is critical to have an in-depth understanding of the controlling factors related to fluids, rock and rock-fluid parameters that affect the long-term production performance of these reservoirs    we have conducted detailed reservoir simulation studies based on a sector model to investigate the sensitivity of rock, fluid, and rock-fluid parameters, and modeling fracture properties on reservoir performance  the reservoir model consists of a horizontal well and a network of hydraulic, induced  and natural fractures embedded in the rock matrix  the model also includes the effects of changes in fluid saturation pressures due to pore confinement and altered fluid phase behavior in nano-pore environments, interfacial tension (ift)-dependent gas-condensate relative permeability curves and end-points, and the matrix and fracture properties  sensitivity runs allow comparisons of reservoir performance predictions of rates, condensate dropout and the resulting condensate blocking, and ultimate liquid recovery potential    we developed a number of gas-condensate fluid models covering a range of condensate to gas ratios (cgrs) (50 to 250 stb/mmscf) and implementing dewpoint suppression/elevation in nano-pore matrix and its impact on liquid dropout and condensate banking  in this article, we illustrate the results of the simulation study using a relatively rich condensate with a cgr ~100 stb/mmscf  we also used interfacial-tension dependent relative permeability curves and critical condensate saturations (scc) for the matrix and for fractures  the compaction effects of matrix and the fractures during depletion were also accounted for    we conducted a number of sensitivity runs, including elevation/suppression of fluid saturation pressures, ift- dependent relative permeability, critical condensate saturations, and condensate blocking  based on the results of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:    well rate and its decline with time (pressure) are highly sensitive to the fluid, rock, and the rock-fluid parameters, such as the dewpoint pressure, the relative permeability corey exponents and ends point saturations    ultimate liquid recovery is impacted by the condensate dropout characteristics, ift, and saturation pressure changes    the liquid recovery is impacted by the leaning of produced fluids with pressure decline, mobilization of dropped-out condensates, and ift effects on the relative permeability    condensate blocking severely affects gas rates and hence the well productivity  |the results served as a basis for and guided reservoir development strategies and production planning | 
2170875-ms 	 a new physics-based modeling of multiple non-planar hydraulic fractures propagation |summary   because of the low permeability in shale plays, closely spaced hydraulic fractures and multilateral horizontal wells are generally required to improve production  therefore, understanding the potential fracture interaction and stress evolution is critical in optimizing fracture/well design and completion strategy in multi-stage horizontal wells    in this paper, a novel fully coupled reservoir flow and geomechanics model based on the dual-lattice system is developed to simulate multiple non-planar fractures propagation  the numerical model from discrete element method (dem) is used to simulate the mechanics of fracture propagations and interactions, while a conjugate irregular lattice network is generated to represent fluid flow in both fractures and formation  the fluid flow in the formation is controlled by darcy's law, but within fractures it is simulated by using cubic law for laminar flow through parallel plates  initiation, growth and coalescence of the microcracks will lead to the generation of macroscopic fractures, which is explicitly mimicked by failure and removal of bonds between particles from the discrete element network    we investigate the fracture propagation path in both homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs using the simulator developed  stress shadow caused by the transverse fracture will change the orientation of principal stress in the fracture neighborhood, which may inhibit or alter the growth direction of nearby fracture clusters  however, the initial in-situ stress anisotropy often helps overcome this phenomenon  under large in-situ stress anisotropy, the hydraulic fractures are more likely to propagate in a direction that is perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress  under small in-situ stress anisotropy, there is a greater chance for fractures from nearby clusters to merge with each other  then, we examine the differences in fracture geometry caused by fracturing in cemented or uncemented wellbore  moreover, the impact of intrinsic reservoir heterogeneity caused by the rock fabric and mineralogy on fracture nucleation and propagation paths is examined through a three-layered reservoir  finally, we apply the method to a realistic heterogeneous dataset |

2172545-ms 	 uses and abuses of the brittleness index with applications to hydraulic stimulation |summary   we first review some of the definitions of brittleness index (bi) that have been used in the recent literature concerning oil and gas exploration and production from low porosity, low permeability rocks  we will then argue that the definitions characterizing the bi of rocks either by their elastic properties, by their mineralogical composition or by their strength characteristics, are all equivalent and typically result in a higher bi assigned to quartz-rich rocks than to clay-rich lithologies  therefore the majorities of recent definitions of bi are simply a rock- type indicator and are useful as such  however, the separation of rocks into brittle/ductile lithologies on the basis of a calculated bi is not necessarily an indicator of brittle or ductile failure during hydraulic stimulation  we therefore propose that brittleness index is potentially an unfortunate choice of words and can, at worst, be misleading  we will then show how incorporation of elastic and strength properties into a geomechanical model, which additionally includes the stress state and pore pressure, can be used to determine (i) whether hydraulic fractures are likely to be contained in the resource layer and or will grow out of zone (ii) whether rock fails predominantly in tension or in shear during hydraulic stimulation, and (iii) whether hydraulic stimulation will predominantly create new fractures or is likely to re-activate pre-existing fractures and other planes of weakness (such as bedding boundaries) | 
2173459-ms 	 using geomechanical modeling to quantify the impact of natural fractures on well performance and microseismicity: application to the wolfcamp, permian basin |summary   the impact of the natural fractures on the efficiency of a hydraulic fracture is quantified using geomechanical modeling that is able to identify poor hydraulic frac stages clustered where there are too many natural fractures near faults or around low fracture density zones  the best hydraulic fracture stages appear to cluster where there are sufficient natural fractures to create complexity, and are often proximal to large natural fracture trends associated with faults    this paper describes workflows to quantify the impact of natural fractures on the performance of shale wells  first, a method described by white et al , (2014) is reviewed to illustrate the regression analysis approach which may be used on a small area where many image logs and production are available  then, a general workflow that combines geophysics, geology and geomechanics (3g) is discussed and applied to a wolfcamp well  the benefits of the 3g workflow are threefold  first, the quantitative impact of the natural fractures on the regional stress is provided through the differential horizontal stress variation which impacts frac complexity  secondly, an effective modeling technique which accounts for the interaction between the hydraulic and natural fractures in creating the reservoir strain and drainage pathways is described and validated using microseismic data  thirdly, the ability of this model to identify the poor hydraulic frac stages due to the excessive or low fracture density encountered along the wellbore is discussed    building on the validated 3g workflow, a well placement workflow that takes into the account the quantitative impact of natural fractures on the well performance is demonstrated on the considered wolfcamp b well  the workflow provides the optimal position of a well in the presence of natural fractures associated with a fault system that could produce undesirable water  with the current downturn in the petroleum market, it is becoming increasingly important to optimize well placement and completion by using advanced techniques as described by this paper | 
2173789-ms 	 a critical evaluation of simple predictive models relating fluid injection to induced seismicity from shale hydraulic fracturing and wastewater injection |summary   the hazard associated with fluid injection induced seismicity is primarily because of pore pressure increase which can lead to fault slippage and triggering of earthquakes  simple predictive models of induced seismicity have been recently developed to relate potential maximum magnitude of the seismicity to the volume of fluid injection (e g , shapiro et al , 2011; mcgarr, 2014)  however, the underlying simplifying assumptions in these models limit their general validity  we demonstrate how numerical modeling of pressure diffusion and geomechanics, coupled to simple modeling of seismic magnitude, can be used to validate such simplified models and provide better predictions of rock pressurization and the potential for induced seismicity    we conducted numerical simulation of fluid injection in synthetic scenarios for both shale hydraulic fracturing and wastewater injection operations  the objective was to study the critical characteristic of target reservoirs (e g , permeability, stimulated rock volume, existence of conductive faults) for pore pressure increase, stress changes and estimation of moment magnitude of induced seismicity on hypothetical faults  this approach integrates a coupled flow-geomechanical simulation with an analytical model for estimating the magnitude of induced seismicity    our results show how geological properties of target formations can have a strong effect on the potential of induced seismicity by controlling the spatial extent and magnitude of pore pressure disturbance  geological properties of reservoirs are mainly responsible for how rapidly fluid is accepted and pore pressure increase dissipates with distance from the point of injection    while predictive models of induced seismicity are in early stages of development, it is important to understand the limits of their applicability for different scenarios  in particular, we demonstrate the need to include detailed pressure diffusion in predictive models linking fluid injection to induced seismicity | 
2174187-ms 	 a new method of neostress determination from passive seismic data |summary   this contribution describes an entirely new method for determining the neostress (present-day stress) in reservoirs using passive seismic data from surface arrays  until now the only stress information available from passive seismic methods has been derived from the focal mechanism solutions of microearthquakes (meqs)  this method has several weaknesses:    the p and t axes of the solution do not correspond to the maximum and minimum compressive stress axes even though they are often used as proxies    meqs that are sufficiently strong and clear to determine focal mechanism solutions are relatively rare    both surface and downhole microseismic methods are limited in their ability to accurately determine focal mechanism solutions    the method provides information on the orientations, but not magnitudes, of the three principal stresses    focal mechanism solutions yield two potential fault plane solutions which are not determined uniquely  |the new method relies on analysis of the orientation, size, and seismic activity of surface segments of tomographic fracture imagessm (tfis)  tfis are direct images of both induced fractures and natural fractures stimulated by fracking (geiser et al, 2012; doe et al, lacazette et al urtec 2013, lacazette et al, sicking et al, urtec 2014)  the method uses passive seismic data acquired with surface arrays    tfis can be generated as tessellated surfaces  a tessellated surface is a continuous surface composed of triangles with common edges  slip tendency analysis uses the orientations, areas, and cumulative seismic activities of individual triangular facets of tessellated tfis to find the orientations and relative magnitudes of the principal stresses that best fit the properties of the population of facets  if independent stress magnitude information is available then quantitative estimates of the reservoir stresses can be determined  the method has the advantage of working with large data sets (tens of thousands to millions of facets) that are distributed across the region of the reservoir affected by a hydraulic fracture treatment  the large sample leads to robust solutions  also, it may be possible to extend the method to map reservoir stress variations  other important advantages of the method are that it is not dependent on determining first arrivals and is independent of fault plane orientation or meq location |

2178246-ms 	 a regional review of geomechanical drilling experience and problems in the duvernay formation in alberta |abstract   the duvernay formation has been an attractive unconventional play for several producers during the last few years, and the number of drilled wells in this play has been increasing rapidly  nevertheless, drilling in this formation is usually considered a challenging practice due to the extremely high stresses and pore pressures that can be encountered  drilling in the duvernay and its overlying formation, the ireton, has shown a wide variety of drilling incidents such as sloughing, tight spots, bridges and lost circulation  this paper summarizes the results of a comprehensive regional review of drilling experience for 43 duvernay wells  in this review, the details of drilling experience for these wells were documented using a graphical approach that captures important information on the details of drilling incidents including depths and dates, along with information on mud weights and well trajectory  as an initial part of a broader regional geomechanical study of the duvernay, these data were statistically analyzed to identify the stratigraphic and spatial variation of drilling patterns throughout the study area  the results revealed significant differences between drilling patterns in the three major active areas of the play including south (willesden green and edson), central (kaybob), and the northwest regions  in general, wells in the central region can be drilled with lower mud weights than other regions, and experience fewer drilling problems  because pore pressure in the duvernay formation in this area is as high as in the other two regions, the difference in drilling experience was attributed to considerable differences in in situ stress, which appears to be related to the presence of leduc reefs  these stress differences were confirmed by modelling and distribution of fractures in the study area | 
2178289-ms 	 application of mechanical and mineralogical rock properties to identify fracture fabrics in the devonian duvernay formation in alberta |abstract   mechanical rock properties, along with in situ stresses and pore pressure, play critical roles in forming fractures in reservoir rocks  as part of a regional geomechanical analysis of the duvernay resource play, several duvernay cores were analyzed in detail, including the identification of different types of natural and induced fractures  the observed natural fractures include uncategorized natural fractures and polished slip faces (psf) with rare presence of cleavage  coring-induced fractures included petal and petal-centreline fractures and bed parallel parting (bpp)  comparison of the presence of the different fracture fabrics with mechanical and mineralogical properties of the rock revealed strong correlations between rock properties and fracture types  such correlations may be efficiently implemented for characterization of fracture fabrics in the rock using wireline logs or seismic surveys  the observed natural and induced fractures in the cores have also been utilized to revisit and verify the concept of rock brittleness  the analyses show that, as a result of high clay content and overpressuring, the conventional mineralogical and mechanical brittleness indices do not adequately describe the variability of the duvernay formation stratigraphic units  alternative indices developed for this study (i e , plane-strain young’s modulus and clay-based brittleness index) seem to be able to represent the mechanical behaviour of rock much more precisely  this study suggests that using natural and induced fracture fabrics observed on image logs and in cores, along with mineralogical and mechanical rock properties, is a more practical approach to assist with identifying sweet spots in unconventional plays |

i-15-214 	 scaled boundary finite element method analysis of sloshing in axi-symmetric vessels |abstract  this paper describes the development of a new efficient semi-analytical method, namely scaled boundary finite-element method (sbfem) for the analysis of sloshing in axi-symmetric vessels based on multimodal analysis, and the governing laplace equations and linear free surface boundary condition are also applied to the proposed model  a two dimensional eigenvalue problem is obtained by using the scaled boundary finite element method for zero external excitation, which is solved through a variational (garlerkin) formulation that uses three node finite elements by only discreting the boundary of the water surface and walls, then the dimension of the problem is reduced by one  subsequently, based on an appropriate decomposition of the container fluid motion, and considering the eigenmodes of the corresponding eigenvalue problem, an efficient methodology is proposed for externally-induced sloshing, through the calculation of the corresponding sloshing (or convective) masses  numerical results are obtained for sloshing frequencies and masses in spherical vessels and a conical vessel, and the dynamic response of the sloshing is also obtained under different seismic waves  the numerical results are in very good comparison with other analytical or numerical solutions | 
i-15-353 	 numerical simulation on suction anchor installation based on a coupled eulerian-lagrangian finite element method |abstract  details of a three-dimensional finite element modeling on the basis of the coupled eulerian-lagrangian method for simulation on installation of suction anchors are presented in this paper  generally in a process of the design practice of suction anchors, a classical finite element method has been widely used to predict a stress-strain behavior of the soils both inside and outside the suction anchors  but the classical finite element method often leads to contact boundary problems on between the soils and the suction anchors, in particular, when simulating on installation of the suction anchors penetrated into the clay which large deformation occurs  whereas a finite element analysis based on the cel method is well suitable of solving geotechnical contact problems including large deformation of the interface between the clay and the suction anchors  a series of three dimensional finite element analyses based on the cel on suction anchors with ratios of 1:1 to 1:6 (diameter versus penetration depth) were performed and simulated on installation of the suction anchors into the clay  a stress-strain behavior of the clay both inside and outside the suction anchors under installation was investigated  the cel predictions were compared with the design predictions on skirt penetration resistance load by dnv (2005)  the cel predictions gave a correlation with the design predictions within 20% errors  the results indicated that the cel simulation on installation of suction anchors can reasonably provide good predictions | 
i-15-409 	 integrated reservoir flow and geomechanical model to generate type curves for pressure transient responses in shale gas reservoirs |abstract  although a number of researches for modeling of shale gas reservoirs have been conducted, there is a definite lack of literature that concentrates on the geomechanical effects  to account for geomechanical effects with stress dependent porosity and permeability, linear elastic geomechanical model and two stress dependent correlations were applied to the reservoir model  through coupling of flow and geomechanical models for well/reservoir/hydraulic fracture combinations, new approach has been established to predict the pressure transient behavior and to generate type curves  geomechanical mechanisms influence production from 1 to 5 % in shale gas reservoir  this study provides insight into the characteristics of a hydraulically fractured horizontal well and the newly developed type curves yield more unique and accurate results | 
i-15-501 	 retrogressive breach failure events at amity point, australia and their interaction with built defences |abstract  a category of mass sediment transport in certain river and coastal settings is that of ‘retrogressive breach failure’ (rbf)  sand is carried away in a turbulent density current generated by the momentum of sand grains cascading off the face of a retrogressing, subaqueous near vertical wall of sand called a ‘breach’  if such events retrogress onto the shoreline, they can cause serious damage to beaches, banks and manmade erosion defences  while a greatdeal of research effort has been applied to understanding the geotechnical nature of such events, particularly in the united states and the netherlands, we have found that this mechanism of sediment transport is generally not well known to coastal scientists and engineers in australia  this paper describes a site at amity point in eastern australia where successive rbf events have played a major role in coastal recession  measures taken to stabilise the coast are described  the site serves as an unusual case study in coastal management | 
i-15-505 	 random wave induced porous seabed response |abstract  in this study, unlike most previous investigations for regular wave-induced seabed response, a numerical model for random wave-induced seabed response is established to investigate seabed instability based on longuet-higgins random wave theory and finite element method  the seabed is treated as poroelastic medium and characterized by biot's partly dynamic equations (u-p model)  the jonswap spectrum is adopted in longuet-higgins model, which is based on the cumulative superposition of linear solution  based on the numerical results, the effects of random wave on seabed response are investigated by comparing with stokes wave and cnoidal wave  the numerical results indicate that the wave-induced seabed response is affected significantly by the permeability | 
i-15-560 	 numerical study of spudcan penetration induced loading on an adjacent jacket pile in soft clays |abstract  a mobile jackup is an important facility in offshore oil and gas development and often works in close proximity to a permanent jacket platform  the unique operation method and foundation tip (spudcan) configurations of jackups have induced a number of geotechnical challenges  among them, an important issue is that the spudcan will displace a large volume of soil during penetration and may induce severe stresses on adjacent piles supporting the jacket platform  though having general principals, the current industry code does not provide detailed guidance that engineers can follow specifically in practice to quantify this effect  thus, a practical approach was developed in this paper in which the complicated phenomenon was numerically solved in two steps: firstly, the soil displacement of free field around the spudcan was numerically studied using the large deformation technology  the induced soil displacement was found heavily dependent on the soil deformation characteristics such as e50  secondly, the conventional beam-column method using p-y soil springs was adopted to compute the soil displacement induced loading on the jacket pile  on the contrary, the induced pile loading was found not sensitive to the variation of soil e50 within a reasonable range, provided that the matching p-y curves to the soil displacement in free field are used in the sequential analysis  the above approach was validated by centrifugal experiment results published in the past  in addition, the paper discussed how to set up an appropriate boundary condition at the pile head where the pile is connected with the jacket structures, and how to combine the spudcan induced loading with the upstructural loading to determine the ultimate status of a jacket pile  both items have been neglected in the past study but may have profound effect on the final results  |

i-15-670 	 aspects of numerical simulation of torpedo anchor installation |abstract  the dynamic penetration of anchors into the seabed is an important problem in offshore geomechanics and one of the most challenging for geotechnical analysts  complications due to the nonlinear material response of the soil, the large deformations caused by the insertion of the object, and the changing boundary conditions at the contact between the soil and the anchors must be taken into account  moreover, the presence of a pore fluid, and the pressure that it may exert, requires a fully coupled displacement-pore pressure analysis  recent work has facilitated the modelling of the dynamic penetration of objects into soil  the finite element method is one of the most commonly used techniques for tackling problems of soil penetration because the resulting solutions satisfy the equation of dynamic equilibrium and the method can incorporate sophisticated soil models as well as complex boundary conditions  this study discusses a number of challenging aspects of the numerical simulation of dynamically embedded anchors, particularly torpedo anchors, and presents a robust analysis strategy for such problems  this technique is based on the arbitrary lagrangian-eulerian method and rigorously incorporates displacements, velocities, and accelerations of the solid phase along with the pore pressure and velocities of the fluid phase  | 
i-15-723 	 sph study of rapid landslides of cut slopes |abstract  more and more natural slopes are reshaped into cut slopes nowadays and these slopes are prone to landslides  to properly use the land near cut slopes, a method to evaluate the travel distance of cut slope landslides is necessary  this paper firstly reports on the use of sph method for the simulation of the fei tsui landslide, hong kong  then, the influence of geometry of cut slopes is investigated  it is concluded that the soil friction and pore pressure parameters are important in the evaluation of the landslide travel distance  for landslide deposit residing completely at the toe, the volume, slope angle and source angle are important factors for the prediction of travel distance  conversely, the landslide height and the shape of the landslide mass are insignificant  for landslide deposit residing partially on the slip surface, the detailed shape of slip surface is also important | 
i-15-806 	 numerical study of dynamic soil compaction at different degrees of saturation |abstract  dynamic compaction is known as one of the most cost-effective soil improvement techniques  in this method the soil at the ground surface or at a relatively deep depth is compacted by repeatedly dropping heavy weights on the ground  since its introduction, dynamic compaction has exhibited its versatility and simplicity of use in different types of civil engineering projects, including building structures, container terminals, highways, airports, dockyards, and harbours  however, despite the abundance of experimental data and field observation reports, few numerical approaches have been established in the literature to effectively deal with soil behaviour under dynamic compaction  this is mainly due to the dependence of soil dynamic response on variations in the moisture content  therefore, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of dynamic compaction the soil should be modelled as a three-phase porous medium  the presence of a non-wetting and a wetting phase, together with the existence of inertia forces in each phase, makes the solution of the coupled dynamic system computationally demanding  moreover, large deformations often take place during dynamic compaction; hence the infinitesimal strain theory cannot be employed for higher impact loads  in this paper a finite element approach is introduced to numerically simulate the problem of dynamic compaction under the framework of unsaturated soil mechanics  the governing equations are derived based upon the overall momentum balance of the mixture, the mass balance of the liquid phase, and the mass balance of the gas phase  phase changes and chemical reactions are not considered  among other important parameters, the effect of the degree of saturation on the soil response will be addressed |
