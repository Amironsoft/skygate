решению проблем устойчивости стволов горизонтальных скважин и увеличения продуктивности скважин, основанный на физическом моделировании деформационных и фильтрационных процессов в окрестности скважины

пород-коллекторов месторождения им в филановского показана важность учета анизотропии прочностных и фильтрационных свойств горных пород испытания образцов пород показали, что изотропные по упругим свойствам и внешнему виду породы могут обладать значительной анизотропией прочностных и фильтрационных свойств в связи с этим условия разрушения на контуре горизонтальной скважины не одинаковы для различных точек, разрушение ствола начинается с областей пересечения контура скважины и вертикальной плоскости проницаемость пород в горизонтальной плоскости оказалась значительно выше, чем в вертикальном направлении моделирование на установке истнн процесса понижения давления на забое горизонтальной скважины показало, что возникновение в окрестности скважины неравномерного напряженного состояния при создании депрессии на ее забое может приводить к существенному изменению, как уменьшению, так и увеличению, проницаемости пласта в этой зоне причем увеличение проницаемости, и весьма существенное, главным образом наблюдалось при испытании образцов, расположенных в точках пересечения контура горизонтальной скважины с вертикальной плоскостью выполненные исследования позволяют сделать важный вывод относительно выбора приоритетных деформационно-прочностных и фильтрационных характеристик горных пород продуктивного разреза, подлежащих экспериментальному определению для

пород (модуль юнга, коэффициент пуассона, прочностные константы кулона – мора или друкера – прагера и др ) свойства в основном определяют на установках, основанных на принципе кармана, которые не позволяют создавать в цилиндрических образцах пород истинные напряженные состояния, возникающие в пластах в окрестности скважин в то же время деформационные, прочностные и фильтрационные свойства горных пород существенно зависят от уровня и вида создаваемых в них напряжений без учета анизотропии деформационно-прочностных свойств горных пород, а также зависимости их фильтрационных свойств от действующих напряжений выводы и прогнозные рекомендации по обеспечению устойчивости пород в призабойной зоне пласта, максимальным допустимым депрессиям и дебитам скважин могут существенно отличаться
