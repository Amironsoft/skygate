We examine some of the advantages of surface microseismic monitoring and suggest ways in which these advantages can be used to improve the utilization and interpretation of microseismic results. In particular, we show that microseismic events with high-confidence source mechanisms can be used to directly construct fracture networks.
Introduction
Surface microseismic monitoring and downhole microseismic monitoring each offer trade-offs in value. The recognized technical advantages of downhole monitoring include significantly greater numbers of detected events and better depth accuracy; the recognized technical advantages of surface monitoring include better horizontal spatial accuracy and better characterization of the event source mechanisms (Eisner et al., 2011).
Accurately located high-confidence events with well-determined source mechanisms can change our interpretation strategy for microseismic data. Instead of interpreting clouds of events, which requires a statistical approach to infer the presence of fractures, we can build an interpretation, and a fracture network, directly from individual events that each provides a meaningful indication of the presence of a fracture. We call such a fracture network an Event-Guided Fracture Network.
Basic Methodology: Image Domain Pattern Recognition
Classic inversion for source mechanisms from microseismic data requires the identification of the amplitude and polarity of the first arrivals of events in the time domain, which requires much higher signal/noise ratios than are commonly available in surface microseismic data (Eaton and Forouhideh, 2011). For this reason in surface microseismic surveys the source mechanisms may be determined for only a few large events, and smaller events are sometimes assumed to have similar mechanisms. However, it is likely that large events and small events actually have very different mechanisms. For example large events may be related to faulting while smaller events may be related to newly-created hydraulic fractures.
Image Domain Pattern Recognition can be used to determine the source mechanisms of microseismic surface events with very low signal/noise ratios. Figures 1a and 1b illustrate the technique. Figure 1a shows prestack traces from an obvious strike-slip event, after correction for the travel times. The polarity reversals from the radiation pattern are evident in the time domain in the left panel of Figure 1a, and the right panel of Figure 1a shows the event in the image domain. The four lobes of the event are an imaging artifact that is caused by the polarity reversals in the radiation pattern. Figure 1b shows the same event, but with noise added that is 20 times higher than the RMS level of each input trace. After noise is added the event is no longer visible in the prestack traces, and is now a “sub-visible” event. The lobes of the event are still visible in the image domain, and these image lobes can be used to determine the source mechanism. In both cases the source mechanism solution is shown by an inset “beachball” display. The noise caused the solution to result in a slightly different dip, and with a small crack-opening component, but the solutions are quite similar considering that in one case the event is completely buried in noise. The challenge in pattern recognition techniques such as this is computing efficiency (Bagon and Galun, 2011), but for hydraulic fracturing we can benefit by restricting the solutions to those that are geologically reasonable.|","microseismic, monitoring,  interpretation"

Data rotation from the field coordinate system (parallel and perpendicular to the receiver lines) to the natural coordinate system (axes of maximum and minimum shear-wave amplitudes) is a critical step in multicomponent processing. At present, there is a general lack of rotation methods that are free of interpretation or picking biases. This study presents a rotation method that is based on construction of hodograph from first arrival wavelets of the two mutually perpendicular horizontal component geophones. Ease of identification of the first-arrival wavelets reduces the bias in hodograph construction and, in turn, the interpretation of the natural coordinate system. The proposed methodology is applied to a 3D-3C dataset from Rock Springs Uplift, Wyoming, USA, which is a high priority CO2 sequestration site. The natural coordinate system independently established by hodographs of four source-receiver pairs spread across the survey, indicating that the regional fracture trend is 26.60± 5°NNE. The results are also supported by the field geology, strongly suggesting first arrival hodograph construction as a viable means for data rotation in multicomponent processing. |Introduction
In multicomponent acquisition, particle motion is simultaneously recorded along the three principle axes. The benefit of such a recording is the possibility of reconstruction of the full wavefield, which is always more effective in delineating the subsurface rock properties than single component data. Multicomponent processing requires a more holistic approach than their P-wave counterparts. For every shot-receiver pair in a multicomponent survey, a coordinate system can be imagined where one axis radially point away from the shot. When the 3C data are being recorded in a homogeneous isotropic subsurface, the radial horizontal component phone will record the maximum S-wave amplitude. Naturally, the transverse horizontal component phone will record the minimum S-wave amplitude. In the presence of anisotropic sources such as fractures, polarized stress fields and preferentially oriented grains or their combinations, the subsurface becomes birefringent and splits the shear wave into a fast and a slow phase. The plane of maximum S-wave amplitude does not remain radial to the source anymore. The two mutually perpendicular S-wave polarization planes set the natural coordinate system of the survey area. Determining the natural coordinate system can become important, for example, when a reservoir has fracture-induced anisotropy (Thomsen, 1988) and or shot orientation needs to be defined in hydraulic fracturing (Zoback, 2010), or in carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestered studies, where the natural coordinate systems may correspond to the directions of the maximum and minimum in-situ stress fields in the overlying seals.|","case history,  wavelet, 3-C,  converted wave,  multicomponent"

While creating the a lift for local economies and technological advancements, shale gas development also has raised significant concern on surface and groundwater contamination, air pollution, and more recently induced seismicity and geo-hazard risks. In this study, the stress alteration along a fault is estimated using coupled geomechanics and fluid flow modeling. Examples from gas shale and shale oil reservoir hydraulic fracturing and waste disposal operations are provided toward a better understanding and predictive methodology for induced seismicity. The role of various factors on induced seismicity due to fluid injection is discussed. It is shown that microseismic monitoring along with coupled geomechanics and fluid flow models and statistical analysis of the microseismic data can provide a good lead on prediction of fault reactivation and induced seismicity.|Introduction
In the United States, the states with large petroleum reserves and significant unconventional development activities are considered to be the areas with minor seismicity and very little potential earthquakes. However, recent sizable earthquakes (2 - 5.3 Richter) in these low seismicity areas in the states of Texas, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Ohio have raised further concerns and associated interest in the role of fluid disposal as well as the hydraulic fracturing and production on induced seismicity.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) recently reported more than 300 earthquakes magnitude M > 3 Richter in the period between 2010 and 2012 compared to an average rate of 21 events per year in the period of 1967–2000. Most events are associated with waste disposal or water injection for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. Magnitude of these small earthquakes tends to increase as the total injected fluid volumes. Injection pressures and the rates have been studied among the key influencing factors of these tremors.
Microseismic events induced from the hydraulic fracturing operations typically vary in magnitude from –4.0 to –1.0. Induced seismicity from the wastewater injection, as stated in National Research Council report (2012), has occurred in less than 1% of the injection wells. Induced seismicity with magnitude M > 1 Richter scale from hydraulic fracturing operations is also very rare while there is more recorded evidence of induced seismicity activities with higher energy release from enhanced geothermal system operations.|","faults, pore pressure,  induced seismicity,  tectonics,  fracture stimulation"

Fault-controlled damage zones have important implications for fluid flow in fractured reservoirs. We present here a methodology for identification of fault-controlled damage zones in microseismic data using a dataset from the Haynesville shale. We first develop a discrete fracture network (DFN) model of the pre-existing faults shear activated during hydraulic fracturing stimulation. We utilize the DFN to reveal fracture concentrations, diagnostic of fault damage zones. The DFN also reveals a planar zone of diminished microseismic events which we hypothesize are correlative with the fault itself. In support of this interpretation, we show that fault density in the damage zones drops off with distance from the fault according to a power law F=F0r-n which has been observed in faultcontrolled damage zones at other locations 
Introduction|Microseismic events induced during hydraulic fracturing stimulation provide a valuable opportunity to constrain information of subsurface faults (e.g., Deichmann et al., 2014; Stabile et al., 2014; Block et al., 2015). In this study, we present a method for fault identification based on detection of fault-controlled damage zones in microseismic data recorded during multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. We illustrate this method using a data set recorded in the Haynesville shale.
For this study, we choose a microseismic event catalog containing 3159 events that were recorded by a down-hole seismic array during stimulation of a horizontal well located in Haynesville shale (figure 1). We assume each microseismic event was generated from shear slip on a preexisting fracture due to the pore pressure increase during hydraulic fracturing stimulation. We also assume each event location denotes the center of an activated fracture. However, for the very small source dimensions of these events (see below) this is not an important assumption. The shear fracture size can be constrained through event moment magnitude using well-established scaling laws among seismic source parameters. |","unconventional, faults,  fracture stimulation,  microseismic,  fractures"

Forward modelling is a fundamental part of time-lapse seismic feasibility studies and closed-loop seismic reservoir monitoring schemes. The forward modelling workflow represents a complex interaction between multiple domains, each contributing its own set of assumptions, models, and simplifications, based on a priori information. To allow for the best use of the modelled data, the aim ought to be to keep the level of modelling-introduced noise as low as possible to allow for an optimized decision making process on the specifics of a particular time-lapse seismic project. These considerations will have a profound impact on cost and production. It is therefore key to keep 4D signatures subsurface-relevant, avoiding any contributions from low-fidelity forward modelling. To address this challenge, the paper at hand offers a redefined closed-loop seismic reservoir monitoring framework that draws from and caters for a field-scale dynamic integrated Earth model. The validity of the framework and its implications are demonstrated using the purpose built Chimera model which comprises a four-way closure, faulted structure, and represents a turbidite-type reservoir with clastic depositional sequence. 
Introduction
Literature produces many successful examples of timelapse seismic case studies, with carefully analyzed 4D signatures. Calvert (2005) and Johnston (2013) offer detailed insight in this regards, by also simultaneously sketching the state-of-the-art of time-lapse seismic processing. However, quantitative and even qualitative comparisons of differences between predicted and actually measured time-lapse seismic data are much less performed and discussed in open literature, despite the obvious benefit for model reconciliation. An explanation can be found in the assumptions and methodology used for the feasibility study which can be too simplistic to warrant for a meaningful comparison.
When examining 4D signatures, it often turns out that the observed 4D signal is considerably bigger, smaller or different in shape than what was expected from the preceding feasibility study, producing an e term. Given the level of uncertainty within a 4D feasibility study performed, such a mismatch is even expected and the <U+03B5> term can be further decomposed into three chief elements:|","time-lapse,  monitoring,  4D, modeling,  reservoir characterization"

A coupled hydro-mechanical model is used to evaluate fault activation associated with hydraulic fracturing in the Horn River Basin. The model is used to simulate hydraulic fracture growth through a discrete fracture network, examining the pore pressure diffusion and associated fracture dilation and shearing. Based on the geomechanics, the seismic activity can be predicted and used to compare with the actual seismicity monitored during the fracture treatment. The synthetic microseismic prediction includes location, timing and magnitude of the activity and can be used to validate the geomechanical attributes and calibrate the model to match the field data. Applying such a microseismic geomechanics approach not only improves the interpretation of the microseismic image but also improves the understanding of the geomechanical response of the reservoir.
In this study, the impact of the hydraulic fracturing on a preexisiting fault was examined to quantify seismic hazard. A geomechancial model was created to investigate a Horn River Basin hydraulic fracture and the associated seismic magnitudes. The model was designed to investigate the mechanism of fault activation and the impact of fracturing at different locations around the fault. The study indicated that the stimulated fracture network had to grow directly into the fault in order for the injection pressure front to trigger fault slip. Geomechanical assessment of absolute seismic hazard can be used to modify the engineering design prior to operations to minimize the seismic hazard including the placement of the well, and modifiy staging along the well to avoid fracturing in the regions likely to lead to fault activation. In scenarios where induced seismicity occurs during the treatment, the method can also be used to examine operational changes to lessen the relative seismic hazard. 
Introduction|With hightened public concerns of environmental issues with hydraulic fracturing, attention is raising around the few isolated cases of injection-induced seismicity. An increasing number of reports have recently been made of felt seismicity associated directly with hydraulic fracture treatments or disposal of waste water from extraction of unconventional resources. In order to safely and efficiently develop unconventional reservoirs in areas of concern, industry protocols have been developed to deal with induced seismicity issues. Typically these protocols rely on local seismic monitoring to define traffic light systems, where operations are modified depending on the seismicity levels. As part of these protocols, methodologies are required to assess the seismic hazard both prior to the initiation of operations in addition to modifications to planned operations when required by traffic light levels.|","interpretation,  earthquake,  induced seismicity,  microseismic,  modeling"

We demonstrate that the oscillating pore pressure method is suitable for measuring basic set of rock’s poroelastic properties, such as drained bulk modulus, Biot-Willis and Skempton’s coefficients. The oscillating pore pressure method has been initially developed as a method to determine hydraulic properties of rocks (Kranz et al., 1990; Fischer, 1992). We equip our samples with strain gages and subsequently measure deformation, caused by a harmonic pore pressure pulse, propagating through sample’s porous space. By doing so we simultaneously determine poroelastic and hydraulic properties. One of the main goals of the poroelastic measurement is to improve the estimation of the storage capacity from purely hydraulic pore pressure oscillating method. We show that the storage capacity values from the oscillating pore pressure method alone are overestimated by the order of magnitude; measured poroelastic properties for the tested samples are in agreement with literature data. Hence, oscillating pore pressure method is capable of accurately measuring poroelastic properties. |Introduction
The oscillating pore pressure method for measurements of permeability and storage capacity has been previously presented in details (Kranz et al., 1990; Fischer, 1992; Song and Renner, 2007). It is based on inducing time-harmonic diffusive fluid flow through the porous sample and subsequent measurement of the upstream and downstream pressure signals. The propagated through the specimen pressure sinusoid is always phaselagged and attenuated on the downstream side. Once the amplitude ratio and phase has been calculated, we can solve the diffusivity equation with oscillatory boundary conditions and estimate the permeability and storage capacity of the sample.
Although it allows accurate determination of permeability, the estimation of the storage capacity yields large errors, sometimes on the order of several magnitudes (Bernab<U+00B4>e et al., 2006). As mentioned by Bernab<U+00B4>e et al. (2006) the values of the storage capacity are particularly uncertain if the experiment employs large downstream reservoirs. This is usually done in case of high permeability samples (100 mD and higher) in order to achieve measurable phase and amplitude ratio of the two pressure signals. 
The storage capacity of the sample is a poroelastic constant, responsible for fluid storage in the sample and defined as (Wang, 2000; K<U+00A8>umpel, 1991): |","reservoir characterization,  rock physics,  media incompressibility,  pore pressure,  permeability"

In this paper, the Lattice Spring Model (LSM) is adopted in forward modeling of elastic waves propagation in solid medium by combination with the Verlet Algorithm. Different from the traditional methods, such as Finite Difference Method (FDM), Finite Element Method (FEM) etc., LSM is a new method which is not based on the wave equations, but on the microcosmic mechanism that causes wave propagation. Firstly, the origin and history of LSM is introduced. Secondly, the theoretical framework of LSM is elaborated and a stability condition for the evolution of this system is deduced. Then, some numerical results of LSM are demonstrated and they are compared with the wave fields obtained by FDM. Finally, a brief conclusion is drawn based on the previous discussions. 
Introduction
First devised by Grest and Webman in 1984, Lattice Spring Model (LSM) is a collection of linear springs connected at nodes distributing on a cubic lattice used for describing solid medium (Grest and Webman, 1984; Hassold and Srolovitz, 1989). In order to model materials of different Poisson’s ratios, angular springs are added to the original linear spring system (Wang, 1989). Ladd and Kinney (1997) developed this model by taking the idea of elastic element to improve its calculation precision. Such a simple model is sufficient to simulate heterogeneous elastic medium, and its application can be seen in modeling deformation and failure (Ladd and Kinney, 1997; Buxton et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2011).
As is known to all, extensive research has been performed to solve the dynamic problems involving waves, and FDM is the most frequently used numerical method, which solves the wave equation by finite difference approximation of its partial derivative (Toomey and Bean, 2000). Yim and Sohn (2000) adopted a model similar to LSM for visualization of ultrasonic waves, but the evolution of wave fields are calculated by FDM. Pazdniakou and Adler (2012) made a further introduction of LSM and laid the foundation for its potential application in wave propagation in porous media in the low frequency band. Xia et al. (2014) modeled P waves from low frequencies (seismic frequency) to high frequencies (sonic log frequency) by importing a stability conditional for LSM dynamics. |","algorithm,  modeling,  elastic,  wave propagation,  heterogeneous"

The In Salah carbon dioxide storage project in Algeria has injected over 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into a waterfilled tight-sand formation. During injection interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) revealed a doubled lobed pattern of up to 20 m surface uplift above the horizontal leg of an injection well. Analysis indicates this surface uplift comes from the injection of CO2 in this well. We follow previous interpretation of the pattern of depression between two lobes as caused by the opening of a sub-vertical fracture or damage zone at depth above the injection interval, which allows injected CO2 to migrate upward. Interpretation of 3D seismic data reveals the presence of a subtle linear push-down feature located along the InSAR determined surface depression between the two lobe, which we interpret to have to be caused by anomalously lower velocity from the fracture zone and the presence of CO2 displacing in this feature. To enhance the seismic interpretation, we calculated many seismic attributes, including positive and negative curvatures and ant track, from the 3D seismic data. The maximum positive curvature attributes and ant-track shows the clearest linear features, with two parallel trends, which agrees well with ant-track volume and the InSAR observations of the depression zone. The seismic attributes provide a plausible characterization of the fracture zone extent, including height, width and length, which provides important constraint for further study of fracture behavior due to the CO2 injection at In Salah.
Introduction
The In Salah Gas project (a joint venture between Sonatrach, BP, and StatoilHydro) located in the central region of Algeria is one of the world’s first industrial scale CO2 storage projects to be associated with a producing gas field. Natural gas produced from the Krechba field is high in CO2, which is separated and injected into the water leg of the field for geological storage and to help maintain formation pressure. Hirst et al. (2001) described and highlighted sequence stratigraphic subdivision on the stratigraphic column of the area. Over a period of about 8 years, 0.5 to 1.0 million tons of CO2 per year were injected into a 20m thick, water-filled, Carboniferous formation (horizon C10.2 in Figure 1) with relatively low permeability. A high gamma ray log response associated with horizon C20.1 and C20.4 (referred to as “hot” shales, Figure 1) mark the top and base of the lower Carboniferous seal for the CO2 injection interval. The nature of fracturing within the seal is important to understanding storage security at any injection site. For example, how far above the base of the a fracture penetrate is very critical for evaluation of the possibility of reservoir leakage.|","fractures, 3D,  attributes"

In China, goaf water is major source of coal mine water disaster. At present, goaf water quantity is detected by drilling in the coal mine roadway, and the disadvantage is high workload and low efficiency. Therefore, mine transient electromagnetic method was proposed in this expanded abstract. After the calculation of late-period resistivity and time-depth conversion, the spatial distribution range of goaf aquifer was detected. Combined with water-filling coefficient of the aquifer, goaf water quantity can be estimated. The field test in the No.4 coal seam goaf of 80101 workface in Jude mine of Shanxi, western China, shows that the error percentage of the predicted water quantity is below 1.5%. 
Introduction
The mine transient electromagnetic method, MTEM for short, is a geophysical method used in underground roadways of coal mines for observing the secondary eddy current field to detect the time-space distribution. By measuring the change rule of the secondary magnetic field over time during the power-off period, the geoelectricity features at different depths can be obtained. Based on transient electromagnetic principle, ungrounded loop-line can transmit down pulse-type primary field, which may induce an eddy current, then the spatial and temporal distribution of secondary field caused by the eddy current can be observed by coil (Li 2014;Yu 2007; Liu 2009; Jiang 2010; Wang 2012). From Figure 1 it can be seen that, MTEM receives induced signals during the time-off period, which will be attenuated over time. 
Featuring light equipment, little lateral influence, MTEM was applied in water disaster prevention and control. However, in the case of processing method restraints, the analyses are usually qualitative, which cannot meet the standard of quantification, to a certain extent, hold up its wider application (Qin 2014; Tao 2009; Huang 2010; Xu2012). Thus, this expanded abstract will create new method to calculate MTEM response by means of equivalent substitution, interpret the diffusion law of MTEM field by theoretical formula, calculate physical parameters, and conduct 3D apparent resistivity imaging and quantitative analyses of detection results.|","magnetotelluric,  aquifer,  mining, estimation,  apparent resistivity"

Geomechanics of orthorhombic media (a relatively appropriate model for fractured shales), with the assumption of linear elasticity, was investigated using theoretical data. This paper presents the equations for computing anisotropic mechanical properties of orthorhombic media (Poisson’s ratios “vij”, Young’s moduli “Ei”, and minimum/maximum horizontal stresses “<U+03C3>h and <U+03C3>H”). Although nine independent parameters (nine stiffness matrix, Cij, components) are used to define the elastic properties of orthorhombic media, only six Cij components are used to define the above mechanical properties. Simplified equations for computing anisotropic stresses in orthorhombic media (simplified orthorhombic model) are also presented; these equations yield accurate estimates of the anisotropic stresses in heavily fractured media (shear wave splitting or SWS > 10%). Although the simplified equations for the anisotropic stresses are defined using six Cij components, <U+03C3>h or <U+03C3>H can be defined using only three mechanical properties (e.g., two Poisson’s ratio values and one Young’s modulus value). To investigate the mechanical behavior of an orthorhombic medium, a theoretical model was used to create data for fractured shales with two sets of vertical fractures (VTI background + two sets of rectangular, vertical fractures), with variable fracture density (which results in variable SWS values). Based on the modeling results, the values of Poisson’s ratios and Young’s moduli decrease with increasing fracture density (although a few moduli will remain almost unchanged). For all fracture densities, the magnitude of stress anisotropy (<U+03C3>H-<U+03C3>h) can be accurately computed using the simplified orthorhombic model and, for higher fracture densities, the simplified model converge to the exact values. <U+03C3>h can be accurately computed using a simpler VTI model, whereas the <U+03C3>H calculation using VTI or isotropic models will result in significant errors..
Introduction
Unconventional shale reservoirs have extremely low permeabilities. Therefore, natural fractures play an important role in these reservoirs. Areas with high densities of natural fractures are favorable for drilling. Natural fractures usually occur in one or two sets; they are usually vertical (if the vertical stress is the first principal stress). If two sets of vertical fractures exist, they are usually orthogonal to one another (e.g., Thomsen, 2002). Although the vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) model has improved the prediction of anisotropic stress predictions (e.g., Higgins et al., 2008), it cannot take into account the presence of natural fractures in the rock. To consider the vertical natural fractures (one set or two sets of orthogonal fractures) and the intrinsic lamination of shales, the orthorhombic model should be used (e.g., Musgrave, 1970). An orthorhombic medium is defined using nine independent parameters (Cij components). Using the Voigt notation, Hooke’s law for orthorhombic media can be written in a matrix/vector form:|","fractures,  unconventional, anisotropy,  fracture stimulation,  rock physics"

Passive seismic events are generally made by fault displacement, drilling, and hydraulic fracturing during high-pressure fluid injection into boreholes. There are two general configurations of seismic receiver arrays for passive seismic event monitoring: surface and down-hole. Surface arrays provide a larger aperture and hence greater coverage of the focal sphere in comparison to down-hole arrays. However, surface location techniques generally require knowledge of the velocity model to be known a priori. An alternative approach is passive seismic localization which is the procedure of identifying the focal point for the seismic wave field, which in many situations will coincide with the true source position. Whilst these procedures do require assumptions about the nature of the velocity model, it is not required to be parameterized a priori. In this paper, we propose a surface passive localization technique which is applied to both 2D synthetic and 3D field data examples. This work verifies that despite the approximations a reliable event location is achieved. The uncertainty of the proposed technique in the localization of passive seismic events using the bootstrap method was also studied.
Introduction
Unlike active seismic imaging, passive seismic imaging does not depend on the use of a dedicated controlled seismic source. Earthquakes caused by fault displacement, micro-earthquakes (micro seismic) caused by hydraulic fracturing, and vibration generated by drilling, are considered as passive seismic sources. Analysis of the distribution of passive seismic events has proved a useful tool in mining exploration as well as unconventional reservoir development in oil and gas industry (Chambers et al., 2014). It has been used in the mining industry for over a century with different applications: a) estimating seismic velocity down the bore hole in seismic-while-drilling methods (Sun et al., 2014), b) monitoring mining-induced seismicity for the management of hazards in deep hard rock mines (Mikula et al., 2008) and c) detecting the position of drill-bit in the subsurface, such as in the case of coil tube (CT) drilling, when there is uncertainty about the position caused by the flexibility of the tube (Mokaramian and Rasouli, 2013).
There are two methods of passive seismic monitoring: down-hole and surface (Maxwell et al., 2010). Surface passive monitoring provides higher fold and wider aperture above the desired target and allows the possibility of monitoring larger volumes (Chambers, 2010, Duncan and Eisner, 2010). The intrinsic S/N for this technique is low but post-stack S/N can be vastly improved with the fold of the data. However, accuracy of location algorithms depends on the subsurface velocity model which is often not available (Pavlis, 1986).|","passive,  least squares, imaging,  microseismic,  velocity"

We present a 4D Geomechanics workflow that can be used to rapidly screen fields for geomechanical changes occurring during production and estimate the associated time-shifts that you would expect to see in 4D seismic data. This workflow gives a first-order estimate of the reservoir and overburden deformation occurring due to pressure changes in the reservoir. This estimate can be used to model the velocity changes occurring between repeat seismic surveys and the magnitude of the accompanying 4D time-shift signal. We give an example from a case study that shows how this workflow can be used for geomechanical screening and 4D seismic feasibility studies.
Introduction
All reservoirs experience some amount of deformation during production. Reducing the pore pressure in a reservoir increases the effective stress on the reservoir rock, causing the rock to compact. The amount of compaction depends on the magnitude of the pressure drop and the compressibility of the reservoir rock. Conversely, a pressure increase during injection will cause the reservoir to expand. These changes at the reservoir level propagate into the overburden causing it to deform too. However, the amount of deformation at the seabed is always less than the amount of deformation at depth due to support from the sideburden. As a result, the overburden experiences unloading when the reservoir is compacting or compression when the reservoir expands. Seismic velocities are sensitive to these changes. Extension of the overburden causes microcracks to open up, reducing seismic velocities. Compaction causes hardening of grain contacts as they are pushed together, increasing seismic velocities. Although these velocity changes may be small, their cumulative effect over hundreds or thousands of meters combined with the change in path length to the reservoir can lead to measurable travel-time changes between repeat seismic surveys as illustrated in Figure 1.
In general, reservoirs that experience significant geomechanical changes during production can be grouped into three categories: 1) compressible chalks such as the Valhall reservoir in the North Sea which has undergone more than 10m of compaction since production started in 1982 (Kristiansen & Plischke, 2010), 2) unconsolidated turbidite sands such as Holstein and Genesis in the Gulf of Mexico (Ebaid et al, 2008; Hodgson et al, 2007), and 3) high pressure reservoirs such as Elgin, Franklin and Shearwater in the North Sea (de Gennaro et al, 2008; Staples et al, 2007).|","4D,  monitoring, modeling,  time-lapse"

Several authors have demonstrated the use of coupled geomechanical simulations to explain changes in traveltimes derived from time-lapse seismic surveys over compacting reservoirs (see Hatchell et al., 2003; Sayers, 2004; Hatchell and Bourne, 2005; Herwanger et al. 2007; Janssen et al., 2007; Kosco et al, 2010; Herwanger et al., 2013). Under this same concept, we have employed large-scale geomechanical simulations to translate reservoir depletion values into rock deformations and subsurface velocity changes. We apply this methodology to channelized turbidite complexes of the Dalia field, located in Block 17, offshore West Africa, aiming to generate a geomechanically derived overburden time-shift model and validate predicted signatures against an actual 4D seismic monitor survey. Our results are able to replicate both slow-down and speedups in the vicinity of depleted sand bodies, following patterns consistent with stress-arching effects in the overburden.
Geomechanical Modeling of Overburden Behavior
Full-field geomechanical models have been previously employed in the Dalia field to successfully address infill issues (see Onaisi, 2014; Pourpak et al., 2014; Onaisi et al., 2015). Building on this experience, this paper explores the notion of how geomechanical models can assist in explaining production-induced time-lapse seismic signatures. Because reservoir seismic velocity changes are also strongly affected by saturation changes, most of the scope of this paper is limited to the overburden immediately overlying the reservoir.
The Dalia field, located in Block 17, offshore West Africa, is characterized by four main sedimentary complexes, called Upper Main Channel, Lower Main Channel, Lower Flanks, and Camelia. The reservoirs are of Lower Miocene age, consisting of unconsolidated sandy turbiditic deposits. Depositional and erosional geometries, along with sedimentary facies distribution, affect fluid flow by a complex network of preferential pathways (Pluchery et al., 2013). The reservoir layers lie not very far (about 800 m) below the seabed, forming unconsolidated and heterogeneous oil reservoirs (see Prat el al., 2010; Pluchery et al., 2013). This area is also characterized by high-resolution seismic data (down to 10 m) that is used for fine reservoir characterization and monitoring (Gonzalez-Carballo, et al., 2006; Vemba, et al., 2011). As described by Onaisi et al. (2015), a geomechanical model was constructed based on seismic inversion data, representing present-day conditions throughout the reservoir and its surroundings. For such purposes, we used a finite element geomechanical modeling engine (Koutsabeloulis and Hope, 1998) to produce a 3D map of stress and strain magnitudes and orientations that vary both laterally and vertically. The model uses pore pressures from a reservoir simulator, structure, rock mechanical properties, and far-field horizontal stresses imposed as boundary conditions to simulate the initial stress state of the field, calibrated with well measurements and with drilling experience.|","4D, monitoring"

Stressed, fractured rocks can have complex symmetry. Understanding the compaction and burial history of a basin can be used to better build complex models based on geological concepts and numerical modeling. In this example, we show how 3D stress modeling through basin evolution in time (4D geomechanical basin modeling) enables us to identify fracture orientation based on failure criteria and direction of minimum principal stresses which together with the structural geometry and rock physics modeling can be transformed into the anisotropic elastic stiffness tensor and its symmetry. We demonstrate this integrated concept on a Gulf of Mexico basin model. 
Introduction
Modern seismic imaging uses tilted transverse anisotropy (TTI) and tilted orthorhombic (TOR) models to properly image and position. However, building a low-symmetry anisotropic model is a complex process as many rock parameters are needed to describe the subsurface. The relations between geomechanics stress and seismic velocity and anisotropy have been used in the past to predict seismic velocities (Bachrach and Sengupta, 2008; Rodrigues et al., 2014). Direct correlation between stress, fractures, and anisotropy (Thanoon et al., 2015; Mathewson et al., 2015) have been recently observed. However, the elastic properties of the basin are not related only to present day stress and fractures, but also to the history of the basin and the stress path experienced by the sediments. A new research area named as geophysical basin modeling (GBM) has been used to show relations between geohistory and rock properties. This research area have been branching from traditional rock physics and we believe will play a major role in using rock physics relations within their proper geological context. In this paper we present the use of geophysical basin modeling with rock physics to analyze the expected present day anisotropy and symmetry. |","rock physics, velocity,  anisotropy"

In this study, we use an example in a Barnett Shale play to demonstrate how supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques provide the right leverages for seismic interpreters. By analyzing seismic facies map generated by unsupervised self-organizing map, gamma ray estimated by artificial neural network, and brittleness index estimated by supervised proximal support vector machine, we arrive at frackability and lithofacies interpretation of the Lower Barnett Shale. We find strong agreement between interpreted frackability in the Lower Barnett Shale with microseismic events.
Introduction
Frackability, which can be measured by the brittleness index (BI) of reservoir rocks, is a key parameter of recovering unconventional shale reservoirs. In this study we use both unsupervised learning technique (self-organizing map or SOM) and supervised learning technique (proximal support vector machine or PSVM) trying to estimate BI using five petrophysical attributes. From unsupervised SOM, we cannot directly get BI from the inputs, but can have clustered lithofacies, which need to be further calibrated with other petrophysical and engineering data. From supervised PSVM, we can directly calculate BI on seismic data based on the relation obtained from a training well. Because gamma ray is a good indicator of clay minerals as well as total organic carbon (TOC) which generally make a rock ductile, we also compare the estimated BI with a gamma ray volume estimated using artificial neural network (ANN). Good virtual correlations are identified among SOM facies, BI and gamma ray volumes. The estimated BI volume is further validated by microseismic data.
The target formation in this study is the Lower Barnett Shale (Figure 1), which was deposited in the Mississippian period and dominated by silica-rich mudstones. The shale formation is bonded by Forestburg Limestone and Viola Limestone, which are considered as fracture barriers when doing hydraulic fracturing in the shale formations.
Perez and Marfurt (2014) present a workflow to estimate BI from crossplotting Lambda-Rho and Mu-Rho, which can be derived from seismic prestack simultaneous inversion. Though easy to implement, such crossplot may not sufficiently recover the highly nonlinear relation between mineralogy derived BI and seismic derived elastic properties. This motivates the authors to deploy nonlinear machine learning techniques which provides the ability to analyze data in a higher dimensional space (i.e. analyzing multiple types of data simultaneously), to discover the relation between rock frackability and seismic measurements.|","interpretation, unconventional,  nonlinear,  attributes,  reservoir characterization"

We study a polyhedral representation of regional subsurface structures partitioned into unstructured tetrahedral mesh. The geomechanics-related discontinuities are adaptively represented as triangulated interior surfaces as seperators for blocky subdomains, or “shapes”, without asssumption on smoothness. We present a two-step framework conducting mesh deformation by evolving the interior surface based on the gradient flow derived from the Hausdorff distance between an initially guessed geometry and a target polyhedral representing the true geological structure, and then elastically deforming and modifying the volume mesh under element quality constraints. We implement a series of refinement and coarsening operations, allowing topological change, and introduce a polyhedra based level set function to retrack the interior surface, as a feedback from volume modification to surface mesh optimization, which deals with the contacting and breaking up problems. |Introduction
In the full-waveform inversion (FWI) in reflection seismology, we consider a parameterization of earth structure as a piecewise smooth elastic material. The Neumann-to-Dirichlet map is considered as data, and a sparsely segmented model parameter facilitates the convergence of Landweber iteration. In the sense of sparsity, we consider a polyhedral representation of shape, that is, discontinuities in model parameters that stand for real geological structures such as fault planes, salt boundaries, ocean bottoms, sediment layers, etc. A related approach to blocky representation of geological models is found in Shin (1988), and implementation of triangular unstructured meshes can be find in Hale (2002). Such representations are initiated via segmentation using an image of material parameters as input, generating interfaces that divide subdomains. Considering the generality of geological structures, we assume no smoothness for the shape of interfaces. In general inverse problems, a piecewise constant wavespeed recovery in the finite dimenstional setting with domain partitioning is provided with a Lipschitz stability estimate in Beretta et al. (2014). Instead of recovering a continuous class of wavespeed, we hereby limit the elastic attributes to finite set of values, obtained from geological knowledge of relevant mineral types. We use a fully unstructured tetrahedral mesh with adaptive deformation, quality control, and local refinements. A hiearchical structure can be applied in determing intermediate levels of subdomains and interfaces for corresponding secondary structures. |","salt,  full-waveform inversion,  3D,  finite element"

Most seismic studies to characterize brittleness use conventional P-wave data and isotropic elastic inversion methods. However, PS-wave joint inversion and S-wave splitting methods have successfully been used to investigate shale plays as well as other unconventional resource plays. 
Anisotropic behavior related to stress direction and the geomechanics of shales has been claimed to help identify optimal drilling and stimulation locations. Also, it has been shown that use of conventional elastic parameters for characterizing “brittleness” should include anisotropic corrections to obtain proper behavior. Including PS-wave seismic data should improve anisotropy estimates and identification of potential fracture locations. 
Introduction|The ability to predict how and where fracturing is likely to occur using seismic data has become a very important area of investigation for high-grading locations for drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation. Often, horizontal well and stimulation programs based on regular patterns are only marginally productive. Identification of “brittleness” and potential fracture locations from seismic data could improve this situation by directing a more targeted drilling program.
Most seismic studies to characterize brittleness use conventional P-wave data and elastic inversion methods. Norton et al. (2010) show that conventional seismic methods of amplitude variation with offset or angle (AVO or AVA) inversion and fault mapping can estimate useful elastic properties for predicting geomechanical properties related to stimulation. They observe that hydraulically induced fracture networks prefer lower Poisson’s ratio (PR) rock in the Montney shale in NE Canada. Also, there appears to be a lack of microseismic events in the vicinity of secondary faults. 
Gray (2012) uses P-wave 3D wide-angle, wide-azimuth data to compute Young’s modulus E and Poisson’s ratio i to predict the differential horizontal stress ratio (DHSR) in the Colorado shale in Alberta, Canada. The ratio (oH-oh)/oh can be estimated from azimuthal AVA (AVAz) inversion, where oH and oh are the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses, respectively, and is a function of E and i. The azimuthal anisotropic behavior of DHSR is an indication of how the reservoir is likely to fracture. Also, he suggests that both wide-angle, wide-azimuth, conventional 3D Pwave Pwave data, and multi-component converted wave (PSwave) seismic data should allow the estimation of these parameters.|","AVO/AVA,  multicomponent, shale gas,  anisotropy"

We present results of application of stress field inversion on microseismic monitoring data. We inverted regional principal stress directions from the source mechanisms of microseismic events induced by hydraulic fracturing in a shale reservoir. We compare results of stress inversion from several groups of microseismic events and inversions. We compare inversions using source mechanisms inverted from manually picked amplitudes and automatically inverted source mechanisms. We show changes in the stress field orientation based on subset of dataset created according to observed type of source mechanisms and depth of microseismic events. The resulting stress fields are stable, highly similar and consistent with regional stress field. We get maximum regional stress in the vertical direction, which is typical for most of sedimentary basins, and maximum horizontal stress oriented approximately 75° from the direction of the drilled wells. The fact that we obtained the regional stress indicates that the regional stress determined the source mechanisms of induced microseismic events and we use Mohr diagrams to determine most likely fault planes of these events.|Introduction
Microseismic monitoring is considered to be a crucial tool for observing and mapping reservoir response to hydraulic fracture stimulation. Locations of microseismic events determine basic information about fracture geometry such as direction of fracture propagation, its length and height. Recently, an advanced fracture characterization using source mechanisms of induced microseismic events is also routinely provided (Baig and Urbancic, 2010). Locations and source mechanisms allow other advanced characterization such as discrete fracture network (Williams-Strout et al., 2010) and stress orientation.
Observed mechanisms are dominated by shearing (Stanek and Eisner, 2013; Rutledge et al. 2013). Each source mechanism of a shear event represents an (micro)earthquake with two potential fault planes and slip on these planes. According to a type of stress regime in the source area we observe different types of source mechanisms (Anderson, 1942) radiating specific directional dependent pattern of seismic waves (Aki & Richards, 1980). We use the waveforms of seismic waves to determine source mechanisms. The source mechanisms enable us to invert the most suitable stress field orientation which is consistent with the slippage on the fault planes determined from source mechanisms |","monitoring,  seismic,  microseismic, fracture stimulation,  reservoir characterization"

Due to low natural gas prices, low production rates, and increased development costs, many operators have shifted operations from shale gas to liquid-rich shale plays. One means to make shale gas plays more attractive is to enhance well production through stimulation optimization. In numerous previous works, the authors have highlighted the geomechanical causes and important parameters for hydraulic fracture optimization in naturally fractured shale plays. The authors have, for example, emphasized the impact that stress shadows, from multiple hydraulic fractures, has on increasing the resistance of natural fractures and weakness planes to shear stimulation. The authors have also shown the critical role that in-situ pressure and pressure changes have on natural fracture shear stimulation. In this paper, we present the results of a discrete element model numerical study of both hydraulic fracture spacing and hydraulic fracture timing in a fully hydro-mechanical coupled fashion. The pressure changes in the natural fracture system of an unconventional play, due to hydraulic fracturing, often follow a diffusion-type process, which means the pressure changes are time dependent. As shown in previous works of the authors and others, the time-dependent changes in the in-situ pressure can have a marked impact on shear stimulation. The study performed quantitatively looked at the impact of hydraulic fracture spacing as a function of in-situ pressure change and time for key parameters such as the in-situ stress ratio, natural fracture characteristics, and natural fracture mechanical properties. The results of the study help improve the understanding of in-situ pressure and hydraulic fracture timing on stimulation optimization and enhanced hydrocarbon production. The study also provides a means to optimize hydraulic fracture spacing and increase shear stimulation for unconventional wells.
Introduction
Advances in horizontal drilling resulted in a shale-gas boom since the 1990s, as horizontal drilling allows for many hydraulic fractures to be created along a single horizontal well (King, 2010). Due to the injection of fracture fluid, for creating the fracture, and proppant to keep the fracture open permanently, both pore pressure and stress distribution are altered around the hydraulic fracture. A key factor in successful hydraulic fracturing for unconventionals is shear stimulation around the fracture. While the stress shadow stabilizes natural fractures, increasing pressure within the natural fractures and weakness planes decreases the effective stresses, which results in increasing the possibility of shear slippage and shear stimulation.|","fractures,  fracture stimulation, fluid,  unconventional,  elastic"

The benefits of hydraulic fracturing horizontal wells in unconventional reservoirs for production enhancement are evident; however, the best methods to truly increase recovery efficiency through these stimulations are still under great examination. Analogous to how operators and service companies discovered that Barnett-style slickwater treatments were not successful in all reservoirs, companies are beginning to recognize the importance of engineered stimulations, specifically in regard to geomechanics. Rather than perforating for only production purposes, hydraulic fracturing design has now turned its focus to perforating for reservoir rock stimulation. Enhanced fracture network complexity through induced fractures greatly increases the contact area and reservoir drainage for maximum productivity. However, to accomplish the stimulation of both primary and secondary fracture networks, the coupled behaviors of geomechanics and fluid flow in response to the hydraulic fracturing operations must be considered. This paper details the development of a coupled geomechanics and fluid flow model for the purpose of hydraulic fracture design optimization through the evaluation of different stimulation patterns. The patterns under consideration include the Zipper, Texas Two-Step, and Modified Zipper designs. Furthermore within these patterns, the well locations and hydraulic fracture properties are analyzed to determine the most ideal design for a shale oil reservoir based on recovery efficiency and generated fracture complexity.
As a result of this study, it was found that with the staggered fracture placement offered by the Modified Zipper Pattern, a highly conductive secondary complex fracture network is generated allowing for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. In comparison to the Zipper and Texas Two-Step Patterns, the Modified Zipper Pattern reduces the stress anisotropy within the formation to a much greater extent, aiding in the fracture generation process to increase the flow area. This advantage coupled with its high oil recovery factor and potential for greater drilling density discerns the Modified Zipper as the ideal pattern for the development of an Eagle Ford-type shale oil reservoir. |","modeling,  horizontal wells, fracture stimulation,  fractures"

Current paradigm asserts the impossibility of unambiguous estimation of full moment tensors from three-component microseismic data recorded in a single straight borehole. The statement of inversion nonuniqueness, related to the lack of illumination of the off-plane moment component in the zero solidangle ray apertures, tacitly assumes the slowness vectors, normal to the relevant wave fronts, to be confined to the plane containing the ray trajectories. Although such arrangements of the rays and slownesses do take place for vertical wells drilled in horizontally layered isotropic and VTI (transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis) formations, azimuthal anisotropy commonly expected for hydraulically fractured shales makes the slowness vectors deviate from a plane, arrange themselves into nonzero solid-angle apertures, and yield theoretically unique inverse problems for seismic moment tensors. This paper examines those problems for the anisotropy parameters characterizing fractured shales and siltstones in the Bakken. Their strong azimuthal anisotropy entails not only formally unique but, importantly for practical applications, well-posed inverse problems, resulting in robust estimates of the complete moment tensors from singleborehole data.
Introduction
Focal mechanisms of microseismic events triggered in the course of hydraulic stimulations of unconventional reservoirs contain information usefully complementing the event hypocenters and magnitudes. The value of this information lies in revealing important details of rock failure, such as the orientations of fractures along which the rock breaks, the directions of slips occurring at those fractures, and the relative portions of the double couple, the compensated linear vector dipole, and the isotropic source components..
Estimation of full seismic moment tensor, containing six independent elements (Aki and Richards, 1980; Shearer, 2009), relies on the measurements of vectorial amplitudes of the P- and often S-waves excited by a microseismic event or on certain attributes extracted from the amplitudes (e.g., Julian, 1986; Julian and Foulger, 1996). All six moment components cannot be constrained in a unique fashion in the farfield range from a source when rays and slowness vectors of waves used for the moment tensor inversion (MTI) are confined to a plane. This theoretical assertion, first discovered for isotropy (Nolen-Hoeksema and Ruff, 2001) and then extended to vertical monitor wells in horizontally stratified media composed of either isotropic or VTI layers (Vavry?cuk, 2007), has led to a commonly held belief that unambiguous MTI is impossible for ray apertures characterized by the zero solid angles (e.g., Baig and Urbancic, 2010; Leaney et al., 2011; Stan?ek and Eisner, 2013; Song et al., 2014) unless seismic data are recorded in the source near field (Song and Toks<U+00A8>oz, 2011). Acting upon this perception, the industry currently employs two distinct data-acquisition geometries for carrying out full seismic MTI: wide-aperture surface arrays instrumented with vertical (Duncan and Eisner, 2010; Auger et al., 2013) or three-component (3C) geophones (Birkelo et al., 2012), or arrays of 3C receivers placed in multiple wells (Baig and Urbancic, 2010; Maxwell et al., 2010).|","anisotropy,  microseismic"

Accurate reservoir characterization is an important factor to constrain a three dimensional geomechanical model for simulation of hydraulic fracturing and prediction of the microseismic response. Inversions on 3D seismic data can be used to image local heterogeneities in the stress field, elastic modulus, and variations in the discrete fracture network which will have a profound effect on the temporal and spatial complexity of the hydraulic fracture treatment. Once calibrated, a geomechanical fracture network model constrained by seismic attributes can be used to optimize various well, completion and stimulation scenarios. Using a published reservoir characterization case study as an input to a geomechanical model, a number of scenarios are investigated including: landing point locations for optimal reservoir contact, well geometry and the estimation of fracture propagation along with its corresponding microseismicity. These geomechanical models can be used as a predictive engineering tool leveraging reservoir characterization data for improved hydraulic fracture effectiveness, hence extending the value of the 3D seismic data for unconventional reservoirs. 
Introduction
Unconventional reservoir development typically utilizes multiple, evenly spaced, parallel wells with identical engineering plans of uniformly spaced hydraulic fracture stages. However, 3D seismic often shows significant reservoir heterogeneity, including geohazards and variations in rock properties and stratigraphy. Microseismic imaging of hydraulic fractures also often shows significant variation in the hydraulic fracture geometry. Ultimate production and recovery rates from apparently similarly engineered wells can also be dramatically different, suggesting that the common engineering practice of standardized design is poorly suited to the geological heterogeneity of unconventional reservoirs. Potentially better reservoir characterization can be used to tailor the engineering design to local conditions.
Gray et al., (2012), analyze 3D seismic data to estimate geomechanical and stress parameters within a reservoir, and describe the application of reservoir characterization for improvement in decisions of drilling wells and hydraulic fracture stimulation. This pioneering work transforms 3D seismic into engineering input parameters such as mechanical properties, stresses and associated fracture breakdown pressures to qualitatively interpret the expected hydraulic fracture variability. In order to transform such reservoir characterization information into a complete engineering tool, a method is required to quantitatively predict the hydraulic fracture variation within this reservoir heterogeneity framework. A geomechanical simulation of hydraulic fracture networks is a way of integrating discrete fracture networks, reservoir elastic and stress properties from 3D seismic to model expected hydraulic fracture characteristics and ultimately predict the expected microseismic response. The geomechanical modeling to follow can reconcile the geological model with engineering injection data and microseismicity for a unified interpretation of the hydraulic fracture. |","fracture stimulation,  reservoir characterization,  microseismic, modeling"

Stimulation treatments in Saudi Arabian gas reservoirs were initiated in 1998. Since then, stimulation gradually became the preferred technology to improve gas production and sustainability. Different technologies have been applied over the years, and only the best of them survived the test of time. Advances in completion technologies enabled drilling horizontal wells and completing them with multistage stimulation completions in either openhole (OH) or cased hole wellbores. The new generation of stimulation software allowed comprehensive modeling of hydraulic fracturing in a 3D reservoir simulation software platform. Advances in logging technologies allowed better estimation of rock mechanical properties, a major input for the fracturing design software. Channel fracturing technology mitigated the risk of screenout in proppant fracturing and enabled placing fractures with nearly infinite conductivity that helped in faster cleanup of the well and improved production. The new dualcrosslinked fracturing fluid provided a reliable solution for high-pressure/ high-temperature (HPHT) reservoirs that can sustain very high shear degradation.

Qatargas Operating Company Limited (QATARGAS) has executed a major debottlenecking of its existing facilities at QATARGAS 1. This Project is known as the Plateau Maintenance Project (PMP). Its purpose is to maintain the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) production, while coping with increased levels of H2S and CO2 in the inlet feed gas streams. Revamp of LNG trains adds new pretreatment AGRU, upstream of the existing gas sweetening facilities an additional Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) and Tail Gas Treatment unit (TGTU). 
This paper details the challenges of the PMP project which involves the construction of an additional Acid Gas Removal Unit (AGRU) treating in a single train 1,100 MMSCFD of natural gas, an associated Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) and Tail Gas Treatment Unit (TGTU) within the minimum plot area allocated to the green field part of the Project. It focuses on the AGRU with integrated amine section of TGTU which was considered as the most effective solution to install a new compact plant inside the existing facilities of QATARGAS 1 LNG plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. 
The design selected by QATARGAS after an international bidding phase uses the AdvAmine™ MDEAmax technology based on open market MDEA solvent. This reliable and original design features a fully integrated AGRU + TGTU amine section unit that meets multiple process requirements with high operational flexibility: jointly to H2S and CO2 removal specifications assigned to the 1,100 MMSCFD inlet gas, the plant cleans up the H2S from tail gas installed downstream the new 880 tpd SRU to meet the environmental emissions regulation.

In Kuwait's largest reservoir, the Burgan Field, exploration wells have large potential for drilling optimization and savings; specifically a 22 inch hole, that is drilled conventionally using multiple roller cone bits in multiple trips through challenging inter-bedded formations. Hybrid drill bit technology, roller cone combined with Polycrystalline Diamond Compact, was introduced in search for an economically viable solution to deliver wells faster and achieve yearly operator targets. This paper analyzes the breakthrough drilling performance achieved by a 22 inch hybrid bit in comparison to conventional roller cones offsets and provides conclusions on economic viability. 
The main challenges drilling the 22 inch section are drill bit durability and drilling vibrations through inter-bedded formation layers of limestone, shale and sandstone. In addition to curing fluid losses in certain porous formations that negatively affect Rate Of Penetration (ROP). Typically two roller cone bits are used on rotary drive to drill this section at 15 feet per hour, consuming seven drilling days. Using Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bit with a performance motor to increase ROP performance is not an economically viable solution. Using hybrid drill bit on rotary drive combines the benefits of PDC blades' durability and higher cutting efficiency with the cones' stability by grinding and gouging into the formation. 
The deployment of the hybrid technology was a collaboration project between a national oil company and a major oil services company. The teams focused on optimizing the complete drilling system including the bottom hole assembly, hydraulics, drilling parameters and geological factors to match the hybrid drill bit mechanism. 
The hybrid design selection and drilling optimization resulted in a 142-percent ROP improvement from offsets average performance. The hybrid designs consistently drilled the 22 inch hole after casing shoe to section total depth at 31 feet per hour, using one bit, in three drilling days in comparison to seven days average performance. The total operator savings from e section was approximately USD 175,000 in the first deployment. The second and third deployments established performance consistency. Such remarkable economical savings and technical optimization proved that the hybrid technology is the viable solution for two prolific exploration applications.|","Breakthrough Performance, Savings Rig Days, Engineering Design Optimization, Hybrid Technology, Technology Deployments"

Filter cakes are the key to maximizing return permeability and preventing formation damage. Typical considerations of filtercake properties include thickness, toughness, and slickness; however, a filter cake's structure, particle size distribution, texture, and invasion into the formation are also essential factors that can affect the production of oil or gas in a reservoir. This study was conducted to investigate filter cakes and its interactions with rocks through petrographic studies. The filter cakes were created via return permeability tests using actual reservoir or replaced cores. The information and data gathered increases understanding of the damage mechanism a fluid can have on the reservoir. 
Our data demonstrates that an improperly sized bridging package, filter-cake compactness, filter-cake invasion, and the inability for a filter cake to create flow channels are key factors that significantly affect return permeability results. Undersized bridging particles can cause filter-cake invasion, permanently block pores within the formation, and limit production flow. Highly compacted filter cakes composed of fine-grained material could act as a barrier between the formation and the wellbore, which can result in a deceased return permeability measurement. Furthermore, filter-cake structures and homogeneity can indicate reservoir drill-in fluid (RDF) stability. Particle separation, according to grain size and/or density, in the drilling fluid can lead to graded particles within the filter cake; this can also ultimately affect production flow.|","mud, filtercake, microstructural, cake, filter"

In the past decade, Fiber-Optic (FO) based sensing has opened up opportunities for in-well reservoir surveillance in the oil and gas industry. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) has been used in applications such as steam front monitoring in thermal development projects and injection conformance monitoring in waterflood development projects using warmback analysis and FO-based pressure gauges are deployed commonly. In recent years significant progress has also been made to mature other, new FO-based surveillance methods such as the application of Distributed Strain Sensing (DSS) for monitoring reservoir compaction and well deformation, multidrop Distributed Pressure Sensing (DPS) for fluid level determination, and Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) for geophysical and production/injection profiling. For the latter application, numerous field surveys were conducted to develop evaluation algorithms to convert the DAS noise recordings into flow rates from individual zones. 
In this paper we present an overview of recent advances in FO-based methods such as DAS, DTS, and DSS for the application of production and injection surveillance. From field examples acquired by Shell and its affiliates it is clear that FO-based flow monitoring provides a powerful addition to the standard surveillance toolkit and in some cases is even the preferred way of surveillance because of its unique advantages.|","fibre optic sensing, Distributed Acoustic Sensing, Well and reservoir surveillance, in-well flow monitoring"

Over the last 60 years in the oil and gas industry, lost circulation has been the major nonproductive time (NPT) issue worldwide during well construction (12% of total NPT). According to industry figures, more than USD 2 billion are spent combating circulation loss each year. In the Rumaila field of Iraq, the NPT due to lost circulation is significant, estimated to be 46% of the total NPT recorded. 
The Rumaila oil field is a super-giant oil field in southern Iraq; the field is estimated to contain 17 billion barrels, which accounts for 12% of Iraq's oil reserves. In the Rumaila field, at least 45% of the wells experience severe to total circulation loss at depths of 450 to 650 m true vertical depth (TVD) while drilling in the karst facies of the Dammam formation. Numerous strategies, requiring up to 24 days of rig time or 15 cement plugs in some extreme cases, have been applied by different service companies without consistent results. This has resulted in higher operating costs and delayed production. Some of the identified reasons for the low success rate are poor wellbore characterization, weak assessment of the problem, and improper execution. 
The foundation of the proposed engineering and operational approach is the characterization of the wellbore with the caliper and formation image logs for better understanding of fractures and estimation of fracture volume. The approach also includes two cement slurry-type options—an increased slurry rheology with reduced density and a slurry with rapid gel strength development. The proposed approach is made complete with the engineered estimation of cement slurry volume, based on loss rate, and proper field deployment. 
Developed on the basis of previous experiences and optimization of hydrostatic pressure, cement slurry rheology, and gel strength development, the engineered lost circulation solution significantly improves the lost circulation control results. Extended evaluation of cement plug jobs with the engineered design and proper execution has proven the effective impact of the solution, curing losses during the drilling phase (<3 days). This solution has proven to be an effective and key element, contributing to the increased success rate of the subsequent primary cementing operation and overcoming the challenges of zonal isolation.|","Lost Circulation"

During the evolution of technology to successfully produce shale reservoirs, a term called Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) was introduced. Since then, several authors made efforts to identify, characterize or optimize the stimulated reservoir volume. However, as current literature holds, only a few attempts have been made to summarize and analyze all these contributions. The purpose of this work is to discuss SRV, its different concepts and calculation methodologies to diminish the uncertainty and improve the understanding on unconventional hydrocarbon production. 
Several techniques are discussed from literature that calculates different volumes, their names and their time-frame scope of analysis that can go from microseismic observation to stimulation to rate transient analysis to numerical simulation. Differentiation between stimulated volume and producing area is also discussed. A discussion over created fractures and the inherited debate over fracture height and brittleness are investigated. Finally, it is reviewed the changes during and after refracturing of maximum horizontal stress, permeability, conductivity and fracture dimensions and it is impact in SRV. 
Based data from several hydraulic fractured wells, our observations suggest an effective improvement in the prediction of permeability distribution if more than one SRV concept is applied analyzed at different time intervals. Also results reflects the fact that micro seismic aids SRV characterization as an effective tool. Another observation for improved production is the importance of mobility for shale gas and shale oil that requires creating fracture complexity for the former to be more productive and planar fracture for the latter. 
This work delivers a synopsis of several standpoints about Stimulated Reservoir Volume towards a better identification of optimum lateral length location, orientation and proppant volume. This fundamental review will aid reservoir, completion and stimulation engineers on the understanding of the factors that contribute to successful production from unconventional shale reservoirs.|","Stimulated Reservoir Volume, rate transient analysis, microseismic, hydraulic fracture, numerical simulation"

Much of the hydrocarbon reserves are stored in fractured reservoirs with high heterogeneity worldwide. In such reservoirs there likely exists more than two porosity types, and transient flow likely occurs in the matrix. Dual porosity models can characterize only two porosity types and are difficult to accurately capture the transient flow. This paper discusses an advanced model that allows simulating an arbitrary number of porosity types which accurately captures the transient flow in the matrix. 
The proposed multiple porosity model honors any number of porosity types with different properties, such as permeability, porosity and wettability. Arbitrary connection for intra-porosity and inter-porosity flow are designed in an unstructured scheme, and convenient transformation between multiple porosity and multiple permeability formulations is allowed. A flexible porosity subdivision works in a fashion of hierarchical refinement and allows us to characterize the transient flow in the matrix and multilevel fracture sets with different geometry as well. The formulation is designed to allow the proposed scheme to be generalized. To quantify the improvement available with the new formulation, multiple porosity models are compared with single porosity models and analysis of different shape factors are also conducted. Our results show that they can be made to be equivalent under single phase conditions. Moreover, the application of the new model in shale reservoirs is discussed in two phase flow cases considering mixed wettability in shale matrix, and the results show that through a complete inter-porosity connection mode, the flow pathway of gas and water in shale is effectively identified.|","Fractured Reservoirs, Porosity Subdivision, Transient Flow, Reservoir Simulation, Multiple Porosity/Permeability"

A detailed geomechanical study has been performed for a tight field in the Sultanate of Oman. This study included computation of fracture initiation pressure (FIP) applying the boundary element method (BEM) and maximal tensile stress (MTS) criterion using 3D numerical modeling. The goal of the present work is to numerically simulate the effects of wellbore completion type on FIP with arbitrary wellbore position and finding the conditions that correspond to the lowest FIP. The model is based on the BEM. Since the equations and correlations are not empirical and not field-specific, the model is applicable to a wide range of conditions. The data used for this project were from different zones and blocks of a tight gas-bearing sandstone field in the Sultanate of Oman. The amount and quality of available data allowed comprehensive model development. The model is built for the four blocks of the main field, but can be applied to the other blocks and fields. Two horizontal wells parallel to each other 400 m apart have been recently completed with different completion types, which allowed reasonable comparison of actual and modeled breakdown pressures for open and cased holes. Two vertical wells in different blocks have been completed with openhole sections with subsequent placement of hydraulic fractures. Discussion on the effectiveness of this completion type over the typically used cased and cemented completions in regards to breakdown pressure and overall well efficiency is provided.

In order to develop an inhibitive water-based mud capable of mitigating the adverse effects of shale-mud interactions, it is important to characterize the shale sample in terms of its geological structure, mineralogical composition, reactivity potential, etc. Further, the shale-mud interactions should be studied through a series of experimental tests such as swelling, dispersion and inhibition durability. 
This paper presents the results of characterization and testing of one of the studied shale samples with X-ray diffraction, micro-CT, ultrasonic rock mechanics testing, capillary suction time and cation exchange capacity. The paper also shows how petrophysics data of shale formations can be utilized to improve and optimize drilling practices in order to achieve the ultimate goal of enhanced wellbore stability. Depending on clay content, different shale formations have different responses when exposed to drilling fluids. It is therefore very important to characterize the shale formation to develop the appropriate drilling fluid. 
The tested shale sample was found to be a silica-rich shale with a small percentage of clay minerals, mainly kaolinite. Characterization scheme included also Micro-CT where the images revealed the heterogeniety and fractures in the internal matrix. Dynamic elastic moduli were determined using ultrasonic rock mechanics testing.

Assessing the mechanisms of compaction and their effect on transport properties using digital core analysis necessitates the use of small samples to achieve the required resolution for the calculation of petrophysical properties. In this case boundary effects can be substantial and a direct comparison with experiment is only warranted if the boundary effects are included in the simulation. Here we develop a workflow to define regions within the sample where these boundary effects are minimized. We concentrate in particular on sleeve leakage and use a radial partitioning of the solutions of the transport equations to derive measures free of boundary effects, which may be used for the development of petrophysical cross-correlations. 
We use samples of Bentheimer and Castlegate sandstone as well as Mt Gambier limestone and a sucrosic dolomite. Plugs with diameters between 5mm and 7mm are cut and placed into a purpose-build tri-axial cell on a micro-CT rotation stage. The plugs are surrounded radially by a sleeve separating confining fluid from the samples and axially by fluid distribution heads made of steel which also supply the axial load. We consider hydrostatic confinement and acquire images at low confining pressure. Using the high-resolution images we calculate transport properties, electrical conductivity and permeability to flow, numerically on the samples at full plug scale. We include the sleeve boundary in the calculation, which was segmented out separately to allow matching exactly the experimental boundary conditions. The resulting flux fields are used to locally calculate the fluxes in different regions of interest. We consider partitions of the pore space based on topological distance (pores) and geometric distance with regard to the sleeve boundary. This allows calculating intrinsic fluxes as function of sleeve distance to characterize the radial dependency of transport properties across the core. 
We observe clear fluid bypassing at the sleeve-sample interface for all samples. For the less consolidated samples (e.g. Castlegate sandstone), core damage at the outer rim is also evident, since the radial dependency shows first a maximum at the sleeve boundary, but then a minimum before stabilizing at larger sleeve distances. This is likely due to compaction from drilling the sample. In addition to the transport properties we also report the porosity as function of sleeve distance for all samples. The leakage observed for the transport properties along the sleeve boundary correlates well with the radial porosity variation for all samples.|","image processing, formation factor, micro-CT, permeability, lattice Boltzmann"

In the absence of strong diagenetic or compaction trends, the anisotropy and distribution of facies and petrophysical properties are essentially the result of the composition of the paleoenvironment at the time of deposition and of geological phenomena such as erosion, faulting, and folding, which subsequently altered the geometry of the rocks. Understanding and isolating these two parameters (depositional and post-depositional effects) is key to the accurate interpolation and extrapolation of subsurface properties. This requires establishing a mathematical transform between the present-day geometry of rocks and their geometry at the time of deposition. The most common solution consists in relying on the layering and indexing of 3D grids to approximate paleodepositional coordinates. However, it is shown that for both pillar and stair-step grids in presence of tight folds or low-dipping or reverse faults, the variogram ranges, orientations, and facies proportions are significantly distorted when geostatistics are based on cell indexing. 
Four essential properties that a rigorous depositional space should honor are then described and the shortcomings of the existing solutions are analyzed. A novel approach in which the representation of a depositional space is independent of a 3D reservoir grid is then introduced, and it is shown that solid mechanics provide a robust and practical way of building such a computational space. The use of depositional coordinates for performing variogram analysis and property interpolation is also exposed. The proposed approach yields facies distributions that accurately honor the model parameters independently from the structural configuration, while accounting for complex stratigraphic and depositional patterns (erosions, onlaps, etc.) and integrating nondepositional trends and overprints. We demonstrate that, in a variety of geological settings, better results are obtained when property interpolation and simulation do not rely on grid geometry and indexing.|","Grid, Geostatistics, Depositional, Variogram, Modeling"

Wellbore stability and formation damage are of great interest and significance in drilling industry. It is estimated, each year, millions of dollars are lost due to wellbore instability problems which are resulting from exposure of shale to drilling muds. The main objective of this research activity is to improve shale inhibition and wellbore stability by using Silica nanoparticles in mud formulation. Furthermore, it is also intended to use this nanoadditive as a multifunctional mud additive to decrease fluid loss, improve lubricity, avoid shale swelling and modify rheological properties. In order to achieve these objectives, experimental procedures have been planned in the following sequences; A) Different concentrations of Silica nanoparticles are used in conducting experiments in order to determine the nanoparticles concentration range that yields the optimum shale inhibition. B) Further experiments are conducted on the evaluation of rheological properties and fluid loss via API standard methods. C) Lubricity and shale swelling tests are performed via relevant standards. D) Overall evaluation of laboratory-prepared water based drilling fluid is performed and the results are presented and compared with the blank samples. In conclusion, according to the acquired results including nanoadditives in drilling fluid and comparing them with blank samples, it was found that the most economical and effective concentration of nanoparticles is below 1% w/v, which lead to an acceptable shale inhibition effects by plugging the nanosized pores. These effects are analyzed and reported graphically. Various charts and figures show the enhancement in rheological properties such as yield point by adding small amount of nanoadditive in comparison with ordinary vicosifiers in drilling fluids. The most significant achievement in this research is the cost effectiveness of the nanoadditive. Not only can we improve mud performance with a lower cost in comparison with previously used drilling additives, but also by further modifications, these additives can replace the ordinary drilling additives. Needless to say that such change has a considerable reduction in drilling fluids costs. Several works have accomplished in relation with applying Silica nanoparticles in drilling fluid formulation and approximately in all of these works, only higher concentrations of nanoparticles (more than 10%wt) can be applicable in the shadow of surfactants and ultrasonication methods for sufficient dispersion. The striking feature of this research is the consuming of nanoparticles in lower concentrations (maximum 1% w/v) and without the assistance of surfactants.|","Nanotechnology, Shale Stability, Shale Inhibition, Nano Drilling Fluids, Nano SiO2"

While extensive data and experiences are available for hydraulic fracturing and hydrocarbon production from shales in the U.S.A., such a record is lacking in many underexplored shale basins worldwide. As limited data is usually available in these basins, analysis of shale prospectivity and identification of sweet spots for oil & gas production needs to be based on upfront geological characterization and modelling before drilling, hydraulic fracturing and gas production has commenced. In this paper, different reservoir characterization techniques and modelling approaches are combined to quantify key performance indicators that describe potential shale productivity across the formation. The performance indicators describe the potential for hydrocarbon generation, storage, and flow stimulation based on a limited number of shale properties, and are benchmarked using data from the prospective Barnett Shale Formation in the U.S.A. The approach has been applied to the underexplored Posidonia Shale Formation in the South of the Netherlands (West Netherlands Basin). Local maxima of the mean performance indicator across the formation correlate with local maxima in vitrinite reflectance and depth. Average performance for the Posidonia is lower than for the Barnett shale, mainly due to lower maturity and brittleness. Besides higher clay content and associated lower brittleness, the potential for hydrocarbon generation and storage capacity of the Posidonia are comparable to oil mature Barnett shale from noncore areas. Predictions of gas production in the Posidonia based on simulations of hydraulic fracturing and gas flow using well-based models are in rough agreement with gas production observed in noncore Barnett areas, but low brittleness may hamper succesfull hydraulic fracturing. The example shows that the approach can be applied to underexplored shales worldwide to quantify prospectivity, map out sweet spots, point to preferred drilling sites, and optimize field development planning.|","underexplored shale basins, key performance indicators, hydraulic fracturing, sweet spots shales, basin modelling"

The realism of modeling well stimulation by hydraulic fracturing, in 3D reservoir grids, heavily depends on the match between the predicted multiple-scale discrete-fracture-network (DFN) and its flow properties, versus the monitored fractures at drilled rocks. Unfortunately, monitoring the hydraulic fracturing phenomena and connectivity of DFNs at multiple scales is highly uncertain. Although fracture orientation and location are measurable at wellbores, and microseismic has contributed to characterize hydraulic fracture geometry; the subseismic connectivity of hydraulic and natural fractures with sweet-spot rock-bodies at larger distances demands advanced integration of preexisting structural features into numerical models. Therefore, modern fracture optimization demands the use of 3D stochastic reservoir models. Additionally, mismatches between the reality and the model are incidentally observed by comparing bottomhole pressure and multiphase flowrate response in flow models versus downhole monitored data. Attempting to recreate the fracturing process requires coupling hydraulic injection, fracturing geomechanics, proppant transport, and flow under preexisting structural uncertainty; at multiple scales. Although tools for modeling such a complex workflow exist, results do not automatically match microseismic or other advanced observations, due to preexisting structural uncertainty in the model, and/or limitations of the tools themselves. 
In this paper, the importance of multiple-scale structural-heterogeneity is emphasized, and the use of ""practical"" inverse problem solutions of DFN models is suggested for its characterization. The proposed inverse approach is to modify structural object positions, attitudes, and geometries, instead of upscaled flow properties. An industrial scale example of such approach, where the size of pseudo-compartments is controlled by subseismic sealing faults, is recalled. Errors in pressure response are correlated to fracture displacements along normal vectors. The use of streamline simulation to facilitate tomography of DFN intensity is evoked. The multistage fracking process is also proposed to be handled with the same approach, modifying the geomechanical fracture model to match monitored flow and proppant transport response. Finally, novelties for monitoring proppant transport during fracturing are also highlighted.|","Nonstationary modeling, Multiscale Flow, Structural heterogeneity, Resources, Uncertainty assessment"

The ExxonMobil Drilling Advisory System (DAS™) is a rig-based drilling surveillance and optimization platform that encourages regular (guided) drill-off tests, carefully monitors drilling performance and provides recommendations for controllable drilling parameters to help improve the overall drilling process. It is well known that drilling with dysfunction(s), such as BHA whirl or bit stick-slip, among others, can damage drilling tools, lead to poor borehole quality and result in significant reductions in Rate of Penetration (ROP). The ultimate objective of DAS is to help drillers achieve consistently better and longer bit runs by identifying and mitigating drilling dysfunctions. 
In this paper we describe the DAS workflow, provide an overview of many of the key technical components of DAS and summarize results from several recent field applications. The DAS workflow includes a learning (or calibration) mode that encourages the driller to explore different operating parameters by conducting drill-off tests, which in turn allows the system to build an understanding of performance trends. This understanding is then exploited by an application mode which leverages results obtained during the learning (or calibration) phase. The workflow is iteratively applied in real-time as drilling operations and geological conditions change. 
Key technical components of the DAS application include: high quality adaptive filtering algorithms for computing various drilling system performance measures (e.g., MSE, ROP, and stick-slip severity, among others), data encapsulation/dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e., the notion of ""response points"") and reduced order modeling techniques (simplices, smooth response surfaces, etc.) which are ultimately used to generate recommendations for improved performance. 
Using examples from recent offshore field applications, we illustrate the use of adaptive filtering and data encapsulation to process noisy real-time data and extract meaningful trends to enable drilling performance optimization. We show how fitting response surfaces to response points can help elucidate, in real-time, the occurrence of classical drilling dysfunctions such as lateral vibrations (as manifest in increased MSE) and stick-slip torsional vibrations. Using results from recent applications of DAS to unconventional pad-drilling operations, we show the impacts of focused drilling performance limiter redesign and real-time DAS parameter changes on improved overall ROP in subsequent wells on a pad.|","Advisory Systems, Drilling, Mechanical Specific Energy, Real-time, Optimization"

Yucel, Texas A&M University","|Summary |Measured permeability of an organic-rich shale sample varies significantly with applied laboratory conditions, such as the confining pressure, temperature, and the measurement fluid type. This indicates that the measured quantity is influenced by several mechanisms that add complexity to the measurement. The complexity is mainly caused by stress dependence of the matrix permeability. Also, it is because organic-rich shale holds significant volumes of fluids in sorbed (adsorbed, dissolved) states; sorption can also influence the permeability through its own storage and transport mechanisms. The stress-dependence and sorption effects on permeability could develop under the reservoir conditions and influence the production, although we currently do not have a predictive permeability model that considers their coexistence. |In this work, this is accomplished by considering that the shale matrix consists of multiple continua with organic and inorganic pores. Stress dependency of the permeability comes along with slit-shaped pores, whereas the sorption effects are associated with nanscale organic capillaries. A simple conceptual flow model with an apparent shale permeability is developed that couples the molecular-transport effects of the sorbed phase with the stress dependence of the slit-shaped pores. The simulation results show the impact of the permeability model on the production. |Sensitivity analysis on the new permeability model shows that the stress dependence of the overall transport is significant at high pore pressure, when the effective stress is relatively low. Diffusive molecular transport of the sorbed phase becomes important as the stress gets larger and, hence, the slit-shaped pores close. The constructed apparent-permeability vs. pore-pressure curves show the dominance of the molecular transport as an increase in permeability characterized by appearance of a minimum permeability value at the intermediate values of the pressure. One can use the new permeability model easily in history matching a well performance and optimizing its production.|","pore diffusion, sorbed phase transport, stress dependent permeability"

In general, caprock-integrity assessments include caprock geological studies, in-situ stress determination, constitutive-property characterization, and numerical simulations, which allow operators to ensure that steam-injection pressure does not cause any risk to the confinement of steam chambers. The aim of this study is to identify and provide the representative parameters that can enhance understanding of the geotechnical behaviour of the Alberta Clearwater formation clay shale. Moreover, it illustrates how the results can be used to extract constitutive model parameters for modelling the behaviour of this class of material. The parameters are also used for complex reservoir-geomechanical simulation for caprock integrity. These parameters are also compared with other Cretaceous clay-shale counterparts in North America.|","Petroleum Geomechanics"

Generally known as wellbore strengthening, this technique often helps the operator to drill with higher mud gradients compared with that suggested by the conventional fracture-gradient or borehole-fracture-limit analysis. The underlying mechanisms through which a wellbore is strengthened, however, are not yet fully understood. |This study explores these wellbore-strengthening mechanisms through an analytical solution to the related solid-mechanics model of the wellbore and its adjacent fractures. The provided solution is generic in that it takes into account the mechanical interaction of multiple fractures between one another and the wellbore under an arbitrary state of in-situ stress anisotropy. An additional generality in this solution arises from its unification and quantification of some solid-mechanics aspects of the previous hypotheses that have been published on the subject—i.e., stress cage, as well as the tip isolation and its effect on the fracture-propagation resistance. |In relation to the stress-cage theory, the study investigates the wellbore-hoop-stress enhancement upon fracturing. The findings indicate that the induced hoop stress is significant at some regions near the wellbore, especially in the general vicinity of the fracture(s). However, given the strong dependency of wellbore stress on the mechanical and geometrical parameters of the problem, generalizing these results to the entire region around the wellbore may not always be trivial. The study also examines tip isolation, a common feature of fracture-closure and propagation-resistance hypotheses, through the analysis of partially reduced fracture pressures and a breakdown criterion, defined by the critical stress-intensity factor of the formation rock.|","Mud Weight Window, Wellbore Stress , Lost Circulation Material, Fracture Mechanics"

The Horn River shale-gas play is a world-class unconventional gas resource and is being exploited by use of multistage hydraulic fracturing along horizontal wells. The two well pads, Pad-1 and Pad-2, selected for this study comprise eight and seven horizontal wells, respectively, with 1 to 7 years of production history. Numerical modelling of shale reservoirs has historically been a problematic low-confidence exercise because of the difficulties associated with inadequate characterization of the geologic framework of shale plays; the problems of estimating the properties of induced-fracture networks; and the complexities of capturing multiphase flow in fracture networks and wellbores during production, especially in the face of offset-well activity. This paper provides insights into these issues. |The geoscience modelling activity begins with integrating information from cores, well logs, petrophysical analyses, and seismic data into a 3D geocellular model. At first, the model is built upon a simple lithostratigraphic concept, which is the basis of the numerical-flow-modelling exercise of Pad-1. The 3D geocellular model is thereafter thoroughly reworked to incorporate a sequence-stratigraphic perspective to the Horn River shale. This reworked geocellular model has a profound impact on the dynamic modelling of Pad-2. Also, hydraulic conductivity of induced and natural fractures is measured on Horn River core plugs at reservoir conditions to constrain conductivity values assigned to primary, secondary, and tertiary flow paths into dynamic reservoir modelling. |As a result of the integrated work flow, we have achieved a history match allowing us to further understand the hydraulic-fracturing behaviour and its impact on producing shale reservoirs of the Horn River formation. On the basis of the findings, we recommend targeting the Evie and Otter Park shale reservoirs for landing horizontal wells and multistage fracturing when the Carbonate Fan is thin; this approach can produce all three compartmentalized shale reservoirs of the Horn River formation. Ultimately, the objective of any reservoir modelling project is to provide a range of reliable forecast of future performance that is grounded in representative geoscience interpretations and that takes operational constraints into account. The technical learnings described in this work will be helpful to further understand hydraulic-fracturing behaviour and its impact on producing shale reservoirs.|","Shale Reservoir, Reservoir Simulation, Multi-Well Pad, Geoscience, Hydraulic Fracturing"

Previous studies have demonstrated that shear or nonuniform deformation and stress redistribution in subsurface formations may have significant effects on reservoir fluid flows. Thus, a two-way coupled analysis is the required approach under circumstances where the shear deformation or changes in total stresses in the reservoir cannot be neglected. |A coupled multiphysics simulator is developed for the dynamic modeling of multiphase thermal/compositional flow, and poroelasto-plastic geomechanical deformation. The equations that govern multiphase flow in permeable media, heat transport, and poroelasto-plastic geomechanics together lead to a highly nonlinear system. Finite-volume and Galerkin finite-element methods are used for the numerical solution of thermal/compositional multiphase fluid-flow and geomechanics equations on general hexahedral grids, respectively. Because of its improved stability and rapid convergence characteristics, the resulting multiphysics system of equations is solved with a fully-implicit formulation by use of an effective implementation of the Newton-Raphson method in the default mode. |The coupled simulator is by design maximally modular with self-contained flow and geomechanics modules that can be operated in a two-way coupled mode with explicit-, iterative-, and fully-implicit-coupling options. The coupled-modeling system lends itself naturally not only to near-wellbore coupled flow and geomechanical deformation problems where poroplasticity may play a more prominent role, but also to reservoir-scale simulations where both poroelasticity and poroplasticity are relevant. The coupled simulator is validated against analytical solutions for simple cases, by use of published data in the open literature.

Hamed, University of Calgary| Heidari Sureshjani, Mohammadhossein, IOR Research Institute","|Summary |Long-term transient linear flow of hydraulically fractured vertical and horizontal wells completed in tight/shale gas wells has historically been analyzed by use of the square-root-of-time plot. Pseudovariables are typically used for compressible fluids to account for pressure-dependence of fluid properties. Recently, a corrected pseudotime has been introduced for this purpose, in which the average pressure in the distance of investigation (DOI) is calculated with an appropriate material-balance equation. The DOI calculation is therefore a key component in the determination of the linear-flow parameter (product of fracture half-length and square root of permeability, xfvk) and the calculation of contacted fluid in place. Until now, the DOI for transient linear flow has been determined empirically, and may not be accurate for all combinations of fluid properties and operating conditions.  |In this work, we have derived the DOI equations analytically for transient linear flow under constant-flowing-pressure and -rate conditions. For the first time, rigorous methodologies have been used for this purpose. Two different approaches were used: the maximum rate of pressure response (impulse concept) and the transient/boundary-dominated flow intersection method. The two approaches resulted in constants in the DOI equation that are much different from previously derived versions for the constant-flowing-pressure case. The accuracy of the new equations was tested by analyzing synthetic production data from a series of fine-grid numerical simulations. Single-phase oil and gas cases were analyzed; pseudovariable alteration for pressure-dependent porosity and permeability was required in the analysis. |The calculated linear-flow parameters, determined from our new DOI formulations for the constant-flowing-bottomhole-pressure (FBHP) case, and the input values to numerical simulation, are in good agreement. Of the two new DOI-calculation methods provided, the maximum rate of pressure response (unit impulse method) provides more accurate results. Finally, a field case was analyzed to determine the impact of DOI formulations on derivations of the linear-flow parameter from field data. |Linear-flow analysis on the basis of the DOI calculations presented in this work is significantly improved over previous formulations for constant FBHP.|","rate-transient analysis, unconventional gas, distance of investigation, unconventional light oil"

However, it offers low recovery factors (~5-15%) and creates a complex network of high-permeability channels known as workholes, while simultaneously changing formation compressibility and in-situ stress conditions. Eventually, development of such a network would lead to a softer layer within the shallow unconsolidated reservoir, which can carry less of the overburden stress. Further development of such reservoirs is usually achieved through enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) applications in the form of cyclic solvent stimulation within an economic framework. Cyclic loading and unloading of this EOR technique make it even more difficult to predict the recovery performance. |In this study, a 3D geomechanical model was used to calculate the stress distribution in a history-matched field in Alberta with 15 producers. The fractal patterns generated from the diffusion-limited-aggregation (DLA) algorithm were used to represent the wormhole network with different strength properties. Foamy behaviour of heavy oil was modelled with the help of a set of kinetic reactions. The hydro-geomechanical model was then used for field-development planning, reservoir management, and assessment of near-wellbore regions during cyclic injection and production. The fieldwide deformation and stress changes were analyzed in deep overburden, caprock, and reservoir to show the influence of local stress orientations in soft and stiff layers. |Next, we considered a sector model with a single well. The model introduced was used to assess EOR processes with different solvent streams. While light hydrocarbon components help to repressurize the formation, the heavier components seem more effective in heavy-oil dilution. This occurred while stress arching redistributed the cyclic injection/production-induced stresses to flow around soft inclusions. Although it is difficult to obtain data to calibrate the 3D hydro-geomechanical model, it allows for reliable investigation of reservoir performance and provides deeper insight than does the use of flow simulation alone. The assessment of the potential of geomechanics can ascertain whether a more-detailed modelling is necessary.|","Geomechanics, Porosity/permeability change, CHOPS, Cyclic Solvent injection"

The model is based on the classical series and parallel modes, introducing a parameter of statistical force transfer paths among particles in HBS. Macro-triaxial compression tests and micro X-ray computed tomography (CT) observations of HBS in the gas-saturated formation mode were conducted. The applicability of the model was checked through the comparison between tests and theoretical results. |Introduction |Natural gas hydrate, a compound of methane molecules and water molecules, extensively exists in marine and permafrost sediments. Hydrate-bearing sediment (HBS) is a new kind of multiphase composite geotechnical material that consists of the gas hydrate, soil skeleton, and pore fluid of gas and water. The mechanical properties of HBS are the basic parameters for the analysis of soil deformation and failures during hydrate exploration and exploitation. |Many studies have been conducted in the laboratory by triaxial compression tests to obtain the mechanical data of HBS (Masui et al., 2008; Hyodo et al., 2007; Hyodo, 2013; Miyazaki et al., 2010; Miyazaki and Masui, 2011; Waite et al., 2008, 2009; Winters, 1999; Winters et al., 2004; Yun et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012a; Song et al., 2010). Different methodologies for sampling methane hydrate (dissolved gas method, partial water saturation method, ice-seeding method, hydrate premixing method) resulted in different hydrate occurrence modes in the pores of sediment (Ecker et al., 2000; Winters et al., 2004). By the most adopted dissolved gas method, heterogeneous nucleation occurs on the particle surface, subsequently grows into the pore space (pore-filling type), and goes to the final cementation with grains (grain-cementation type). The most pronounced increase in strength occurs when the hydrate saturation exceeds 40%. The explanation is that once hydrate saturation exceeds the critical value, the hydrate occurrence mode transfers from the pore-filling type to the grain-cementation type.|","hydrate saturation,  series and parallel model,  elastic modulus, Hydrate-bearing sediment,  hydrate occurrence"

The experiments were conducted in three scaled prismatic tanks at scales of 1=20, 1=40, and 1=60 with roll excitation, and the impact pressure was measured. The experimental results demonstrate that the kinematic free-surface behavior, time traces, and spatial distribution of the impact pressure during a single roll wave impact exhibit non-similarity in the three geometrically similar tanks. Furthermore, the quantitative statistical analysis of the impact pressure and impact rise time indicates that Froude’s law yields conservative estimates for the slamming force in the tank by using the same experimental media. |Introduction |The challenge of designing floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facilities has attracted considerable attention from both the offshore gas exploration industry and academia. Floating above the deep water or marginal gas fields, the FLNG system is designed to produce, liquefy, store, and transfer liquefied natural gas (LNG). Consequently, it needs large volume tanks, a large amount of deck space, and easy maintenance. Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) membrane-type cargo containment systems (CCSs) have an advantage over other types of CCSs for FLNG facilities. They afford the maximum utilization of the ship’s space, making use of the ship’s support structure. However, due to cost efficiency and low-temperature preservation considerations, one drawback to the GTT membrane CCS is the capability of the thin insulation layer to bear liquid impact. Furthermore, one significant difference between the LNG CCS and FLNG CCS is that the FLNG system has no restriction for filling conditions (American Bureau of Shipping, 2010). Liquid tends to slosh in a partially filled tank. These slosh-generated loads have a considerable influence on the tank and support structure design. The slamming force has long been of interest to designers and researchers because it has resulted in structural local damage and liquefied natural gas leakage during LNG shipping (Abramson et al., 1974; Gavory and De Seze, 2009). Thus, it is essential to determine the slamming force caused by violent liquid movements in partially filled tanks in the design of CCSs for FLNG facilities. |Both theoretical and numerical methods have limitations in predicting rapid overturning or the strongly nonlinear free surface with large amplitude slamming and complicated tank shapes, which is reported by many researchers (Abramson et al., 1974; Lee and Choi, 1999; Faltinsen and Timokha, 2009). The experimental approach is efficient and accurate in revealing the complicated physical phenomena during liquid sloshing. Monitoring the slamming force of CCS prototypes for in-service LNG carriers is expensive, difficult, and dangerous. Furthermore, it is difficult to eliminate uncertain factors that are not relevant to the slamming force in prototype experiments (Malenica et al., 2009). Hence, few prototype tests have been conducted, and there is little public information on such tests because of commercial conservation. The scaled model test is a practical approach for filling in the gaps between theoretical, numerical methods and prototype experiments. The slamming pressure obtained by the sloshing model test is processed to identify the most critical sloshing force on the containment system structure. Although many sloshing model studies have been conducted, the effect of scaling remains unclear (Faltinsen and Timokha, 2009).|","experiment,  geometrically similar tank,  slamming pressure, Non-similarity"

The tests were conducted under temperatures ranging from -20 ± 2°C to 20 ± 2°C. A cycle of testing consisted of 5 h of freezing followed by another 5 h of thawing under full saturation with water. In this paper, a total of 200 cycles of the freeze–thaw test were performed and were followed by measurements of porosity, absorption, ultrasonic velocity, and Shore hardness per each 20 cycles, with uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) determined every 50 cycles. The strength of the SW rocks decreased by approximately 0.07 MPa per single cycle, while that of MW rocks decreased by approximately 0.19 MPa per single cycle. During the 200 cycles of SW rocks, the absorption increased from 0.23% to 0.39% and the P-wave velocity decreased from 4,227 m/s to 3,596 m/s. Similarly, those of MW rocks changed from 0.65% to 1.6% and from 3,751 m/s to 2,877 m/s. In conclusion, it was inferred that the properties of SW rocks that experienced approximately 200–300 cycles of freeze–thaw became close to those of MW rocks. |Introduction |As freeze–thaw of rock is greatly dependent on surrounding weather, weather and rock characteristics need to be considered to identify the weathering mechanism of rock in freeze–thaw processes. Rock exposed to extremely cold environments, like the environment of Antarctica, remains frozen all year round, and thus it is necessary to test the rock while it is in a frozen state to identify its structural characteristics. Bortz et al. (1993) suggested correlations between rocks (limestone, granite, and marble) tested at the natural state and artificial weathering conditions. When it comes to marble, 12–16 cycles of the described treatment are considered to be equivalent to one year of natural weathering, and structural changes were determined after 300 cycles for granite, 500 cycles for marble, and 200 cycles for limestone. Measuring the properties of rock frozen at the climatic condition of the Antarctic showed that moisture evaporation occurred from saturated frozen rock. Nicholson and Nicholson (2000) showed the strength degradation that occurred through applying the freeze–thaw test to 10 kinds of sedimentary rock. The saturation state of the sample could not be identified because the sample was simply submerged without considering evaporation.|","Freeze-thaw,  gneiss,  engineering property,  Terra Nova Bay,  weathering"

One of these problems faced by drillers is lost circulation of drilling fluids, which can lead to greater issues such as differential sticking and well-control events. Field applications show that wellbore strengthening effectively helps reduce mud-loss volume by increasing the safe mud-weight window. Wellbore-strengthening applications are usually designed on the basis of induced-fracture characteristics (i.e., fracture length, fracture width, and stress-intensity factor). In general, these fracture characteristics depend on several parameters, including in-situ stress magnitude, in-situ stress anisotropy, mechanical properties, rock texture, wellbore geometry, mud weight, wellbore trajectory, pore pressure, natural fractures, and formation anisotropy. Analytical models available in literature oversimplify the fracture-initiation and fracture-propagation process with assumptions such as isotropic stress field, no near-wellbore stress-perturbation effects, vertical or horizontal wells only (no deviation/inclinations), constant fracture length, and constant pressure within the fracture. For more-accurate predictions, different numerical methods, such as finite element and boundary element, have been used to determine fracture-width distribution. However, these calculations can be computationally costly or difficult to implement in near-real time. The aim of this study is to provide a fast-running, semianalytical work flow to accurately predict fracture-width distribution and fracture-reinitiation pressure (FRIP). The algorithm and work flow can account for near-wellbore-stress perturbations, far-field stress anisotropy, and wellbore inclination/deviation. The semianalytical algorithm is modeled after singular integral formulations of stress field and solved by use of Gauss-Cheyshev polynomials. The proposed model is computationally efficient and accurate. The model also provides a comprehensive perspective on formation-strengthening scenarios; a tool for improved lost-circulation-materials design; and an explanation of how they are applicable during drilling operation (in particular, through depleted zones). Sensitivity analysis included in this paper quantifies the effect of different rock properties, in-situ-stress field/anisotropy, and wellbore geometry/deviation on the fracture-width distribution and FRIP. In addition, the case study presented in this paper demonstrates the applicability of the proposed work flow in the field.|","wellbore strengthening, fracture width distribution, casing while drilling, particle size distribution, lost circulation material"

However, rocks are well-known to exhibit static fatigue; that is, delayed failure at stresses less than the tensile strength. In this paper, we explore the consequences of delayed failure on axially oriented initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures. Specifically, given a certain breakdown pressure, we investigate the conditions under which subsequent hydraulic fracture(s) can begin within the time frame of a stimulation treatment in regions of higher stress and/or strength because of delayed-failure mechanisms. The results show that wells completed in shallower formations are more sensitive to variations in strength, whereas wells completed in deeper formations are more sensitive to variations in stress. Furthermore, cases in which all hydraulic fractures break down according to the same pressurization regime--that is, all are ""fast"" (nonfluid-penetrating) pressurization or else all are ""slow"" (uniformly pressurized fluid-penetrating) pressurization cases--are highly sensitive to small stress/strength variability. On the other hand, if the first hydraulic-fracture initiation is in the ""fast""-pressurization regime and subsequent fracture(s) are in the ""slow""-pressurization regime, then the system is robust to a much-higher degree of variability in stress/strength. Practically, this work implies that methods aimed at moderately reducing the variability in stress/strength among the possible initiation points (i.e., perforation clusters) within a particular stage can have a strong effect on whether multiple hydraulic fractures will begin. In addition, this analysis implies that pumping strategies that encourage ""fast,"" nonpenetrative breakdown of the first initiation point followed by the opportunity for fluid-penetrating, ""slow"" breakdown of subsequent initiation points could be effective at encouraging multiple-hydraulic-fracture initiation.|","fracture modeling, hydraulic fracturing, fracture initiation, multiple fracture growth, horiztonal well completions"

Phenomena such as shear-band development and shear-enhanced permeability are of paramount importance during hydraulic fracturing of cohesionless sand or weak sandstones, which make the fracturing response quite different from what it is conventionally believed to be in competent rocks. |The smeared approach in simulating hydraulic fracturing has been implemented in the proposed model within the continuum mechanics framework. Both matrix and fracture flow have been considered in this model. Tensile- and shear-fracture development and their fluid flow were simulated. The cubic law and Touhidi-Baghini’s shear-permeability model (Touhidi-Baghini 1998) were used to capture the permeability evolution and to model flow in tensile and shear fractures, respectively. Shear fracturing of geomaterials involves intense localization of deformation and strain softening, which is a discontinuous phenomenon, resulting in mesh dependency of the results in the continuum model. The fracture-energy-regularization method was used in this model to reduce the mesh-size dependency of the energy dissipated during fracture propagation. |The smeared-fracture approach has been validated against laboratory hydraulic-fracturing experiments with reasonable agreement. Consistent with the experiments, the results of the numerical model indicate that tensile fractures are formed in a very small area around the injection point despite the application of high injection pressure compared with the minimum boundary stress. It is found that shear fracturing and shear-permeability evolution are the most important mechanisms that influence and control the fracturing response.

An operator is delivering complex extended-reach drilling (ERD) wells from an offshore platform and experiencing up to three weeks of nonproductive time (NPT) to pull out of hole (POOH) bottomhole assembly (BHA). Multiple BHA’s have been lost in the 17 <U+00BD>-in. hole section in faults, and packing-off in unstable formations. Initially the root cause was identified to be hole cleaning, in particular, in the ""heel"" of the section-avalanche zone-extending 400m below the 18 5/8-in. casing shoe. Cleaning an ERD high angle (>70°), large hole well is a well-known challenge. The initial solution was to reduce the hole size from 17 <U+00BD>-in. to 16-in. while running the same casing string. This was done primarily to increase the annular velocity to improve hole cleaning. As we will see, as the Operator continued to analyze the problems, the root cause changed, as did the solutions, but 16-in. hole size was still the preferred hole size for the many benefits it brings. All risks associated with the change in hole size had to be understood and managed. 
Solutions that were executed, included: trajectory optimization based on updated Geomechanics modelling, Extended Leak-off-tests, flat rheology drilling fluid, mud additives, cementing recipes, ""fit for purpose"" BHA design, Drilling/POOH/Casing running pre-job modeling and real time monitoring. All this helped to optimize the delivery of a ""cemented-in-place 13 3/8-in."" production casing for the most recent well in the Lunskoye gas field. 
The optimized high angle 16-in. hole section was drilled from 1264m to 3806m Measured Depth (MD) (2542m length) at over 80° inclination. The 13 3/8-in. production casing was then run and cemented without any issues to the planned depth in this reduced hole size. Previously, the same size production casing was run on the project in 17 <U+00BD>-in. sections. On this particular well the hole section was delivered 29 days ahead of the planned approved for expenditure (AFE) time of 55 days. Additional benefits gained by drilling a smaller hole size were savings of 67 m3 of cement and 110 m3 of drilling fluid. Two logistic boat trips were also saved due to fewer materials required. The method also increases the cuttings re-injection (CRI) capability and longevity, bringing additional long-term savings. 
The successful drilling of this well shows the benefits and qualitative acceptance of downsizing the hole for this major Sakhalin offshore project. The well also provides a basis for the oil and gas industry population to consider the possibility and benefits of drilling a 16-in. extended reach hole size instead of a 17 <U+00BD>-in. hole and cementing in place the 13 3/8-in. casing string.|","ERD solutions for 16-in drilling, Drilling 16-in instead 17.5, Extended Reach Drilling, Drilling 16-in ERD hole section, Downsizing 17.5 to 16-in ERD hole section"

Since 2012, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has attempted several hydraulic fracture monitoring (HFM) evaluations in deep, high-temperature, tight gas wells in the Amin Formation of the Fahud salt basin. The first successful job was executed in late 2014 for treatments placed in a horizontal wellbore. Following this job, in-depth HFM analyses were conducted that led to recommendations on well completion and fracturing treatment improvements. The purpose of the HFM trial in this challenging tight gas Amin reservoir of the Fahud salt basin was evaluating hydraulic fracture geometries, fracture propagation, and orientation. The horizontal well had been purposely drilled in the vicinity of an earlier completed vertical well to enable execution of the HFM job. Microseismic monitoring provided a direct measurement of the rock-failure coordinates and helped in gauging the effectiveness of the hydraulic fracture treatment placed in two clusters of the same fracturing stage. A large set of raw data representing 52,000 triggers was recorded and processed through different filtering methods including processing noise generated from gas flow in the monitoring well behind the casing. The evaluation suggested that the fractures have grown upward. It also revealed fracture length dimensions and stimulated reservoir volume along with the previously unmeasured fracture azimuthal orientation. The HFM job provided insight on how the hydraulic fractures propagate when two perforation clusters are placed in different stress zones, and if it is possible to place comparable hydraulic fractures in both. HFM results were coupled with geomechanics work and post-fracturing production logging to develop recommendations for future well completion improvements.|","HFM, tight, exploration, gas, microseismic"

The Raageshwari Deep Gas Field, Barmer Basin, India is a low permeability, moderate CGR gas condensate reservoir. It is a low net to gross system with gross reservoir thickness varying from 500-1000m. The pay zone consists of a poorly sorted sandstone interval on top of a stacked volcanic succession of thick lava flow cycles. The wells have been completed with multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulations to allow production at economical rates. 
The major challenge is to improve fracture placement to achieve wellbore connection with the entire net reservoir storage and flow capacity. Connecting each and every net reservoir packet would increase the number of fracture stages and in turn increase the cost significantly. Thus an optimization workflow was generated to increase the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing and reduce the cost of connecting the maximum net reservoir through hydraulic fractures. 
An integrated approach including petrophysical and geomechanical analyses was used to identify the potential zones for hydraulic fracturing. Fracturing technologies like limited entry technique using cluster perforation were used to increase the net connected reservoir thickness while employing as few fracture stages as possible. Several post fracturing data acquisition programmes were conducted to estimate fracture parameters such as fracture height, half-length and conductivity to help evaluate the performance of each fracture stage. Single well analytical and numerical models were developed to estimate the impact of connecting maximum net reservoir thickness in terms of both initial production rate (IP) and the expected ultimate recovery (EUR) of the reservoir. 
The limited entry fracturing technique with cluster perforation used in several wells was helpful in connecting the maximum net reservoir in the thick gross pay sections present. Based on a cost-benefit analysis, the number of fracture stages for each well was optimized with the goal of connecting the maximum net reservoir thickness to the wellbore. The fracture height achieved in each fracture stage was verified through micro-seismic, RST and temperature log measurements and pressure transient analyses. Once the height was ascertained, other parameters were obtained from post-fracturing pressure matches and pressure build up data. The estimated impact of connecting the maximum net reservoir storage and flow capacity as compared with the initial plan of 4-5 conventional single perforation hydraulic fractures is estimated to be production of ~5% GIIP in 15 years.|","Fracturing, Tight Gas, Hydraulic Fracturing, Low Permeability, Cluster Perforation"

The study area is part of a producing field where the reservoir pressure has been depleted to 3450 psi from virgin reservoir pressure of 5235psi at top of gas reservoir due to production. This paper represents how the integrated reservoir geomechanics was used for efficient well planning and safe drilling of two very first nearly horizontal wells (78°- 82° Inclination) through this depleted sandstone gas reservoir of Cretaceous age in offshore deep water (1175m TVDSS) Krishna-Godavari basin, East Coast of India. 
Stress changes due to pressure depletion in reservoir causes horizontal stresses to decrease, whereas shear failure gradient (minimum mud weight requirement to prevent borehole collapse or breakouts) may still remain higher depending on stress magnitudes, strength of sandstone reservoir, intra-reservoir shale and wellbore trajectory. Thus, drilling a very high angle well through depleted reservoir in an offshore deepwater condition generates big challenges compare to drilling in pre-production stage of field. An integrated reservoir geomechanics methodology were used to minimized the uncertainties of different geomechanical parameters in order to accurate estimation of shear failure gradient and horizontal stress reductions. The Geomechanical model built by integrating rock mechanical (Lab test data), geological (3-D Reservoir model), petrophysical (raw logs, processed logs), reservoir (pressure behaviour), drilling data and production data has lowered the uncertainty in model and reduced risks associated for drilling. 
This integrated reservoir geomechanics approach results in optimum drilling plan mud weight window in the depleted (depleted by ~ 1800psi) reservoir section for the planned well (78° Inclination) and well was drilled successfully without any drilling complications/events. After verifying the applicability of the Mechanical Earth Model, another near-horizontal well (82° Inclination) through depleted reservoir of this field was drilled successfully. Methodology adopted in this paper also highlights how a reliable geomechanical model can be built for a field which having geomechanical parameters related data constraint. Approach adopted in this paper can be used for well planning and drilling of future virgin as well as depleted vertical or deviated wells in East Coast of India. 
Paper illustrates the advantages of using 3-D Reservoir model based seismic attributes (P-Impedance) derived porosity and facies data for more reliable estimation of rock strength in the reservoir rocks encountered along the well path rather than directly using offset well porosity data. MCC (Mechanical Consolidation Curve) for clean sandstone (Porosity > 0.2) has been generated for East Coast of India to reduce uncertainty on rock strength estimation. This MCC will be an effective alternative tool to predict reliable rock strength values in any reservoir section of Krishna-Godavari basin.|","Risk Reductions and Safe Drilling, Reservoir Geomechanics, Depleted Reservoir, Offshore Krishna-Godavari Basin, Near Horizontal Wells"

The Keshen reservoir is a naturally fractured, deep, tight gas sandstone reservoir under high-tectonic stress. Stimulation is critical to the successful development of the Keshen gas field. However, due to the heterogeneity of the natural fracture system in the reservoir, there is large variation in natural productivity from production wells, which mandates different types of stimulation operations from simple acidizing to massive hydraulic fracturing. Hence, to improve the efficiency of reservoir stimulation and overall performance of the reservoir development, reliably evaluating the natural productivity from production wells and optimizing well stimulation strategy (by selecting appropriate stimulation operations) are required. 
To this end, single well production history matches were conducted to calculate the natural fracture (NF) permeabilities for 12 acidizing wells with known matrix petrophysical properties. It was found out that the NF permeability is clearly correlated to the intersection angle ((, angle between maximum horizontal stress and NF strike) and Young's modulus (E), based on detailed natural fracture interpretation and geomechanics analysis. By using a correlation with the intersection angle and Young's modulus, the NF permeabilities for seven hydraulic fractured wells with large size treatment were obtained and the natural productivity for each well was predicted. By comparing predicted natural productivity with actual post-stimulation productivity, the productivity enhancement by hydraulic fracturing treatment was determined. The comparison showed that the productivity improvements by hydraulic fracturing treatment were very limited and unnecessary for the wells with high natural productivity, while improvements were substantial for others. Subsequently, the well stimulation selection criterion was formulated, which classified wells into three categories based on the natural productivity, and specified stimulation method was recommended for each well category, respectively. 
This paper shows an example: the natural productivity of a newly drilled well was predicted, and massive hydraulic fracturing was selected based on the stimulation treatment selected criterion. The well was successfully stimulated with absolute open flow (AOF) of 3.6 MMm3/d, which doubled the natural productivity. 
The workflow used to estimate the natural productivity of the tectonically active Keshen reservoir and to establish the well stimulation selection criterion, and their application and validation, which are rarely published previously, are presented in this paper.|","Natural productivity, Stimulation candidate selection, Stimulation optimization, Fracture characterization, Natural fracture"

At present, thermal recovery is an important method for developing heavy oil reservoirs effectively. However, the leakage of cement slurry into the formation during cementing and steam leakage through cement in the annular space around a cemented casing during production have become a problem to be urgently solved in heavy oil reservoir thermal recovery production. 
The solutions to these problems are usage of two-stage cement slurry system and the dynamic vibration cementing. The well section from 100 metres above the top of oil layer to the wellhead is cemented by a novel foam cement slurry system, and the rest of the barefoot interval is cementedby the good thermal-stability cement slurry system by using the dynamic vibration cementing technique. The objective of usage of two-stagecement slurry system is to reduceannulus fluid column pressure, and the objective of the dynamic vibration cementing is to achieve a stable hydraulic seal. 
The consequences of the pressure reduction in the cement columnare evident. Not only the difficulty of leakage in cementing is settled by applying the low-density foam cement slurry, of which the density is 1.40 g/cm3, but also the heat loss of wellbore is decreased because of reduction of thermal conductivity. The performance of thermal-stability hardened cement paste before and aftersteam vapor curing was compared by lab experiments. The result shows that the compression strength, tensile strength and shear stress of hardened cement paste and of hardened cement pastehad little change. SEM photographs indicate that the microstructure of hardening cement after vibration action is more compact. 
These results had been validated on site test. Through the comparison and analysis of cementing quality of two wells in the same block, it has proved that the well with this novel cementing technique is better quality than the other one. The CBL/VDL test report revealed that acoustic amplitude value of the well is less than 10%. The formation wave of the well is clearer than the other and casing wave is weaker. 
Through usage of two-stagecement slurry system, not only the difficulty of leak formation in cementing is settled, but also the wellbore heat loss have come down significantly during the course of thermodynamic oil exploitation. And the dynamic vibration cementing can achieve a good thermal-stability hydraulic seal in the annulus space.|","foam cement slurry, heavy oil reservoirs, dynamic vibration cementing, two-stage cement slurry system"

Oil sand characterization tests are essential for the selection and evaluation of sand control devices. Current approaches for screen selection and evaluation usually rely on Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and neglect the effect of important parameters such as porosity, grain shape and frictional properties. One aim of this study is to characterize oil sand's mechanical, geometrical and size characteristics that should be considered in the completion design. Another objective is to determine if natural mixture of oil sand could be reasonably replicated with commercial sands for large-scale sand control evaluation tests. 
In this paper we present the results of a comprehensive image analysis and laser sieve analysis on oil sand samples from the McMurray Formation to quantify geometrical grain characteristics (sphericity, aspect ratio, convexity and angularity) of the sand grains and establish the PSD of the samples. Direct shear tests were performed to assess the frictional characteristics of different oil sands around the liner under variable stress conditions during the SAGD well lifecycle. 
Image analysis, PSD, and direct shear tests showed that natural mixture of oil sand could be successfully simulated with commercial sands in terms of size and shape of grains and mechanical properties. This conclusion is significant to those performing large-scale sand control evaluation tests that usually require large quantities of sands that are not readily available and require significant preparation. 
This paper provides the first comprehensive investigation of the granular, and geomechanical characteristics of oil sand from the McMurray Formation. The paper discusses the missing parameters in the design of sand control device, and evaluates test methods that measure those parameters. The proposed testing program could be used as a benchmark for oil sand characterization in relation to the design and evaluation of sand control device.|","Grain shape, fine contents, Particle size distribution, Porosity, Standalone screen"

The work is important because of the presence of stress-dependent slot and/or microfracture porosities and permeabilities in tight formations that can affect significantly reservoir performance and forecasting. |Recent work has shown that drill cuttings can be used quantitatively for complete petrophysical evaluation (for example determination of porosity, water saturation, pore throat aperture, Young Modulus, Poisson's ratio and brittleness index (Olusola and Aguilera, 2013; Ortega and Aguilera, 2014).

F., Texas A&M University| Flores, D., Petroamazonas EP| Sierra, F., Petroamazonas EP","|Seismic inversion approach has been applied with a moderate success in some siliciclastic reservoirs in Oriente Basin characterized by their prominent lateral facies variations. Different types of facies with different geological and petrophysical characteristics can produce similar response in seismic velocities. Based on this fact, inversion results such as acoustic impedance, S-Impedance, Vp/Vs., Poisson ratio and other derived elastic parameters can be misinterpreted leading to locating faked prolific zones in areas where facies do not have enough quality to be considered productive. In order to avoid this problem, rock physics analysis is used to tie the seismic inversion results to the geological and petrophysical rock characteristics. The Sun model has been proven to characterize successfully the seismic response of carbonate and siliciclastics rocks and infer geological, depositional, diagenetical and petro physical characteristics from sonic logs and seismic data. Using the compressional frame flexibility factor (?k) and the shear frame flexibility factor (?u) derived from this model, it is possible to successfully correlate geological, depositional and diagenetical characteristics to the seismic response using well log and core data from a siliciclastic reservoir in Oriente Basin. ?k and ?s factors characterize the influence of pore structure on the variability of compressibility and shear sonic velocities respectively in rocks. For the studied siliciclastic reservoir, which presents a prominent lateral variation in facies related to its depositional process, different ranges of ?k factor values represent different kind of facies. Values of ?k between 2 and 6 in ""U"" sandstone reservoir are closely correlated to the best quality facies. According to the integrated rock physical, petrophysical and geological analysis in well locations, clean massive sandstones with fine to medium grain size and moderately sorting are represented by this ?k value interval. Using simultaneous inversion results, volumes of porosity and ?k are inverted from seismic data. Spatial distribution of the ?k values in the inverted volume correlates very well with a previous sedimentological and stratigraphic interpretation study using core data descriptions. Finally, using porosity and values of ?k, the discrimination of the best quality facies is performed.

By the interpretation of any each build-up and/or fall-off from PDG readings it is possible to improve the near wellbore characterization, mainly because PDG signatures usually are not significantly affected by wellbore storage. This last advantage has motivated this work to review and further evaluates flow regimes in the wellbore surroundings that wasn't possible to be characterized due to wellbore storage effects. From this assumption, this paper presents a new study of transient pressure behavior in deviated wells. The investigation was based on an analytical solution derived for an infinite radial extent reservoir limited with both bottom-up impermeable reservoir boundary layers and uniform flow condition at the wellbore. From that, type curves were generated for different slant angles of the well and dimensionless formation thickness. The analysis showed a new flow regime called Transition Radial Flow (TRF), in a zone where, before PDG, was mainly dominated by wellbore storage. The TRF develops between early time and late time infinite acting radial flow (IARF), where the reservoir permeability can be estimated before the IARF development. Together, an alternative procedure was developed for interpreting transient pressure data using this new flow regime.

The oilfield development and reservoir exploitation strategy for this kind of reservoirs must take into account the impact of geomechanical issues on modelling any reservoir production scenario, either for a single well or sector model simulator. The modelling or simulation tools used to represent the performance and behavior of heavy oil reservoirs present some limitations such as they are not fully coupled and they only use a nonlinear elastic constitutive model to represent the mechanical behavior of the reservoir. Both examples show major limitations to figure out a closer analysis to the true behavior of heavy oil reservoirs. The geological formations related with mentioned reservoirs usually present a mechanical behavior similar to materials with very low capacity to support changes in the stress-state and to present permanent and unrecoverable deformations after loading and unloading processes. Therefore, to analyze the behavior of heavy oil reservoir is mandatory to use modelling tools that incorporate a coupled analysis between fluid-flow process and strain-stress using an elasto-plastic constitutive model. |The elasto-plastic constitutive model defines the plastic and elastic phenomenon caused by loading and unloading that occurs in the heavy oil-reservoir. Several research centers have been focused to design experimental tests to learn more thoroughly the results provided by this model, and the results have been satisfactory. However, laboratory tests are not easy to access in most of cases, so it is necessary to have a numerical simulation model that allows knowing the mechanical behavior of the reservoir associated for any production scenario or strategy. |This paper presents the results from a coupled model, which integrates both the geomechanics and fluid-flow equations for a single-well case using different constitutive models.

The results comparison for the three considered cases, just fluid flow, an elastic lineal behavior of the rock and finally an elasto-plastic behavior, provides a great difference between the stress-state among cases with a dramatic change in the formation permeability, and therefore in the reservoir pressure. |This numerical model is a useful approximation to improve the characterization of heavy oil reservoirs.

After five months of production (from 30-Aug-2014 to 4-Jan-2015), the well had accumulated 9 bbls of sand (equivalent weight: 3650 kg), lower than expected (not showing on surface) and average production was 1126 bbls of fluid per day (1075 bbls of Oil per day, 4.53% water cut), significantly higher than neighbor wells. |This methodology accurately predicted the critical drawdown at which a well with potential sanding problems must be produced.

The CT number, which is a function of the density and composition of the rock was observed to correlate with both porosity and permeability values that were measured discretely along the core using conventional laboratory techniques. A mathematical expression was fit to the data that allows the prediction of the porosity and the permeability of the core within the 350 µm isotropic resolution that the CT scanning unit is capable of. |We also show that in the case of reservoirs with high vertical heterogeneity, where permeability variations of hundreds of millidarcies occur within one foot, the selection by visual inspection of core plugs for laboratory measurement of petrophysical properties leads to a flawed characterization of the stratigraphic column as some of the plugs are taken along bedding planes, and therefore are comprised of more than one rock type.

This paper presents how electrical log-core data integration obtained a correlation between lithology, lithological accessories, sedimentary structures, structural features, fossils, ichnofossils and fluid impregnation, among others, from the interpretation of two hundred and twenty nine feet of a sedimentary sequence within core data and a high-resolution acoustic-resistivity image log from well DN-22 in Drago field.

Likewise, based on patterns and characteristic responses seen in resistivity and acoustic image log (coloring and shading contrast, texture, clasts, clay laminations, fossils traces, fossils), electrofacies were identified and framed into the same facies catalog. The resulting analysis established eight sedimentary-electrofacies, this contributes to further extrapolate detail sedimentological analysis for coming wells in this field by using high-resolution image logs.

Based on the information from the Blanca-1well, and other nearby wells, the stratigraphic features of the Tena Sandstone have been defined. Using 3D seismic data and petrophysical information obtained from wells drilled in the area, the structural and the static models have been elaborated. Considering the production history and the behavior of fluid pressure, material balance was applied in order to estimate the original oil in place.

A significant challenge for the hydrocarbon industry at the beginning of the current century was related to geologically high-risk oil and gas reservoirs. This led a new generation of geoscientists to focus on three important areas: mature fields, deep water, and unconventional reservoirs. Fortunately, several technological drilling and software innovations have helped further the understanding of global petroleum systems. This paper discusses a case history in which geological integration was performed by a diverse group of geoscientists of varying disciplines, whereby the introduction of integrated geological techniques using computer systems allowed a better conceptualization of reservoir behavior, helping to reduce analysis time. The integrated method uses TIER quantification, which allows enhanced visualization for specialists to identify potential hydrocarbon zones and volumes in the reservoir. This involves generating a two-dimensional (2D) sweet-spot map that is overlaid on petrophysical maps to show the distribution of principal reservoir properties (e.g., effective porosity, hydrocarbon content, pore volume, permeability, sand volume, etc.). Petrophysical evaluation curves are used to calculate a three-dimensional (3D) sweet-spot log using a computer program, which facilitates modeling of the heterogeneity and depth range of the reservoir. It is possible to populate the 3D sweet-spot distribution into a geocellular model. The integration of the sweet-spot distribution, seismic attributes, historical oil production, and petroleum system studies allows for better determination of possible hydrocarbon reservoirs. This helps reduce uncertainty related to potential geological exploration opportunities. The original oil-in-place (OOIP) can be calculated using 3D geocells conforming to arrangements of simulation layers. The static geocellular model then undergoes scaling, which is transferred to a numerical simulator. 
This methodology has been applied in the tight-oil sand reservoir of the Chicontepec channel in Mexico, which is composed of a high stratigraphic element having a concentrated trend of productive Upper Paleocene sands. The structural fault model was not severely affected in the area of interest; therefore, it can be used as a reliable geological model to simplify the integration of sweet-spot distribution for prospective sand intervals.|","Spot, volume, Petrophysical, Geocellular, Map"

The result is used to correlate with several failure scenarios including confirmation of hydraulically fractured zones and to optimize net stress conditions for drilling and wellbore stability. |Geomechanical rock properties (Poisson's ratio, Young's Modulus, Biot vertical constant, rock strength, and the coefficient of angel friction) and the minimum horizontal stress (Shmin) are calculated from well logs. The Mohr failure criteria is considered in other to determine possible failure magnitude of normal stress. Based on the minimum horizontal stress, the magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress (Shmax) is delimited. This permits estimating failure magnitudes of normal, reverse, strike-slip faulting planes, wellbore and tensile breakout scenarios. |Based on the theory of wellbore equilibrium, the Shmax is calculated in the fractured interval. This is corroborated with different failure scenarios predicted with the Mohr-Coulomb envelopes, and the unconfined rock strength (UCS) estimated from well logs. |The stress polygon that describes the in situ stress magnitudes limitations before failure for the Willesden Green Field is elaborated, and defines a very low-stress zone in the highly gas saturated and permeable interval. The polygon is suitable for drilling design and geomechanical analysis, particularly in those intervals where wellbore stability may be a problem. |The methodology can have practical and wide application in several fields where the predictions are limited due to restricted geomechanical information.

Incorporating with frictional and acceleration pressure drops, a mathematical model with finite horizontal well conductivity (HWC) was established.

One of the main parameters used to estimate the stock tank oil initially in place is the water saturation, which depends mainly on the true resistivity (Rt) of the formation.

Roller-cone bits with tungsten carbide inserts (TCIs) have been the most reliable option to drill within challenging levels that are known to chip and break cutting mechanisms; however, dedicated runs through conglomerates caused additional trips to replace bits before reaching total depth of the section. To drill the entire section, PDC bits were requested with improved cutter technology and enhanced procedures to reduce damage on cutting structures. There were events, however, of destroyed bits within conglomerates without finishing all conglomerate levels, requiring another bit to drill the entire chert level, and low ROP to mitigate cutter breakage and chipping. The operator sought a new type PDC bit that could ensure drilling the entire conglomerate intervals with enhanced ROP and longer footage for the section after the chert-composed beds. |To develop a bit solution, engineers used finite element analysis–based modeling to implement a new-type hybrid bit by strategically positioning multiple conical diamond elements (CDEs) across the cutting structure from bit center to gauge. The CDE's unique geometry applies a concentrated point load to fracture high-compressive-strength formations more efficiently than flat cutters. The combination cutting structure (CDE/flat PDC) creates a high-efficiency plowing and shearing action that improves durability yet keeps the bit aggressive enough to obtain the required ROP in lithologies found after conglomerates. |The 12<U+00BC>-in hybrid CDE bit was tested in three separate wells in the Shushufindi and Aguarico fields, increasing ROP in the difficult lower chert conglomerate section compared with six direct offsets drilled with 519/616-(5 bladed PDC bits with 19-mm cutters and 6 bladed bits with 16-mm cutters) standard type PDC bits and where only one bit was used to drill entire interval considering different well profiles and used drives.

Petroamazonas EP is the national oil company in Ecuador. It holds most of the oil concessions Onshore and Offshore in the country. The oil and gas production targets require implementing advanced analysis that provides effective results on production.

This paper presents a new Material Balance Equation (MBE) for estimation of Original Gas in Place (OGIP) and Original Condensate in Place (OCIP) in shale gas condensate reservoirs. This material balance methodology allows estimating the critical time for implementing gas injection in those cases where condensate buildup represents a problem. Additionally, the proposed MBE considers the effects of free, adsorbed and dissolved gas condensate production, and also takes into-account the stress-dependency of porosity and permeability. An extension of the methodology is implemented for estimating the optimum time for hydraulically re-fracturing shale condensate reservoirs. |The new MBE applies to shale gas condensate reservoirs by incorporating a two-phase gas deviation factor (Z2) and total cumulative gas production (Gpt) that includes both gas and condensate. If a crossplot of P/Z2 (pressure/Z2) vs. Gpt is prepared for a conventional gas condensate reservoir, a single straight line is obtained. However, when the single-phase gas compressibility factor (Z) is used, a deviation from the linear behavior is observed once the reservoir pressure falls below the gas dew-point. This methodology is applied in this study to unconventional shale gas condensate. Since there are three characteristic stages of production in a shale gas reservoir (production of free, adsorbed and dissolved gas), the location of the aforementioned deviation will provide a hint of the production stage that will be affected by condensate buildup. For example, if the deviation point is located in the region where production of free gas is predominant, then the production due to desorption mechanisms will be negatively impacted because condensation will have already occurred in the reservoir, resulting on reduction of effective permeability to gas. This methodology allows then estimating the critical time for implementing gas injection on the basis of the total cumulative gas production. |Results are presented as crossplots of 1) P/Z2 vs. Gpt, 2) Gpt vs. time and 3) gas rate vs. time. It is concluded that estimation of the critical time for implementing gas injection is useful for improving the performance of those shale gas condensate reservoirs where condensate buildup represents a threat that can negatively impact the gas production rate. |The novelty of this work resides on the fact that the combined effect of free, adsorbed and dissolved gas production mechanisms on stress-sensitive shale gas condensate reservoirs has not been considered previously in the literature for estimation of OGIP and OCIP using an analytical MBE.|","Free, Adsorbed and Dissolved Gas, Original Gas in Place, Shale Gas Condensate Reservoirs, Material Balance Equation, Original Condensate in Place"

This research has been carried out in an area of 678 km2 to the southwest of Maracaibo Lake Basin, where the lower La Grita Member of Early Cretaceous Capacho Formation has an average depth of 7600 ft (2.31 km). La Grita Member consists mainly of calcareous dark grey and laminated shale with oil traces, deposited at about 80 ft (24.38 m) which span from uppermost Albian to Cenomanian. This member represents a transgressive cycle associated with the low section of La Luna Formation (main oil and gas source of the western Venezuela). Besides, this research area has some relative flat in the Cretaceous section with little tectonic affectations, which allow developing unconventional reservoirs. 
The methodology proposed by Kuuskraa et al. (2013) to assessment an unconventional reservoir play was used in multidisciplinary studies. A total of 35 wells, one well core, several 2D seismic data, electric logs and geochemical analysis were considered to carry out this study. To make petrophysical analysis the methodology of Passey et al. (1990) was used. 
The geochemical data in core samples indicated that this interval shows good conditions for oil generation, where the organic matter percent is between 4.5 – 7.5% of TOC, with a maturity profile in oil window (0.5 – 0.9% Ro). The sedimentation environment suggests that the organic matter is marine. Lithologic description of drill core exhibits calcareous shales with muddy appearance. The Member is composed mineralogically by quartz/feldspar (32), calcite (50%), clay (15%) and other minerals (3%). The brittleness index of the member is around 77%. The electric logs in Member exhibit high radioactivity in some zones possibly associated to abundance of organic content. The petrophysical model matches with core samples results, where the intervals observed with high radioactivity were associated with organic richness. The geomechanical characterization in the area reveals that the state of stress in situ was estimated as normal to transcurrent. Mechanical properties of unit show moderate values of Poisson's ratio (0.23 – 0.26), high values of Young's modulus (0.88 – 4.46 * 106 psi) and UCS (6000 – 13500 psi). The Member can be classified as brittle, according to methodology of Grieser and Bray (2007). Finally, the geochemical and geological features of the member allow suggesting a possible oil play in this area. Moreover, the brittleness index and mineralogical analysis show excellent properties to horizontal hydraulic fracking of rocks. 
La Grita Member has never been considered as rock generater of oil in the area. However, the member has reservoirs associated where wells produce oil through natural fractures of the unit. In these reservoirs oil production decrease quickly, affected by low permeability of rocks.|","Brittle, La Grita Member, Organic richness, Unconventional reservoir play, Calcareous shale"

This allows introducing for the first time in the SBRC the intermediate principal stress. In order to do it, in-situ stress variations as a function of depth are used to match failure stresses for five groups of rock failure experiments that have different values of least principal stress. Next the relationship is integrated with the diffusivity equation for estimating large-scale permeability. |German Continental Deep Drilling Project (KTB) data are used to test the validity of the new SBRC model. Two ‘hydraulic fracturing’ depths (9100 and 6360m) in the KTB site are used to demonstrate the methodology. Minimum permeabilities are calculated with the new SBRC to be 2.9<U+00D7>10-20 m2 at 6360 m and 3.1<U+00D7>10-20 m2 at 9100 m. Maximum permeabilities are 2.3<U+00D7>10-16 m2 at 6360 m and 2.9<U+00D7>10-16 m2 at 9100m. Thus the maximum permeability is approximately 4 orders of magnitude larger compared with the minimum permeability (1 m2 = 1.013E15 md). |Novelties of the approach can be summarized as follows: (1) the use of Mogi's (1969) empirical rock failure relationship for integrating intermediate principal stress into the SBRC geomechanical model (this cannot be done when using for example the Mohr-Coulomb rock failure criterion), (2) using a nonlinear relationship between the maximum and minimum principal stress and (3) calculating large-scale permeability.|","Mogi, Microseismic, SBRC, Geomechanics, Rock failure"

This paper discusses a different approach to defining rock types and lithofacies performed for the Hollin formation located in the Palo Azul field of Ecuador. The study includes a spectrum of depositional environments, which significantly influences geometry, diagenesis, and quality of the Hollin reservoir. This work integrates lithofacies and petrophysical properties using well log data, core, and sedimentological analyses to define rock types. 
Sedimentological analyses were performed to describe existing cores, thin sections, and X-ray diffraction results. Flow units were identified using flow zone indicator (FZI) and reservoir quality index (RQI) methods. These units were classified as functions of flow capacity (K/Phi) based on capillary pressure (Pc) and other special lab analyses. Capillary pressure enabled the grouping of rock flow units in accordance with the K/Phi ratio, similar RQI, and irreducible water saturation (Swirr) values. These rock types (RT) were correlated with the lithofacies identified using sedimentological analysis. 
The transgressive Hollin formation sequence includes fluvial mid-grained sandstones with cross stratification, tidal mid- to fine-grained sandstones with mud drapes and organic matter, and marine glauconitic sandstones with/without calcareous cement. Integrated sedimentological and petrophysical analysis defined five rock types (RT1-RT5). RT1 and RT2 correspond to tidal quarztarenites and fluvial sandstones with few discontinuous clay laminae, high permeability, and high porosity values. RT3 includes tidal fine-grained sandstones with abundant clay and organic matter in the matrix, which decreases flow capacity. RT4 is characterized by very fine- to fine-cemented tidal sandstones in which the diagenetic events close the porosity and permeability. RT5 is a muddy sequence of tidal/fluvial environments, marine shales, and well-cemented glauconitic sandstones. These rocks present negligible permeability and low porosity. In conclusion, the reservoirs deposited in tidal bars and fluvial channels have major flow capacity and storage characteristics, whereas the rocks of the shallow marine and sand flat environments present poor reservoir quality. 
This integrated petrophysical and sedimentological work presents an alternative method for identifying rock types by using flow capacity and the integration of conventional core data, sedimentological analysis, petrographic and diagenetic description, capillary pressure, well logs, and reservoir information. The results from this method were incorporated in the geocellular model for reservoir simulation.|","RQI, Capillary pressure, Rock, Types, Lithofacies"

In this paper, a successful peripheral waterflooding3 application in the HN oilfield, was illustrated. Geological study, waterflooding design, project deployment and waterflooding optimization were thoroughly discussed in detail. |M1 of Mesozoic Cretaceous Napo Formation is a litho-structural composite reservoir, mid-high permeability, with thin sand layers4. The production was initialized in 1995 with natural depletion drive, and a 6.4% recovery of OOIP was achieved. In order to enlarge the waterflooding sweep volume, three injection wells were designed. Well location is optimized on the basis of fine interpretation of low relief structure and prediction of sand with average thickness of 15 ft by MPS method5. A proper injection-production ratio(IPR) was determined by using reservoir simulation to restore the reservoir energy but avoiding to reach high water-cut values on producer wells. Volume and properties of the aquifer was estimated by static-dynamic analysis. A ""balanced injection"" method was applied and real-time waterflooding adjustment was carried out to enhance waterflooding performances. |As liquid production and pressure declined sharply after 8 years' primary drive, in 2003, one injection well was drilled to performance peripheral water injection. The volume and properties of the aquifer were re-estimated according to the production history data and geological analysis. Oil production started to increase and reservoir pressure was restored. The BOPD in 2003 was 950bbl/d, and peaked at 2,300bbl/d in 2007. Later, another two injection wells were drilled to enlarge the sweep volume. But one of them was changed to inject in another zone. Injection volume, pressure, and injection mode were studied and optimized, the oil production peaked at 5,400bbl/d in 2010 as the results of injection optimization. The efforts of real-time waterflooding adjustment extended the high oil production period. By July 2015, RF reached 32.7% with 83.4% water-cut and an ultimate recovery was forecasted to be 45%.

This paper discusses the successful, fully integrated petrophysical and geological modeling of the Hollin formation in the Sacha field of Ecuador. The goal of the modeling project was to unravel aquifer heterogeneities and hydrodynamic effects; it focuses on suitable petrophysical rock typing, supporting the establishment of a tilted water/oil contact (WOC) that follows a particular architecture across the field. 
Documenting WOC changes is extremely important during reservoir modeling. Changes in fluid levels can be related to, among other things, structural complexities, rock heterogeneities, and hydraulic movement effects. However, when dealing with a mature field characterization that has undergone an accelerated production, flow capacity differences and remaining reserves become critical points to delineate aquifer heterogeneities. The identification of aquifer heterogeneities and possible hydrodynamic flow were considered separately to address this problem, using available core data, a log-derived water saturation (Sw) model, and dynamic performance integrated with a rock typing approach. 
Such factors were considered when studying the Cretaceous Lower Hollin formation in the Sacha field. The Sacha field is a mature field in Oriente basin, Ecuador, and the reservoir is characterized by a sequence of amalgamated sandstones deposited primarily by a braided stream system. A strong aquifer underlies this sequence of amalgamated sandstones and maintains a stable pressure. As a result, various WOCs are displayed at different levels in the wells with a variation of up to 70 ft across the field. Aquifer heterogeneities were identified as facies changes, faults, and capillarity effects that perhaps triggered these WOC irregularities. Although these anomalies do not prevent vertical fluid communication within the reservoir, they represent an important step for proper electrical rock property interpretation; thus, providing a more realistic reservoir Sw model. The construction of rock-fluid surfaces helps to identify the aquifer heterogeneities related to steady state WOC depths. The textural features of the rock in conjunction with an identified water recharge point created an WOC surface that vary the inclination rates from 2 ft/km northward, 13 ft/km eastward, and southward across the field, creating a predictable WOC architecture that affected water production. 
This improved understanding of key petrophysical aspects and methods arising from work undertaken to solve various problems related to the tilted WOC have revealed new opportunities to the field edges. These opportunities have been tested with newly drilled wells with excellent results. The results obtained from these tests are having a significant effect on future drilling programs.|","Water drive Reservoirs, hydroninamism, petrophysics, Tilted OWC, rock typing"

New technologies, including drilling horizontal wells, have evolved to enhance hydrocarbon production. Drilling profitable horizontal wells requires using available information to minimize uncertainty and proactive geosteering techniques to maximize production by navigating within the sweet spot. 
When available information is based on 2D seismic and well correlation, advanced geosteering techniques are used to anticipate resistivity changes along the well trajectory, which can be used before and during the drilling process to successfully place a horizontal well. The geosteering process is performed using azimuthal wave propagation resistivity and gamma ray. For landing, an adequate stratigraphic correlation has been crucial. However, for the lateral section, geosignals and azimuthal resistivity measured at different depths of investigation from the top and base of the borehole have helped determine the section with best reservoir characteristics. This paper presents the results obtained in four horizontal wells in which proactive geosteering techniques have helped to position and navigate the wells along the sweet spot. 
The Lower U Sandstone (Cenomanian) at the Sacha field has become the target for horizontal wells because of the reservoir characteristics present. Offset wells located in the flanks of the structure do not show the presence of water/oil contact in well logs; however, production data proves otherwise. Likewise, the deepest resistivity readings have shown a more conductive zone in the lower portion of the reservoir, which has never been crossed with a horizontal well. After a well is closer to the latter zone, azimuthal and average deep resistivities measure less resistivity than in the upper portion, whereas gamma ray values remain constant; these results are interpreted as clean sandstone. This information helped the team make the right decisions to minimize possible water breakthrough from this zone. 
The horizontal well drilling process, using advanced proactive geosteering techniques, has helped determine that the flanks of the structure present a less prospective zone and contain less hydrocarbon saturation. Finally, the experience gained by the team, using these techniques and tools could help improve performance in future horizontal wells.|","sweet spot, geosignals, geosteering, horizontal wells, deep resistivity"

Production modeling is a process that requires analyzing several steps, from reservoir characterization, completion and hydraulic fracturing, up to the optimization in the production system. Traditionally these processes can be analyzed independently with separated specialized tools. However in unconventional reservoirs, as the Vaca Muerta shale, dependency between the stimulation treatment and the well productivity is critical. This work proposes a workflow to evaluate the joint impact of hydraulic fractures with the static and dynamic characterization of the reservoir. 
The available static information (geophysics, petrophysics, geomechanics and natural fracture interpretation) is integrated to build a geological model. Then, hydraulic fracturing is simulated numerically using the Unconventional Fracture Model (UFM). The model takes into account the interaction between the existing natural fractures and the created hydraulic fractures during the stimulation treatment. The resulting geometry of the hydraulic fractures is gridded in an unstructured manner. The model reproduces explicitly the volume and permeability with the appropriate distribution along each branch of hydraulic fractures according to the executed completion. Dynamic simulation can be run to perform a history match of the available production data. Hydraulic fracture geometry, driven by geomechanics and natural fractures, is a key component of the process and might be reviewed if no production match can be achieved making the overall workflow iterative. Additionally, automation through assisted history matching is proposed to investigate different possible solution and reduce the timeframe of the study. 
Once calibrated with production, the model allows several applications. The different possible solutions considered by the assisted history match process permit the evaluation of the uncertainty of final recovery when forecasting production. Sensitivity analysis over a given hydraulic fracture geometry shows the major role of the matrix saturation and conductivity degradation over the final recovery. Completion can be optimized by considering different scenarios and showing the direct correlation between generated propped surface and well productivity. Different fracture designs can be investigated to increase the propped surface highlighting the importance, not only of the proppant volume, but also of the proppant transport capability of the fracturing fluids to be used.|","Hydraulic fracturing, Shale gas, Completion optimization, Dynamic simulation, Production evaluation"

Cuttings re-injection (CRI) technology is a reliable waste management option for eliminating environmental liabilities and reducing surface contamination risks associated with traditional disposal techniques. The technology complies with the strictest regulations enabling oil and gas exploitation in areas where it was not before possible. 
Three wells were drilled in the Chambira field (Block 8). Drilled cuttings from those wells were stored in pits for three years due to the lack of a conventional disposal method that meets Peruvian regulations. Two years later in 2013, CRI technology was selected as the waste management option for disposing the cuttings. An old abandoned well, CHAM-124XCD, was conditioned and prepared for re-injection. Cuttings were removed from the pits and transferred to the processing unit where they were mixed with water and additives to form a suitable slurry, which was injected down the hole into an interbedded formation. This first CRI application in Block 8 eliminated the environmental liability of the Chambira field. All drilled cuttings accumulated from previous drilling operations were successfully injected. Approximately 100,000 bbl. of waste (including spacers and displacement fluids) was disposed into the Chambira formation. As a result, three (full-size) cutting pits were cost-effectively cleaned. 
This paper shows that the selected cyclic injection technique enabled disposal of all cuttings without disturbing the initial stress state of the formation. After the injection, minimal changes in horizontal stress and fracture propagation pressure were observed; thereby, demonstrating that the injection strategy was appropriate for the formation. The results from this operation indicate that cuttings re-injection technology can be a very effective method for eliminating drilling cuttings in remote and mature fields. 
This paper presents a successful CRI application in a remote Peruvian oil field as a reliable and cost-effective solution for cuttings disposal. Properly customizing available equipment at the site enabled complete disposal of the accumulated cuttings, which were major environmental and financial liabilities for the operator. The customization methods developed during the re-injection operation in Chambira field are new and applicable for similar formations in other fields.|","waste management, Environmental Liabilities, hydraulic fracturing, cuttings re-injection, solids injection"

An operator is drilling exploration wells near Xanab field in Mexico's Southwest Marine region. The 8<U+00BD>-in. hole section is difficult to drill, with damaging shocks and vibrations occurring in the hard/interbedded Cretaceous carbonates. These formations, with relatively high unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of 15,000 to 28,000 psi combined with alternating lithologies with chert nodules, have been drilled mostly with roller cone IADC-527X bits. Although the roller cone produced vibration-free operations, suboptimal rates of penetration (ROP) and short run lengths resulted in multiple trips to total depth (TD) of the section. Attempts were made to design polycrystalline diamond compact bits (PDCs) that could endure the difficult downhole environment by increasing diamond volume per blade. However, when encountering the hard formations, high vibration levels were still causing broken cutters in the nose/shoulder areas. 
In a new exploration well, a new fixed cutter bit was used. The bit is equipped with stinger conical diamond elements (CDE) with an ultrathick diamond layer that improves impact resistance, along with PDC cutters. A modeling system based on finite-element analysis (FEA) was used to design a new-type eight-bladed hybrid bit by positioning CDEs and PDCs from bit center to gauge on all eight blades. The unique cutter pattern would fail the rock with a combination of plowing and shearing action. To ensure all CDEs engage the formation at the beginning of the run, the elements were positioned at a height equal to the top edge of the conventional PDC cutters. This strengthens the bit by leveraging the superior impact strength of the CDEs. To deliver sufficient torque and to keep a vertical trajectory, a rotary steerable system (RSS) was selected, with an integrated positive displacement motor (PDM) to supply additional power. 
The bottomhole assembly (BHA) was run on the Keluk-1 well and drilled to TD in two runs, 30% faster (2.59 m/hr) than the average ROP of the nine 8<U+00BD>-in bit runs (seven with PDC and two with roller cone bits) in Xanab field (2.0 m/hr). The first bit run made 206 m and could have finished the entire section but was pulled for downhole tool failure. The second bit drilled 65 m to TD. This compares favorably to the nine-well offset average of 176 m. The RSS/motor combination worked as planned, providing the CDE bit with the necessary energy to maximize ROP while reducing stick/slip occurrence to less than 20% during the run. The reduced vibrations enabled the operator to maintain RPM (150 to 170) and weight on bit (WOB) (10 to 16 ton) when drilling the critical middle/lower Cretaceous mudstone with chert nodules. Previous runs in this section required reduced parameters to mitigate vibration, thus slowing ROP. 
Both bits were pulled out in excellent dull condition (0-1/0-0) verifying that the CDEs provided the added durability needed to drill through the challenging application. The increase in drilling performance saved 90 hours of rig time equaling USD 320,000. Field testing of other CDE bits are producing favorable performance results combined with larger drill cuttings for improved formation evaluation.|","Conical Diamond Element Bit, Increasing Drilling Efficiency in Hard Carbonates, Offshore Mexico, Improving ROP with High Torque RSS"

As a result of the creation of a hydraulic fracture, transient geomechanics forces are exerted on the formation, which modify the stress landscape near the wellbore and the fracture plane. It has been observed that the potential exists for temporary reversal in the minimum stress direction, enabling a brief time interval in which a second hydraulic fracture can be created in a completely different direction. This provides hydraulic fracturing connectivity to previously unattainable locations in the formation, which can significantly improve initial hydrocarbon production and economic ultimate recovery from the formation. 
This paper presents a computational validation of this multioriented hydraulic fracturing (MOHF) process. A unique transient 3D computational geomechanic fracture simulator was developed to perform this study, as traditional hydraulic fracture simulations are derived using static formation properties and steady-state assumptions. The new model incorporates cohesive zone elements to represent the fracture plane and friction elements to account for plastic energy storage of the multiple formation rock layers in the model. Time lapse stress fields show distinct windows of opportunity wherein new fractures can be influenced to extend in alternate directions. 
This new stimulation method enhances the state-of-the-art in hydraulic fracturing. However, a deeper understanding of the transient geomechanic response in the treatment area is necessary to successfully design and perform the stimulation operation. Unfortunately, it also creates new complications with respect to industry standard hydraulic fracture models being incapable of modeling the transient response of the system. Furthermore, the availability of data related to the dynamic behavior of rocks is limited, and unique testing equipment and procedures must be developed to obtain such data.|","Modeling, Stress Modification, Stimulation, Complex Fracturing, Geomechanics"

In the meantime, widely-distributed organic-rich shales are being considered as one of the important carbon sequestration targets. Some studies have been done to characterize rockfluid properties, and flow mechanisms in the shale reservoirs. Most of these studies, through modifying methods used for conventional reservoirs, fail to capture dynamic features of shale rock and fluids. In confined nano-pore space in shale reservoirs, interaction between the wall of shale and the contained fluid significantly affects fluid properties. The incapability to model capillarity with the consideration of imperative pore size distribution characteristics using commercial software may lead to inaccurate results for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). This paper presents a novel formulation that consistently evaluates capillary force in the light of using pore size distribution (PSD) directly from core measurements, and develops an adsorption model to achieve a realistic representation of CO2 storage mechanisms. The assumptions in Langmuir isotherm model affect the validity when it is applied to unconventional reservoirs, especially CCUS. An adsorption model was developed to incorporate adsorption behavior using a local density optimization algorithm. Our advances were also designed for multi-component interactions to adsorption sites for a full spectrum of reservoir pressures of interests. This feature allowed us to fully understand the storage and sieving capabilities for CO2 system with remaining reservoir fluids. |Introduction It is widely regarded that the increasing emission of CO

The objective of this study is to propose an alternative way for the probabilistic structural design of tunnel supports in combination with a deterministic numerical analysis code, FLAC2D. We proposed an approach for linking a point estimate method to the FLAC2D solver and developed a software program, called TunnelRA, which facilitates the probabilistic reliability assessment of tunnel supports. The validity of the present approach was investigated based on a lined-circular tunnel problem with an analytical solution and was demonstrated in the accurate estimation of the statistical moments of the performance functions related to the lined-tunnel. Additionally, we applied the present approach to the structural design of a steel liner which is installed in a pressurized tunnel for storing compressed natural gas at a pressure of 15 MPa. In this application, we investigated the probability of failure for the steel liner by varying the liner’s strength and thickness, and provided information for decision making in structural design. The results of the present work demonstrated that the present numerical approach could be used for designing tunnel supports and for making relevant decisions in a quantitative manner.
1. INTRODUCTION
Most of geotechnical parameters, such as the mechanical properties of soils and rocks, are uncertain. The uncertainties should be properly taken into account in geotechnical and structural designs. Probabilistic approaches are more useful in dealing with the uncertainties than conventional deterministic approaches in which the geotechnical parameters are conservatively assigned as single-fixed values determined by a designer’s engineering judgment. Probabilistic approaches quantify the geotechnical uncertainties by statistical probability distributions. As a result, the reliability of structures can be quantitatively assessed in terms of the probability of failure in a limit-state. Regarding the probabilistic analysis of tunnel supports, there have been several researches such as Laso et al. [1], Li & Low [2], and Oreste [3]. For the probabilistic stability evaluation of tunnel supports, Laso et al. [1] and Li & Low [2] used a ground-support interaction diagram for a circular excavated tunnel for which analytical solutions are available, but it is not possible to apply their approaches to non-circular tunnels. Oreste [3] suggested a probabilistic approach for the reliability assessment of tunnel supports by using a hyperstatic reaction method. However, as indicated in his study, the hyperstatic reaction method has such limitations that the active loads which are applied to tunnel supports should be exactly evaluated and the normal and shear stiffness values between the surrounding ground and tunnel supports should be defined in advance. The previous studies have focused on the probability-based reliability assessment of tunnel supports using analytical solutions that can be applicable only to limited conditions, rather than combined with numerical methods that are more useful for solving a variety of underground problems with various shapes and analysis conditions.|","Document Type

This paper presents the results of a study of the morphology of weathering profiles of some sandstones of Sunshine Coast, Southeast Queensland, Australia. Several cut slopes were analyzed in order to provide accurate knowledge of its morphological characteristics. From these, five outcrops were selected to a more detailed study focused on physical, geological, structural and geotechnical parameters, including several characteristics of the rock matrix and rock mass. Samples from the upper portion of the profiles, into the transition zone between rock and soil, were collected in order to determine physical indices, preparation and description of thin sections, description of macroscopic characteristics and point load tests. The results show that sandstones weathering profiles are relatively thin and the contacts between different material layers are sharp. A strong structural conditioning of weathering can be noted in all outcrops. A remarkable characteristic of the weathering profiles is the presence of stress relief joints parallel to bedding, which plays an important role in the differentiation of rock mass layers and weathering. Physical parameters, especially apparent porosity and density, have proved to be good indicators of weathering of rock matrix weathering.
1. INTRODUCTION
The importance of the study of weathering profiles is mainly related to the presence of transitional weathered materials between the rock and the soil, which present different geotechnical parameters and, as a consequence, different geotechnical behavior. The presence of these weathering profiles at a geotechnical work site such as cut slopes, foundations and open and underground excavations, drives geotechnical stability, as weathering produces material with extremely different mechanical parameters [1, 2, 3, 4 and 5]. Add to this scenario is the presence of structural discontinuities that, besides influencing underground water circulation and hence weathering, introduces great variations in mechanical behavior. This context presents an important and complex geotechnical instability mechanism of rock masses that has been responsible for many geotechnical problems under different weathering (climatic) conditions.|","Document Type

S., Exxon Neftegas Ltd.| Xu, S., ExxonMobil Exploration Company","|Abstract
A large number of challenging ERD wells have already been successfully drilled in the Chayvo field using stability mud weights determined by a field-specific wellbore stability model. The original wellbore stability model was based on local insitu stresses, sonic log and shale surface area based rock strength correlations; this model was calibrated and validated against field experience. A key challenge identified in drilling Chayvo multilateral ERD wells was the reduced margin between the required higher stability mud weights and the depleted formation fracture gradient, compared to the original Chayvo ERD wells. Additionally, a high quality borehole was essential for installation of the complex multilateral equipment. The challenge was to come up with a reliable method to determine rock strength along the horizontal boreholes, as data required to apply conventional methods was sparse. This provided the incentive to explore the rock physics methodology to generate synthetic sonic logs for a well-specific rock strength characterization. These synthetic logs were incorporated into the Integrated Hole Quality and Quantitative Risk Analysis (IHQ-QRA) technology to determine the optimum mud weights for Chayvo horizontal multi-lateral wells. This paper describes how this approach resulted in successfully completing the complex Chayvo field multilateral ERD wells.

W., Fracture Systems Ltd.| Martin, C. Derek, University of Alberta","|Abstract
Opalinus Clay is the designated host rock for high-level radioactive waste in Switzerland. Its geomechanical behavior during excavation works has been extensively studied over the past two decades at the underground research laboratory (URL) at Mont Terri in Northwestern Switzerland. Tunnel convergence measurements were compiled from 17 locations at the URL, suggesting that diametral strain is strongly influenced by the rock mass anisotropy. Monitoring of pore fluid pressure indicates strong hydro-mechanical coupling and potentially a large excavation damage zone (EDZ) up to several tunnel radii from the tunnel axis. Transferring experiences gained at Mont Terri URL to candidate repository sites over a large depth range some 50 to 100 km further to the east is complicated by several factors. These include stress-dependent mechanical properties of Opalinus Clay and different tectonic overprint between the URL and the candidate regions. A pragmatic workflow was established to account for observations at the URL, and drawing on geomechanical data from cores at the URL and from wells at greater depths to evaluate engineering feasibility of repositories at different depths. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Opalinus Clay was identified as the preferred host rock for spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste (SF/HLW) and as one possible host rock for long-lived and intermediate to low level waste (L/ILW) in Switzerland. A total of five potential repository sites with Opalinus Clay as host rock are being evaluated in stage 2 of the Swiss Sectoral Plan for Deep Geological Repositories in a selection process. All these sites are located in Northeastern Switzerland, with potential storage depths in the range of approximately 400 to 900 m.
As part of the process, the different sites must be evaluated based on criteria related to safety and technical feasibility. Protection from erosional processes is considered a key criterion to specify a minimum depth for a potential repository. On the other hand engineering feasibility of underground structures is considered a key criterion to limit the maximum depth. In contrast to most other underground excavations, repository tunnels must not only meet standards related to operational safety and serviceability, but must also meet requirements stemming from considerations of long-term safety analysis of potential flow of radionuclides.|","Document Type

Studies of hydraulic fracturing in fractured porous medium have commonly been made using in-situ fracture pressure upon the fracture (wing-crack) surfaces. Here we propose a novel technique, which may provide advantages such as increasing the rate of crude oil production from shallow to deep high pressure/high temperature reservoirs. More specifically, we show the results of numerical and experimental pulse power fracturing study in which the fracture propagation can be controlled, with application to unconventional reservoirs. In the experimental setup 1KJ energy is produced during electric discharge. In the experiments, the pressure rose up to more than 100 Kpsi (690 MPa), high enough for generating numerous new fractures. We have run several tests on cylindrical specimens of limestone and shale, each specimen being 15 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter. The results show that the measured fracture propagation rate using this method is considerably higher than we using conventional quasi static fracture propagation methods. Further field scale tests on this method are required to determine maximum fracture lengths.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is one of the well-known standard operations after perforation in oil and gas wells, especially for unconventional reservoirs. One idea might be to use high injection pressure to create a simple two wings hydraulic fracture. However, such a method requires the use great volumes of fluid and increases the risk of propagation into underground water sources.
Such disadvantages have led researchers to try to find novel methods for hydraulic fracture operations by joining several new ideas derived from basic solid mechanics and fluid dynamics. One of the most important and novel methods in this context is hydropulse pressure fracturing. This is a dynamic fracture propagation method in which the excessive pressure is produced using an electrical discharge. In fact, unlike the traditional quasi-static fracture propagation, this method has the advantage of creating a two-wing planar hydraulic fracture. It is a dynamic fracture propagation method and is applicable in naturally fractured reservoirs. Creating multiple fractures is also possible with this method based on the power which was used.|","Document Type

During the past years a better understanding of the fracturing processes to enhance productivity in hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs has become more important for the industry. Within this context hydraulic fracturing type experiments on 150 mm edge length cube shaped blocks with a 13 mm diameter central borehole under different true-triaxial confining stresses up to 20 MPa have been conducted in this study. Deformations and Acoustic Emission (AE) were monitored throughout the experiments. Rock types that have been tested comprise rhyolites, sandstones and slates with low porosity and permeability. Fracturing has been conducted with water as a fracturing fluid and via pressurization of an elastic polymer sleeve to eliminate poroelastic effects. AE data evaluation revealed several characteristics of fracture initiation and propagation as ’trapping’ and ’deflection’ of the induced fractures at pre-existing fractures, branching and deviation of the induced fracture away from the expected orientation, differences in source types as well as fracture propagation parallel to the borehole. Also the activation of pre-existing fractures prior to fracture initiation and different kinds of fracture initiation patterns were observable.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is applied in a broad range of applications as in hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoir productivity enhancement, stress measurements or stress relief in e.g. tunneling. Within this range of applications companies are confronted with changing lithological material properties, stress magnitudes, fracture dimensions and public vulnerability in the case of induced seismicity. The process of hydraulic fracturing is well understood for homogeneous and isotropic media [1]. Most rocks exhibit a certain degree of heterogeneity and anisotropy caused by bedding, cleavage or pre-existing discontinuities as joints or faults. For field hydraulic fracturing operations the dimensions of the induced fractures can be in similar dimensional scale to the before mentioned attributes. Therefore, fracture propagation direction, fracture geometry and injection pressures may be strongly affected by anisotropy [2]. 
Since the late 1970`s hydraulic fracturing experiments are conducted in the laboratory in combination with AE monitoring [3, 4, 5]. Throughout the decades AE monitoring of laboratory hydraulic fracturing experiments became more and more sophisticated by incorporating methods known from disciplines like seismology, seismics and non-destructive testing. These methods comprise precise arrivaltime detection algorithms [6, 7], different localization approaches allowing for anisotropic velocity fields [8, 9, 10], collapsing techniques [11, 12, 13], source type evaluation methods [14], couplants [15] and AE-tomography approaches [16, 17]. Furthermore, the availability of affordable monitoring hardware gave rise to the usage of the AE monitoring technique for laboratory experiments in geosciences.|","Document Type

In this work, a special device that can simulate plane-strain condition is designed to observe the fracture initiation and propagation directly in a rock plate specimen. The confining pressures are used to simulate the influences of in-situ stresses, and the pre-cracks are for perforations. An opening device can switch hydraulic pump pressure on the boundary of the center hole, which produces a tensile stress on the pre-cracks and initiates their propagation. It needs to note that the influences of fluid are not considered in the experiments, due to the limit of difficulties of sealing issues. Several experiments were conducted using the device under different confining pressures and perforation angles. The experimental results showed that when the confining pressures and the perforation angles were small, the fractures initiated from the pre-cracks and propagated along the maximum confining stress. As the confining pressures and perforation angles increased, the fractures initiated from center hole of rock specimen rather than pre-cracks. Based on the maximum tensile stress criterion, the numerical analyses matched the experimental results well. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing treatments have become an indispensable part of stimulating in shale gas and other unconventional reservoirs. However, they can be greatly influenced by the selected perforating parameters. Especially, the initiation and propagation of fracture in the near wellbore region will influence the development of fractures, and finally the treatments of hydraulic fracturing [1, 2]. Thus, the identification of fracture path during the hydraulic fracturing will provide the fundamental information that can help to improve the hydraulic fracturing treatments.
Many researchers have studied the influence factors on the fractures evolution near wellbore, and the results showed that perforating parameters, cement properties and confining pressure are the key factors [3-6]. For instance, the initiation pressure and hydraulic fracture reorientation path are controlled by the perforation orientation [7]. When the confining stress and perforating angle increased, the initiation from perforations became difficult and finally initiated from weak cemented position.|","Document Type

Well stimulation by hydraulic fracturing is a common method for increasing the injectivity and productivity of wells. This method is beneficial for many applications including oil, gas, geothermal energy and CO2sequestration, however, hydraulic fracturing in shale and other similarly complex geologies remains poorly understood. A 300<U+00D7>300<U+00D7>300 mm3block specimen of Fort Hays Limestone was hydraulically fractured in the laboratory using a true-triaxial apparatus to study complex hydraulic fracturing. This material is a member of the Niobrara Shale formation, a major unconventional oil and gas play in the Denver-Julesburg Basin. Hydraulic fractures were stimulated by injection of plastic epoxy. Injected epoxy clearly marked the fluid penetrated zones of the stimulated fractures, partially preserved the in-situ fracture aperture and bonded the fracture faces to give improved visualization of complex fractures in cross-sections cut after the experiment. The experiment resulted with a complex fracture network including prominent tensile hydraulic fractures, shear activated discontinuities and bedding plane separations. Acoustic emissions, injection pressures and injection rates were analyzed with reference to the fracture geometry to develop relationships between these parameters and to develop means of identifying complex fracture growth, as applicable in field scenarios where the actual fracture geometry is not easily measured. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation method where fluid is injected into rock to create new fractures. These fractures are intended to function as high-conductivity fluid pathways enabling increased well productivity or injectivity. The hydraulic fracturing method can be used to improve oil, gas, geothermal, carbon sequestration, and deep waste injection well performance. Design and optimization of a hydraulic fracture treatment is non-trivial due to complexity stemming from multi-physical interactions between the in-situ rock and injected fluids.
A comprehensive understanding of hydraulic fracture geometry is critical for understanding and predicting fluid flow behavior through stimulated wells. Fracture geometries in field treatments are expected to be complex, including combinations of tensile and shear fractures [1,2]. This expectation is supported by mine-back studies [3,4] and microseismic monitoring where acoustic emission (AE) sources are typically dispersed through a volume of rock and do not clearly indicate discrete fractures. Some stimulation treatments are thought to produce complex networks of inter-connected fractures, accessing large rock volumes.|","Document Type

Based on the principles of bouncing back the non-equilibrium parts of particle populations in the normal direction and momentum preservation, Zou & He [Phys Fluids 9(1997)] proposed and validated a set of analytical pressure and velocity boundary conditions for the D2Q9 and D3Q15 LBGK models. In this article, the analytical pressure and velocity face boundary conditions are explicitly extended to the D3Q19 LBGK model, following the same methodology. The correctness and accuracy of the derived boundary conditions are verified in steady duct flow problem and unsteady Stokes’ second problem; in both problems the numerical solutions are compared well with the analytical solutions. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Over the last two decades, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has been emerging as an important computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique for modeling nearly incompressible fluid flows and simulating physics of fluids, especially when interfacial dynamics and complex boundaries are involved [1,2]. Unlike the direct discretization of Navier-Stokes equations in the traditional CFD approaches, such as finite difference, finite volume and finite element methods, in LBM packets of fluid particles move across the lattice following simple but special kinetic rules at the mesoscale such that the relations among macroscopic variables of fluids automatically recover Navier-Stokes equations [3]. 
The mesoscopic kinetic nature of LBM brings many advantages over the conventional CFD methods, such as simplicity of the implementation algorithm, capacity of handling complex physical mechanisms, ease of parallelization, etc. On the other hand, the mesoscopic nature of LBM makes it awkward to implement boundary conditions. In traditional continuum-based CFD methods, the common velocity and pressure conditions (or their derivatives) can be imposed to the boundaries directly (or after simple straightforward discretization). In LBM, however, the boundary conditions described by macroscopic variables have to be appropriately translated into the equivalent conditions in term of mesoscopic quantities and enforced at the mesoscale. In this translation procedure, the mathematical relations among the macroscopic variables (e.g., density and velocities) and the mesoscopic quantities (particle distributions) must be satisfied and the known particle distributions need to be respected. Since the number of unknown particle distributions is greater than the number of mathematical macroscopicmesoscopic relations, additional physical or numerical rules need to be introduced to determine the unknown particle distributions. Examples of such additional rules include momentum preservation, local thermohydrodynamic equilibrium, finite difference extrapolation [4-8].|","Document Type

Wettability of rock and drilling fluid attracts great attention, especially in the field of micro scale on wellbore stability. The core samples from western China were investigated using X-ray diffraction tests, water activity tests, wetting test, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope tests and uniaxial compressive strength tests. The results indicate that wettability has a great influence on micrometer or even nanometer cracks, the stress accumulated by which affects micro fractures extension, whereas traditional theory had ignored usually. According to the mineral composition and wettability of the samples, and the changes of the microscope structure and rock mechanics parameters resulted from the samples contacting with oil-based drilling fluid, a comprehensive fracture mechanics model between rock and drilling fluid based on wettability was proposed. The model indicates that the fractures extension was a combined action result of the opening and sliding mode cracks, and that the stress intensity factors were affected by in-situ stress, net fluid pressure, wettability, and even fracture geometry. Wettability was used as an effective solution to the frequent occurrence of the wellbore instability in fractured formation, even under the density and conventional performances of oil-based drilling fluid within a reasonable range.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wettability is defined as the tendency of one fluid to spread on or adhere to a solid surface in the presence of other immiscible fluids, which is the fluid's ability to keep contacting with the solid surface, and is caused by the molecular interaction when the fluid and the solid contact with each other [1, 2]. As the research on wellbore stability proceeds gradually in the drilling engineering field, the influence of the wettability on rock attracts great attention. In the 1980s, Anderson, W.G. made a systematic summary of relevant literatures on the wettability, including rock/oil/brine interactions and the effects of core handling on wettability [3], wettability measurement [4], the effects of wettability on the electrical properties of porous media [5], the effects of wettability on capillary pressure [6], the effects of wettability on relative permeability [7], and the effects of wettability on waterflooding [8]. At the present time, the study on the wellbore stability has entered the microcosmic field [9], and the role of the wettability in this scale is highlighted significantly.
Wettability not only controls reservoir fluid distribution, but also greatly affects physical and chemical properties of rock, including capillary force, relative permeability, electrical properties and even strength. Especially before and after drilling formation, wettability exerts a more significant influence on wellbore stability. In most previous literatures, unchanged wettability was considered as a default premise, impact of wettability and its changes on the rock, thereby on wellbore stability was ignored.|","Document Type

The majority of planar hydraulic fracture models use two distinct approaches. The first one, referred to as the planar 3D model, is more accurate but also very CPU intensive. The second one is referred to pseudo-3D (P3D) model, and separately considers the vertical growth and horizontal propagation of the fractures. This approach is less CPU intensive, but requires the fracture being initiated in the lower stress layer. In practice, this assumption is not always verified, and the fracture height growth can become unstable. This paper presents a new model as an enhancement of the P3D, which consists of multiple rows of elements vertically stacked and connected. For each row of elements, the assumption of the fracture front being in the lower stress layer is satisfied locally. The width profile and stress intensity factor at the top and bottom of the fracture depend on the stress profile and the pressure profile along the stack of elements. This model predicts the fracture height more accurately than the P3D model, and gives results close to the ones from the full planar 3D model. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The rapid development of shale resources in the past decade has brought a focus on the process of hydraulic fracturing. Shale reservoirs tend to be characterized by a complex 3D stress field and vertically heterogeneous mechanical properties, which have always been challenging for hydraulic fracturing modeling and particularly for properly predicting the shape of an induced fracture [1]. Most state-of-the-art planar fracture simulators use two distinct approaches. In the first one, referred to as the planar 3D model (PL3D), the fracture is assumed to be a plane and its entire footprint is discretized into elements. The equations governing fluid flow, elasticity, and mass balance are solved numerically, coupled with the fracture propagation rules. This approach is very accurate but also very CPU intensive [2]. This type of model is mostly used when a large portion of the fracture propagates outside of the zone where the fracture was initiated and significant amount of vertical flow is expected. The second approach is based on the cell-based pseudo-3D (P3D) model [3], which separately considers the vertical growth and horizontal propagation of the fractures. In this approach, the width profile and fracture height are calculated based solely on the local pressure and local vertical stress profile. This approach is less CPU intensive, but relies on several assumptions including the fracture being initiated and its leading front propagating in the lower stress layer compared to the neighboring layers above and below. If this is not the case, the fracture height growth can become unstable, since it is not directly correlated to the global fracture mass balance as in the PL3D model, and this can lead to significant inaccuracy in the predicted fracture height growth.|","Document Type

Natural fractures can reactivate upon stimulation and interact with propagating hydraulic fractures. This interaction usually creates complex, productive fracture networks that can remain open during production. Geomechanical models quantify key parameters that control the extent and characteristics of the conductive reservoir area in naturally fractured reservoirs. The models can be utilized to optimize stimulation design parameters for infill wells or re-fracturing operations. In this paper we present stimulation design optimization within the framework of a coupled “Geomechanics-Microseismic-Reservoir-Discrete Fracture Network (DFN)” workflow. A series of simulations are conducted to understand key parameters that control the conductive reservoir area of a planned infill well. In these simulations both stimulation design parameters (e.g. pumping rate) and well architecture (e.g. stage number, well orientation) are varied as their impact on conductive reservoir area is quantified. Results show that extent of conductive reservoir area in a naturally fractured reservoir can be controlled. The workflow introduced in this paper can guide field operations and optimize stimulation design to (i) maximize conductive reservoir area of an infill well (ii) and limit/control fracture communication between infill wells and existing producers.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracture (HF) characteristics and geometry are a complex function of in-situ stress state, stress shadowing, formation anisotropy, rate and pressure dependent rock mechanical properties, wellbore orientation, and the natural fracture networks [1-5]. In particular, the presence of natural fractures and their interaction with propagating hydraulic fractures can dictate the resulting fracture network patterns and the extent of conductive reservoir area [3-7].
In naturally fractured reservoirs, this interaction can create complex fracture network geometries as observed from Microseismic (MS) data [4, 8-10]. However, in most commercial hydraulic fracturing simulators, fracture path is predefined and planar (Fig. 1). This is an oversimplification of the real processes (in particular for horizontal wells), in which multiple hydraulic fractures can interact with each other and/or with the pre-existing natural fracture network to follow non-planar and complex paths. |","Document Type

A finite difference method (Itasca Flac2D) has been applied to study a horizontal borehole developed through a shale formation during hydraulic fracturing. The structural impact of differential internal fluid pressures on the borehole periphery has been studied utilizing the numerical method. The research is focused on the effect of critical parameters associated with the hydraulic fracturing on the largest principal stress and differential principal stresses in the rock. According to Coulomb’s criterion, failure occurs when the maximum principal stress reaches the ultimate strength of the material for simple tension. Based on this theory, the largest principal stress will initiate cracks in the rock and lead to the failure of rock mass. The goal was to observe the effect of borehole radius, internal injection pressure, and K (horizontal stress/vertical stress), on the induced maximum principal stress and differential principal stress. Largest principal stress is considered one of the key factors to initiate fractures in the rock. It was observed that increasing internal pressure, borehole radius, and K will significantly increase the induced maximum principal stress and differential principal stresses around the borehole.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a common method that has been used in mining, petroleum and geotechnical engineering for several years. It is a process of initiating and propagating fracture in the subsurface rock by utilizing a pressurized fluid. Over the past decade, the extraction of natural gas from shale deposits by using horizontal drilling has improved the economic situation of this technique [1].
Horizontal directional drilling is used in some geological settings to produce methane from a variety of shale deposits. In mining, this technology can also enhance the effectiveness of coal degasification procedures and to aid in the delineation of coal reserves. [2]
According to Hawkes [2], for petroleum applications, drilling is typically performed from a surface location. In the mining industry; however, it may be feasible to drill from either surface or subsurface locations. The basic principles of directional drilling methods in mining and petroleum applications are essentially the same, involving down-hole drive motors mounted on adjustable, bent bottom hole assemblies.|","Document Type

In this work, we modeled double- and triple-cluster 3D hydraulic fracturing in a single-layer, quasi-brittle shale formation using planar CZM and XFEM-based CZM including slit flow and poro-elasticity for fracture and matrix spaces, respectively, in Abaqus. Our fully-coupled pore pressure-stress Geo-mechanics model includes leak-off as a continuum-based fluid flow component coupled with the other unknowns in the problem. Having compared the triple-cluster fracturing results from planar CZM with those from XFEM-based CZM, we found that the stress shadowing effect of multiple hydraulic fractures on each other can cause these fractures to rationally propagate out of plane; this also demonstrates the advantages of the second method compared to the first one. We investigated the effect of this arbitrary propagation direction on not only the fractures’ length, aperture, and the required injection pressure, but also fractures’ connection to the wellbore. Depending on the spacing and the number of clusters per stage, this connection can be gradually disrupted with time due to the near-wellbore fracture closure which may embed proppant particles on the fracture wall, or screen out the fracture at early stimulation times. Comparing all studied cases, we concluded that the double-cluster, simultaneous fracturing with 100-ft spacing provides the most viable fracture set for long-term production.
1. INTRODUCTION
Shale gas resources have profoundly contributed to the prospective independence of the U.S. on oil and gas from foreign resources. The abundant condensate gas production and export from the U.S. shale resources have significantly contributed in the global sharp oil price decline since August 2014 [1]. These resources are known as ultra-low permeable, organic-rich formations with desorption of gas as a major but slow-rate and long-lasting producing mechanism. Economic production from these resources through gas desorption requires a complex network of natural fractures connected to the producing horizontal wellbores by hydraulic fractures in multiple stages, the most common stimulation technology in shale gas reservoirs. The geometry of hydraulic fractures (length, height, aperture, and propagation pattern) significantly contributes to long-term gas production and is inspected roughly by post-fracturing data acquisition methods such as tiltmeter fracturing mapping and micro-seismic monitoring [2]. This later method, however, cannot identify opening-mode or hydraulic fractures since the only detectable events using this method are shear slippage events. The technical restrictions on the hydraulic fracture data acquisition, the limitation on the extendibility of a successful fracturing job data to the other fields [3], and the high cost of re-stimulation plans, if possible, urge to develop numerical tools for optimal hydraulic fracturing design. Furthermore, due to the occurrence of cap rock and shale gas reservoir in close proximity and the environmental concerns about ground water contamination by fracturing jobs, the induced fractures need to be cautiously placed in order not to propagate into the upper and lower geological layers. Such a rigorous hydraulic fracture design in shale rocks demands numerical optimizing tools which should also be versatile for a variety of shale formations in mineralogy and stress state and capture increasingly more complex fracture networks than expected in these resources [2, 4]. Furthermore, a long-term optimum fracture spacing depends on not only the above parameters during fracturing, but also the fluid phase behavior during production in the commonly identified gas condensate windows in shale resources such as Eagle Ford [5], which is out of the scope of our geo-mechanical study.|","Document Type

Natural fractures serve as both reservoir space and flow channel for fluids in shale gas reservoirs. In the process of shale gas reservoir stimulation, the interaction between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures is essential for the generation of fracture network. In this paper, a fracture interaction criterion is derived to predict whether hydraulic fracture would cause shear slippage on natural fracture plane or crossing the natural fracture, and a series of Tri-axial tests on natural shale outcrop blocks are conducted to observe the interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures. The study results show that with a certain stress difference and crack occurrence, larger approaching angle, higher pump rate and lower fracturing fluid viscosity would contribute to hydraulic fracture crossing natural fracture and lead to a larger stimulated volume in shale formation. High brittle deformation of shale formation also increases the complexity of fracture network, and the optimal shale target would be high brittleness but low strength and hardness. Based on the experiment results, we propose the optimum condition for the interaction between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture, which could be much more practical for the formation evaluation and the better fracture design.
1. INTRODUCTION
Natural fractures serve as both the reservoir space and the flow channel of fluids in shale gas reservoirs, which require large-scale hydraulic fracturing to build complex fracture system for gas extracting. For the majority of-shale gas reservoirs, the number of fracture discontinuities is large (Gale et al. 2007). However, for some conditions, the fracture may deviate or twist by only a small amount, having a relatively simple propagation path along many pre-existing fractures (Zhang and Jeffrey 2008; Jeffrey et al. 2009). Factors affecting the fracture geometry include in-situ stress, rock brittleness and natural fracture system (bedding planes and natural fractures) (King, 2010; Britt and Schoeffler, 2009; Rickman et al, 2008).|","Brittleness, Hydraulic fracture,  Fracture network,  Shear-slip,  Tri-axial test"

This study aims to model anisotropic damage (i.e. increase of porosity and loss of stiffness) and healing (i.e. recovery of stiffness) in salt rock subject to microcrack initiation, propagation, and rebonding. We introduce enriched fabric tensors in a Continuum Damage Mechanics model to link micro-crack evolution with macroscopic deformation rates. We carry out creep tests on granular salt assemblies to infer the form of fabric descriptors. We use moments of probability of fabric descriptors to find relationships between microstructural and phenomenological variables. Creep processes in salt include glide, cross-slip, diffusion, and dynamic recrystallization. We assume that healing is predominantly governed by diffusive mass transfer. We model the corresponding crack cusp propagation on grain faces by means of a two-dimensional diffusion equation. We calibrate this grain-scale healing model against experimental measures of crack cusp propagation distance. We simulate the opening, closure and rebonding of three orthogonal families of micro-cracks during a compression-tension loading cycle. Multi-scale model predictions illustrate the evolution of stiffness, deformation, and crack geometry during the anisotropic damage and healing process, and highlight the increased healing efficiency with time. We expect that the proposed modeling approach will provide more precise and reliable performance assessments on geological storage facilities in salt rock.
1. INTRODUCTION
Because of its low permeability, water solubility and self-healing properties, salt rock is a favorable host rock for the geological storage of nuclear waste, oil and natural gas, compressed air (CAES), and hydrogen. Salt properties depend on the state of damage and recovery of the rock, which undergoes temperature and stress cycles around storage facilities. In order to understand and predict the microscopic mechanisms at the origin of damage and healing, we propose to model anisotropic thermo-mechanical damage and healing processes by means of alternative fabric descriptors.
Thermo-mechanical damage and healing models of salt rock proposed in continuum mechanics rely on the concept of dilatancy boundary [1]. Anisotropic healing models based on Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) usually resort to the concept of “net damage”, which allows modeling stiffness degradation (damage) and recovery (healing). These theoretical frameworks are purely hypothetical and do not allow the prediction of all coupled processes that occur in actual rock materials. Rock damage models that distinguish closure and rebonding conveniently model all dissipation processes with rate-dependent evolution laws, which avoids implementing threshold-based yield functions in numerical codes. Unfortunately, those models do not properly represent the brittle behavior resulting from rate-independent crack opening and closure. In such models, healing is defined as a particular form of crack closure detected by an increment in wave velocity, rather than crack rebonding. |","Document Type

The aim of this study is to present an integrated and analytical workflow which includes the following execution steps: 1) generating a geomechanical model for the wellbore based on input data from different sources; 2) determining the stress tensor around the wellbore based on a transient thermo-poro-elastic model which include internal/external mud cake effects; 3) determining drilling safe mud weight window based on various failure criteria; 4) identifying troublesome zones with narrow mud weight window throughout the well trajectory; 5) performing an integrated wellbore strengthening analysis based on different mechanisms (e.g., induced fracture propagation and plugging, thermal, external and internal mud cake effects); 6) performing an integrated mud loss volume prediction based on different mechanisms (e.g., natural fracture loss, induced fracture loss, formation loss); and 7) quantifying the amount of strengthening and re-generating mud weight window for safe drilling. The integrated tool provides a suitable workflow when drilling through depleted zones and for lost circulation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Lost circulation is one of the major causes of nonproductive time in drilling operations. If the near wellbore stress state dictates that they should, induced fractures initiate and propagate away from the wellbore and fluid is lost into the formation. This is particularly true for wells being drilled in complex geological settings (such as deep water or highly depleted zones/intervals). Several geomechanical mechanisms (e.g., near wellbore fracture propagation, thermo-poroelastic processes, mud cake formation, etc.) can act together to control near wellbore stress field, induced fracture characteristics and associated lost circulation risk. If induced fracture characteristics can be accurately predicted, loss circulation materials can be added to the system to plug fractures of different size(s) and width(s) to increase fracture re-initiation pressure (FRIP). This phenomena is also referred as “wellbore strengthening” in the literature.
Induced fracture characteristics are predominantly controlled by the near wellbore stress field. Therefore, one of the prerequisites for a successful design is to establish a workflow (that integrates multiple mechanisms within the framework of a geomechanical engine) to calculate a realistic stress field around the wellbore, to asses induced fracture risk and to come up with an effective wellbore strengthening strategy.|","Document Type

We developed a three-dimensional discrete fracture network simulator that fully implicitly couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture opening and sliding. The simulator describes flow in both newly forming hydraulic fractures and preexisting natural fractures. The boundary element method is used for the mechanical calculations, which makes it possible to perform the simulations without meshing the volume around the fractures. Leakoff is described with a semi-analytical one-dimensional leakoff approximation. To validate the implementation of the boundary element method, we simulated the opening and sliding of a circular crack and compared to analytical solutions. Next, we performed simulations of a single propagating hydraulic fracture (with and without leakoff). The results closely matched analytical solutions for fracture propagation. Finally, we performed simulations of injection induced sliding along a fault. In these simulations, injection was performed at constant pressure and leakoff was neglected. The simulations were performed until the fluid pressure in the fault was uniform and equal to the injection pressure. Consistent with results from the literature, the simulator predicted that the direction of sliding should deviate slightly from the direction of maximum resolved shear stress, as calculated considering only the remote loading conditions. Simulations were performed with the injection point at different locations along the fracture. Even though the final stress state was the same in these simulations, the distribution of sliding direction along the fault was modestly different, an indication of the path-dependence of the problem. Simulations were performed in which the direction of fracture sliding was handled with explicit, rather than implicit, time stepping. The implicit and explicit methods converged to the same answer if sufficiently small timesteps were used, but with larger timesteps, the implicit method was more accurate.

We have used a hydraulic fracture model to quantify fault rupturing promoted by injection and migration of fluid into a fault, which contains in-plane high-conductivity segments and out-of-plane jogs or branches. The fluid under elevated pressure can promote extension-shear fracturing. The model provides numerical results on the opening and pressure variations with position and time. High-conductivity segments aid penetration of the pressurized fluids, but limit fluid pressure increases, so as to sustain a stable rupture growth mode. In the presence of varying normal stresses, stable growth cannot be maintained by pressure variations leading to the unstable growth in shear, and rapid fault movement events can be triggered as the fault re-establishes stable growth, radiating seismic energy and accompanied by local backward slip. These coupled seismic and aseismic faulting processes are applicable to faults with jogs and branches, which interact with the main fault to produce changes in the local stress states. The opening and slip along jogs and branches, either pre-existing or induced by fluid flow, will not only contribute to fluid storage due to their suction pumping action, but also produce changes in the downstream flow rates. The slip along them can produce associated opening along the main fault, but their opening can increase the compressive stress across the main fault which restricts its opening. The deformation transfer at junctions can complicate the fracture and flow responses.
1. INTRODUCTION
Injection of liquid waste has been found to result in generation of seismic events and some of these may be large enough to be felt at the surface [1, 2]. The total volume injected and the maximum size of the seismic events generated have been found to be correlated [3]. Microseismic monitoring of low-level induced seismicity generated by hydraulic fracturing is a technology applied in unconventional gas reservoirs [4- 6] for the purpose of mapping the extent of fracturing.
Considerable effort has been devoted to detecting and locating seismic events associated with fluid injection. However, little attention has been paid to understanding the source mechanisms of seismic events for a pressurized fault [7, 8]. Hydraulic fracturing in lowpermeability reservoirs is strongly affected by natural fractures within the targeted rock layers. Stimulation improves the connection of these fractures to one another and to the hydraulic fracture. Slip on these natural fractures can be activated by stress changes to generate low-magnitude seismic events. Meanwhile, shearing and shear-induced dilation on the natural fractures enhances conductivity and increases the stimulated volume. The aperture distribution along a fracture, including the initial and subsequent propagation paths, controls the conductivity and pressure distributions resulting from the injection. An integrated coupled hydraulic fracture model is applied in this paper to this problem to predict the relationship among stress, pressure, deformation and rupture growth. |","Document Type

N., TNO – Geological Survey of The Netherlands| Muntendam-Bos, A. G., State Supervision of Mines","|Abstract
The Wadden Sea is a shallow tidal sea in the north of the Netherlands where gas production is ongoing since 1986. Due to the sensitive nature of this area, gas extraction induced subsidence must remain within the “effective subsidence capacity” for the two tidal basins (Pinkegat and Zoutkamperlaag) affected. We present a probabilistic method to monitor the “effective subsidence capacity” and ensure that subsidence is below the long term (18.6 years) volumetric rate for relative sea level rise that can be accommodated by the tidal basins without environmental harm. The role of sedimentation volume rate, relative sea level rise and subsidence volume rate due to gas depletion are taken into account including their uncertainties. The probability of exceeding the acceptable subsidence limit for the period 2012 to 2050 is 2.8% for the tidal basin called Zoutkamperlaag and 1% for the tidal basin of Pinkegat for climate scenarios that fit the current relative sea level rise observations on the Dutch coast. The values are shown to be dominated by the effect of relative sea level rise, and not due to subsidence induced by gas depletion in the Wadden Sea. To current knowledge no harm is done to nature.
1. INTRODUCTION
Subsidence caused by extraction of hydrocarbons is a sensitive issue in the Netherlands due to its proximity to sea level. The Wadden Sea in the north of the Netherlands is a shallow tidal sea behind a chain of coastal barrier islands. It has been inscribed on the UNESCO’s World Heritage list since 2009 because of its unique morphodynamic features and its wildlife. Also, it is one of the most notable nature conservation areas in the Netherlands protected under the European Birds and Habitats Directives. In the Wadden Sea, gas production is ongoing since 1986 from the Ameland gas field (Fig. 1). Since 1990 the subsidence caused by depletion of the Ameland gas field is compensated by sand suppletions under a dynamic ‘maintain the coast line’ preservation policy [1]. In 2006 additional gas production commenced in the Nes, Moddergat, Lauwersoog and Vierhuizen fields (Fig. 1). Due to the sensitive nature of this tidal sea the gas fields in the area (Ameland Nes, Lauwersoog, Vierhuizen, Anjum, Ezumazijl, Mestlawier and Moddergat) are being produced within the so-called “effective subsidence capacity” [2].|","Document Type

The present study aims to apply intelligent method to predict settlement of tunnels. This method can be used for settlement prediction of tunnel future levels. Many parameters affect settlement, but some of them are applicable to empirical equations. Prediction of this phenomenon depends on many parameters and the effect of each parameter on the other ones has made the use of empirical methods impossible. In this regard, the capability of Gene Expression Programming (GEP) method are studied for settlement (ST) prediction. The intelligent methods have been studied on the basis of data obtained from 50 tunnels all over the world, which have been excavated using the NATM method with similar soil properties. These parameters were collected from previous research data, which the values of settlement were obtained from numerical modeling (FLAC2Dsoftware). 30 datasets were applied for modeling and 20 datasets were used for appraising its performance. The values of STare predicted by using soil strength parameters (E, C and o), depth (Z) and diameter (D) of the tunnel. Three equations were also rendered by GEP method. Finally, the results of this method were compared. According to the results, intelligent method are recommended for prediction of the subway settlement.
1. INTRODUCTION
As most railways, roads and especially metro tunnels (below the foundations of surface structures and near major urban facilities) pass through shallow urban areas, their path is not more changeable in order to achieve a reliable ground. The importance of proper analysis, support, construction method and instrumentation is revealed in this case (Palmstrom and Stille, 2006). Construction of shallow tunnels under the crowded urban areas is faced with obstacles such as settlement. Prediction, prevention and protection should be executed in order to control the settlement. Methods of prevention and controlling settlement are completely dependent on estimation. In addition, one of the most important factors in selecting the best type of support system is the amount of settlement caused by tunnel excavation. As tunnel settlement estimation depends on several parameters and each parameter could affect the others, application of the empirical or analytical methods could become impossible. To overcome these restrictions, intelligent method techniques can be used to develop a more accurate method.
In this paper, an intelligent method widely used in solving complex engineering problems, gene expression programming (GEP), has been utilized to propose new model for prediction of tunneling induced settlement. In recent years, intelligent methods have been widely used in field of tunnel engineering (Shi et al., 1998; Suihui and Guorong, 2001; Neaupane and Adhikari, 2006; Suwansawat, 2006; Suwansawat and Einstein, 2006; Santos and Tarci_sio, 2008; Teskouras et al., 2010). Based on these experiences it could be mentioned that artificial intelligence methods are useful approaches for this purpose.|","Document Type

The aim of this work is to present an integrated workflow for the one-dimensional (1-D) analysis of pore-pressure (PP) prediction and mud-weight window (MWW) for sub-salt well sections as well as high-angle inclined well sections. In this integrated workflow, empirical information, such as measured data and records of drilling events from offset wells, plays an essential role in the prediction of PP and MWW at the target well, along with a set of theoretical equations. The major steps in the workflow include the following: 1) With given data from a set of offset wells and a given location for a target well, prediction analysis of PP and MWW are performed with logging data and various measured data from offset wells first. These calculations and calibrations with known data from offset wells generate the values of model parameters for this field, and, thus, the results are empirical. These empirical values of model parameters will be used for subsequent calculations of PP and MWW at target well locations. 2) The tops-table method, which performs depth-shift calculations is used for extrapolating/interpolating gamma ray and sonic logging data from offset wells to the target well location. 3) With logging data generated using the tops-table method and the empirical model data, PP and MWW can be obtained at the target well location. A practical case using the workflow introduced here is also presented. This case is from an oil field in deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
1. INTRODUCTION
Pore-pressure (PP) prediction and mud-weight window design (MWW) are two of the most popular topics in the area of drilling geomechanics. There are plenty of works on these topics done by various researchers [1][2][3][4][5].
For pore pressure prediction, Mouchet and Mitchell [1] introduced major methods used in the prediction of pore pressure, such as the Eaton Method, Ratio Method, etc. Jones, Matthews, and Standifird [2] introduced their work on pore-pressure prediction with basin modeling. Sayers and Woodward [3] reported their work on porepressure prediction with focus on techniques for using seismic data for accurate results. For brevity purposes, the general principle of pore pressure prediction via the Eaton Method is just briefly reviewed.|","Document Type

Surface movement data can be used in data assimilation or inversion exercises to improve the level of knowledge of a compacting reservoir. We have designed, implemented and tested a new algorithm that uses measured optical height differences directly, without having to translate them to heights with regard to a geodetic reference level. This way, the measurement points are independent of reference benchmarks. In addition, the accumulation of inaccuracy of the height difference measurements, which have to be connected to a stable benchmark over multiple connected benchmark pairs, is circumvented. Thus, the new method is less error prone. Individual errors in height difference measurements do not propagate into interpreted heights. The procedure was applied to a synthetic case study and compared with the traditional inversion using interpreted height measurements. The reduction in standard deviation between prior and estimated values for the different adjusted parameters was better for the new procedure.
1. INTRODUCTION
The production of gas from subsurface reservoirs in many cases induces ground movement. The pressure reduction results in reservoir compaction, which is transferred to the surface and visible as subsidence. Ground movement is traditionally measured with optical levelling technology. Well-founded benchmarks are installed, and in repeated measurement campaigns their respective positions are measured. The heights of the benchmarks visited at each campaign are determined by relating them to a single, stable benchmark with a known height with respect to a geodetic reference system like NAP (the Dutch reference system). Surface movement is then estimated by subtracting heights that have been estimated in measurement campaigns at different times.
Subsidence estimates are important for the assessment of the damage caused by, for instance, changing relative groundwater levels and related intrusion of salt water in areas close to the sea. They can, however, also be used to improve our understanding of the physics of the subsurface. This is important for improving subsidence predictions resulting from ongoing operations, but also for reservoir management. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using subsidence estimates for the quantification of aquifer activity and fault sealing properties [1, 2].|","Document Type

Carbonate reservoirs hold more than 70% of the worldwide reserves. The knowledge related to the development of those reservoirs is not very developed due to the complexity of the lithology, the presence of post-sedimentation events such as diagenesis and the complex mechanical behavior. With the development of horizontal drilling in order to maximize the reservoir contacts (MRC), the need for accurate characterization of the horizontal variability of the mechanical properties of the rocks, becomes more critical. Classical 1D geomechanical models are no longer sufficient for the optimization of the drilling.
In this paper we address the issues mentioned above, through a 3D stochastic modeling of one of the critical parameters during the drilling of horizontal wells: The Formation Parting Pressure (FPP). This parameter allows the optimization of the mud-weight during the drilling of a well and optimizes the economic profitability of this well, while reducing the risks related to under or overpressure.
1. INTRODUCTION
Three dimensional modeling of geomechanical parameters of the reservoir is an important task when dealing with drilling wells in carbonate reservoirs (Ait- Ettajer, et al. 2014)(Azim, et al. 2014). An inadequate calibration of drilling parameters such as mud weight, injection pressure might increase the cost of the drilling with a possibility of irremediable damaging of the reservoir. Classical approaches tend to build a one dimension geomechanical model along the well; however the current development of horizontal wells for optimal well sweeping requires a precise geomechanical model in three dimensions, especially for injection procedure in carbonates reservoirs with heterogeneous rock strengths distribution. We propose a workflow for assessing the critical parameters that impact the drillability and the economic cost of developing carbonate reservoir through horizontal drilling. 
After a short description of the representation of the 3D reservoir model, we will describe the process of building the 3D model of Poisson Ratio using laboratory measurements and seismic volumes, and then we will describe the process for 3D assessment of the Fracture Parting Pressure parameter that will help optimizing the drilling parameters. We will show a case study of the application of the workflow for the optimization of the drilling in onshore carbonate reservoir. |","Document Type

This paper focuses on introducing the use of digital imaging processing techniques to obtain the overall size distribution of rock blocks at drawpoints. A photogrammetric analysis code (WipFrag) and an automatic photograph & analysis tool (PortaMetrics) are used to characterise secondary size distribution. Preliminary tests on performance of WipFrag and PortaMetrics in capturing particle size distribution were carried out in this paper.
To the authors’ knowledge, no significant research has been carried out to date relating caved ore size and hardness on mill performance, also referred to as a Mine-to-Mill approach. It is anticipated that the results of this work will feed into a larger initiative at the University of British Columbia pursuing research on Cave-to-Mill, a proposed new approach to integrate cave mining with milling processes to improve production and forecasting capabilities. The variable and relatively uncontrollable nature of cave fragmentation is considered to be a key distinguishing feature of the suggested Cave-to-Mill approach when compared with typical Mine-to-Mill strategies for open-pit mines.
1. INTRODUCTION
Block caving is one of the most cost effective underground mining techniques, typically employed to mine massive low grade deposits. A general block caving mine layout is shown in Figure 1, the ore material being mined sequentially in large blocks, with base areas of thousands of square meters. Caving is initiated by blasting an underground tunnel (called undercut) under the block of ore that is to be excavated. As caving of the ore is initiated, the undercut is connected with the production level by blasting bell-shaped ore passages (drawpoints). The broken ore material falls into the production level through the drawpoints, then transported to the crushers and, subsequently, brought to the surface. As broken ore is removed from the drawpoints, the ore above continues to break and cave in by gravity.
Ore fragmentation in a block caving process includes three stages: i) in-situ fragmentation; ii) primary fragmentation and iii) secondary fragmentation. In-situ fragmentation is the original condition of rock fragmentation before the undercut is blasted. Loading conditions imposed on the rock mass by the caving process leads to primary fragmentation, as a combination of failure along existing discontinuities and fracturing of the intact rock. Secondary fragmentation is the reduction in size of primary fragmentation blocks as they move down through the ore column to the drawpoints.
Secondary fragmentation has long been recognized as a key parameter for evaluating block caving productivity and assessing the possibility of hang-ups, which is caused by large boulders becoming stuck within inside the drawpoints. Whereas fragmentation controls the overall success and profitability of a block caving operation, it is extremely difficult to measure in a reliable and routinely manner. For example, in-situ fragmentation can be estimated based on the characterization of the natural fracture network and the use of Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) techniques [1], while secondary fragmentation can be potentially |","Document Type

Computer modeling can be used to explore and gain new insights into the impacts of rock bolt intersecting joints in rock masses, and to estimate the effectiveness of the rock reinforcement system. In order to achieve this goal, numerical simulation was performed using FLAC3D to investigate the stress evolution in the rock bolts. The coupling algorithm is based on the analytically-derived interface behavior between a rock bolt and the rock material for grouted rock bolts. The shear force generated by slippage along the interface is assumed to have a linear relationship with respect to the relative slipping distance between the rock bolt and the rock. The linear elastic criterion is applied to determine the material behavior of rock bolts before the axial stress reaches the yield value. The pullout tests are simulated to verify the coupling algorithm and the effects of the proposed rock bolt elements. The simulation results show that the proposed rock bolt models can predict the shear forces and axial loading along the rock bolts. For the rock bolts observed in this study, the max axial force was within the design limit of the bolts, thus the support design was shown to be acceptable.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock bolts are used as primary reinforcement to strengthen the jointed/fractured rock mass in civil and mining engineering excavations. Windsor (1997) [1] categorized the current reinforcement devices into three fundamental classes: Continuous Mechanically Coupled (CMC), Continuous Frictionally Coupled (CFC) and Discretely Mechanically or Frictionally Coupled (DMFC). The fully encapsulated rock bolt system belongs to CMC, while expansion shell bolts belong to the DMFC system and the Swellex and Split set rock bolts to the CFC system. Because of the simple installation procedure, effective rock reinforcement and economic factors, cement or resin grouted rock bolts are the most commonly used ground reinforcement method. A series of analytical solutions [2, 3, 4] have been made to study the load transfer mechanism in the rock bolting system. Farmer (1975) [5] presented an analytical model to predict the shear stress distribution of fully grouted rock bolts before decoupling occurs in the bolt grout interface. Li and Stillborg (1999) [6] proposed a model for describing the behavior of rock bolts by dividing the rock bolt into elastic, softening and de-bonding zones. Ren et al. (2010) and Blanco Martin et al. (2011) [2, 3] presented analytical models for fully grouted rock bolts based on a tri-linear bond-slip model. Ma et al. (2013) [4] introduced a non-linear bond-slip model to analytically simulate the behavior of fully grouted rock bolts. However, these analytical models have difficulty in representing the true interaction between rock bolts and the in situ rock mass as the solutions are based on simplified bolt-collar loading experiments. In this paper, a rock bolt element with both tension and shear restrictions is developed and implemented into the three dimensional FDM program. A series of pullout tests considering the end effect and bond-stiffness effect of the rock bolt are simulated by using the proposed rock bolt element. Thereafter, the effects of shear debonding are simulated by assuming two kinds of constitutive laws for the interface behavior. The debonding process at the nodes and the deformability of a rock bolt are also discussed in this paper.|","Document Type

When estimating the magnitude of horizontal stresses, elastic properties are often assumed constant over geologic time. In addition, the successive build-up of a formation and its burial history are often not considered despite playing an important role. In this paper, 2D finite element analysis is used to model the successive build-up of a formation with visco-elastic material that hardens with depth. Zero lateral strain and extensional lateral strain boundary conditions are explored. In all cases horizontal stresses are lower than vertical stress. Effective stress ratios are elevated in visco-elastic cases compared to elastic reference cases.
The ability of a visco-elastic material to dissipate deviatoric stresses may cause variations in effective stress ratios imposed by layers with different Poisson’s ratios to be much less pronounced than in corresponding linear elastic models. Extensional lateral strain boundary conditions lead to further reduced vertical to horizontal effective stress ratios because of reduced lateral confinement. These two mechanisms, viscous relaxation, which equalizes stress, and extensional lateral strain, which decreases horizontal stress, may operate simultaneously to determine the resulting magnitude of horizontal stress and of effective stress ratio. Depending on the stress regime, they may work in concert with or in opposition to each other. In the cases considered here, variations in horizontal stress magnitudes are smaller than predicted by linear elastic models, and thus hydraulic fractures may be less confined within low-stress intervals than customarily predicted.
1. INTRODUCTION
Estimates of horizontal stress magnitudes are often based on elastic properties under the assumption that present-day geometry and material properties are constant over time. In many cases, estimates of horizontal stress magnitudes do not completely agree with simple predictive theory. For a formation in a normal faulting environment in the Gulf of Mexico, in-situ effective stress data does not correlate with previously published fracture gradient models [1]. Instead, the effective stress ratio appears to be bound on the lower end by K=0.33, which corresponds to a Coulomb failure coefficient of µ=0.60, and on the higher end by K=1, which represents the isotropic stress limit. The differences likely result from a combination of effects such as a complicated burial history (e.g., [2]), time-dependent tectonic forces, pore pressure variations due to fluid migration, visco-plastic deformation (e.g., [3]), diagenesis and viscous relaxation (e.g., [4]).
As material is deposited in a sedimentary basin and subsequently buried, material parameters change with time or, equivalently, depth. In a simple deposition and burial scenario the most recent deposits, e.g. unconsolidated sands in an oceanic basin, can effectively dissipate differential stresses by viscous creep. As material subsides to greater depth and becomes increasingly compacted, it effectively hardens and loses the ability to deform viscously. This paper presents tests of how viscous relaxation and depth-dependent hardening during the formation of a sedimentary basin can influence resulting horizontal stress magnitudes.|","Document Type

Joints can significantly affect the mechanical behaviour of rock masses. The presence of a joint set is crucial to the initiation and propagation of caving. A numerical approach to cave assessment requires a realistic joint constitutive model, and therefore produces better prediction of the cavability of the orebody. An asperity degradation model for rock joints has been developed that considers the progressive abrasion of a true roughness area over joint sliding. The magnitude of dilatancy is predicted to be decreased exponentially with the increase in shear displacements. The degradation in dilation and post-peak strength along asperities is modelled on the basis of the wear process. Then, geometric conditions and rock strength are considered through the dimensional analysis. Experimental studies of direct shear tests have been conducted using triangular shaped asperities and the results are correlated with the model’s behaviour to demonstrate its performance. The proposed joint model can be readily implemented in numerical procedures such as discrete element method and used to simulate block or panel caving. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Block cave mining has drawn increasing attention in recent years because it permits the bulk extraction of low grade ore bodies in a cost effective manner. The cave propagation of a jointed rock mass is strongly governed by the frictional characteristics of the geological discontinuities and in particular, joints in rock. Therefore, explicit and accurate formulation towards the shear behaviour of joints avails prediction of rock mass caving.
Amongst many contributing factors, surface roughness plays a key role in the friction between joint walls. On one hand, roughness dilatancy serves as an important stabilizing effect. Two contacting bodies tend to separate during tangential movement due to the sliding of asperity surfaces of one body on the other. When the increase in contact surface volume is constrained, dilatancy augments normal stresses compressing joint walls, which in turn, can significantly increase a joint’s resistance. The asperity surfaces responsible for dilation, however, will degrade and affect the subsequent shear behaviour depending on the normal stress level and the mount of sliding.
Goldstein et al[1] and Patton [2] are among those who first attempted to predict the shear strength of non-planar rock joints based on the dilation caused by asperities. Thenceforth, the dilative feature of rock fractures has been addressed in both empirical and theoretical approaches by numerous researchers such as Ladanyi and Archambault [3], Barton [4], Schneider [5], Leichnitz [6], Plesha [7], Jing et al[8], Wibowo [9] and Oh et al[10].
The joint surfaces are irregular in nature; the roughness degree has been interpreted using statistical and fractal approaches [11-19]. As joint asperities degrade in shear, the surface damage has been investigated by several researchers based on the aforementioned methods including Gentier et al[20], Homand et al[21], Grasselli and Egger [22], Belem et al[23] and Jiang et al[24]. It seems that complete descriptions on asperity degradation are absent from those models because only geometric changes are taken into account. However, other factors such as normal stress magnitude and material strength are closely associated with the surface damage [25-28].
This paper presents a tribological relationship for joint asperity degradation based on the theory of wear. By dimensional analysis, factors affecting asperity deterioration including the applied stress and joint strength are taken into account. Examples are considered comparing the proposed model to experimental data.|","Document Type

Extraction of salt by leaching process is used intensively nowadays. This process extracts salt by dissolving the mineral with water. In this analysis about cavity dissolution modeling, we consider the case of a binary system, i.e., a chemical solute corresponding to the solid that is dissolved by a “solvent” (mainly water). Rock salt dissolution is controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface, i.e., equality of the chemical potentials. In this paper, a local non-equilibrium Diffuse Interface Model (DIM) and an explicit treatment of the brine-salt interface (using an ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) technique) are introduced in order to solve such dissolution problems. The control equations are obtained by upscaling micro-scale equations for a solid-liquid dissolution problem using a volume averaging theory. Based on this mathematical formulation, dissolution test cases are presented. We introduce and discuss the main features of the method. Illustrations of the interaction between natural convection and forced convection in dissolution problems are presented and the time and space evolution of the rock salt-fluid interface is shown through several examples.
1. INTRODUCTION
Dissolution of porous media or solids is widely concerned in many industrial fields, e.g., acid injection into petroleum reservoirs, dissolution of rocks caused by underground water, etc. In the latter, rock dissolution creates underground cavities of different shapes and sizes, which induces a potential risk of collapse as shown in Fig.1. In most applications, modeling such liquid/solid dissolution problems is of paramount importance.
Among all methods used for modeling dissolution process, we present two ways for simulating this problem. The first one is a direct treatment of the evolution of the fluid-solid interface, for instance using an ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) method [4]. The second uses a Diffuse Interface Model (DIM) to smooth the interface with continuous quantities [1, 3, 6 ], like the liquid phase volume fraction, species mass fractions, etc.
However, there are several difficulties associated with ALE method for the dissolution problem: in particular, the need for fine meshes near the dissolving interface can lead to severely deformed grid elements inducing numerical problems (instabilities, need for remeshing, etc.).|","Document Type

A laboratory testing program was developed to examine the short-term mechanical and time-dependent (creep) behavior of salt from the Bayou Choctaw Salt Dome. Core was tested under creep and quasi-static constant mean stress axisymmetric compression, and constant mean stress axisymmetric extension conditions. Creep tests were performed at 38 degrees Celsius, and the axisymmetric tests were performed at ambient temperatures (22-26 degrees Celsius). The testing performed indicates that the dilation criterion is pressure and stress state dependent. It was found that as the mean stress increases, the shear stress required to cause dilation increases. The results for this salt are reasonably consistent with those observed for other domal salts. Also it was observed that tests performed under extensile conditions required consistently lower shear stress to cause dilation for the same mean stress, which is consistent with other domal salts. Young’s modulus ranged from 27.2 to 58.7 GPa with an average of 44.4 GPa, with Poisson’s ratio ranging from 0.10 to 0.43 with an average of 0.30. Creep testing indicates that the BC salt is intermediate in creep resistance when compared with other bedded and domal salt steady-state behavior. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Sandia National Laboratories, on behalf of The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is evaluating the mechanical integrity of the salt pillars surrounding existing petroleum storage caverns in the Bayou Choctaw Dome (Louisiana) that are part of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The purpose of this experimental effort is to better characterize the salt strength, dilational strength and creep in the salt section above Cavern 102 and below the overlying abandoned caverns, where casing issues have been observed [1].
The core used for this experimental study was obtained from a drill hole from depths of 325 to 335 meters below ground surface (bgs) and is above one of the Bayou Choctaw SPR caverns. For reference the top of the salt dome lies between 183 and 213 meters bgs, and the total depth is over 3050 meters bgs. The natural rock salt deposits used in the SPR are ideal for storage of crude oil because of their low (nearly zero) permeability, ease of mining, and proximity to shipping and refining operations.
The mechanical behavior of rock salt is relatively unique when compared with other geologic media due to the well-known ability of salt to show significant time dependent deformation without fracturing when subjected to differential stresses [2]. This can result in the closure of caverns and mines over time, which results in reduced storage in the case of caverns. Under some differential stress states salt is known to dilate due to stress-induced microfracturing [3].
In this work elastic properties and dilation behavior were determined by performing constant mean stress axisymmetric compression (ASC) and axisymmetric extension (ASE) tests. Creep properties were determined using standard constant differential stress creep tests. While the composition of the salt used in this testing was not quantitatively determined, it was determined, from visual observation, that the salt is relatively pure halite with impurities comprising less than 2-4% by volume. Impurities appeared to be anhydrite. |","Document Type

F., GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences| Dresen, G., GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences","|Abstract
We deformed organic-samples from the Alum shale, Denmark, under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) using a deformation stage to observe the micromechanical deformation occurring during fracturing and creep deformation. In the first set of experiments, a disc-shaped sample was compressed to observe the formation of a mode I fracture as in a Brazilian disc test. In most cases, we were able to see the formation of a thin opening fracture before the macroscopic failure by a through-going fracture. Tensile strengths estimated from the mechanical data are in good agreement with those from normal-scale Brazilian disc tests. In another configuration, a rectangular sample was compressed under controlled loads in order to observe the elastic and creep deformation of the shale samples. Digital image correlation (DIC) analysis using the acquired microscope images show that elastic deformation within the rock is spatially heterogeneous as expected, but also the creep deformation occurs in a heterogeneous manner. Organic materials in the shale appear to be relatively compliant compared to other mineral components for both elastic and ductile deformation. While difficulties exist in capturing images during the deformation processes, these attempts give additional insights to the micromechanical processes governing the brittle and ductile deformation of shales. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Revealing the micromechanical processes that occur during rock deformation can help understand the macroscopic mechanical behavior observed during rock mechanics experiment and its controls. In brittle fracturing, observations of the gradual coalescence of acoustic micro-fractures revealed the gradual damage accumulation prior to rock failure and lead to damage rheology models which can quantify the gradual loss of stiffness as rocks approach failure [1, 2]. It is also common in ductile deformation of rocks that certain relatively weak phases in the rock dictate the overall strength of a rock as evidenced by strain localization features observed frequently in geological samples [3].
In this study, we investigate the possibility of visually observing the micromechanical deformation process by conducting in-situ deformation experiments under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and applying digital image correlation (DIC) analysis to the acquired digital images. DIC has been applied to rock mechanics studies primarily utilizing optical images [4-6] but still rarely with SEM images due to technical challenges [7]. Utilization of SEM images has the advantage of greatly enhancing the magnification while challenges lie in the longer image acquisition times and image instability compared to optical images.
We apply this technique to characterize the micromechanical deformation of organic-rich shales. Shales are characterized by a fine heterogeneous fabric which makes it difficult to observe deformation structures by simply comparing microscope images of pre- and post-deformed samples. Moreover, shales are clay-rich poly-mineralic rocks suggestive of complicated rheological behaviors. Laboratory studies have shown the mixed brittle-ductile behavior of these rocks even at unsaturated room temperature conditions suggested to be mainly dependent on the amount of clay and organic contents [8, 9]. However, much remains unclear including the exact physical mechanism responsible for these deformational behaviors. Thus a direct observation identifying the mineral constituent responsible for the overall behavior would enhance our understanding and capability to predict the long-term rheological behavior of these rocks. Such insights are of great importance for engineering purposes as ductile shale behavior is related to the stress variations observed in shale gas reservoirs [10] and shales are considered as potential sites for nuclear waste disposals [11].|","Document Type

The objective of this work is to model the influence of shear stresses induced by viscous fluid flow on wellbore spalling. We simulated a drop of stress and pore pressure at the wall of a meter-scale borehole with a plane strain Finite Element model. The rock mass was modeled as a jointed continuum. Block sliding was predicted from the tangential displacements in the joint after the shear failure criterion was reached. Simulations show that: (1) Higher far field stresses induce more normal stress in the joints, which prevents the occurrence of shear plastic strains in the joints and reduces block sliding at the wall; (2) Shear stresses and consequent shear plastic strains that are induced by viscous fluid flow in the joints are higher for higher fluid viscosities, and decrease over time as the blocks on each side of the joint slide on each other; (3) In joints that are in contact with the borehole, a change of one order of magnitude in the fluid viscosity results in a change in joint shear stress by a factor of 2. Results suggest that if drainage had been simulated over a longer period of time or for a smaller borehole diameter, the failure criterion would have been reached on a larger zone around the borehole, which could have a critical impact on the risk of borehole spalling. The numerical approach proposed in this work is expected to be useful to recommend wellbore operation modes so as to avoid excessive spalling and clogging.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fractures existing prior to, or induced by drilling play a determinant role in spalling and block detachment during the stages of fluid injection and withdrawal in quasibrittle rocks (e.g., shale). Both numerical simulation and in situ investigation have proved that the mechanical instability resulting in block detachment is affected by the orientation of fractures in reference to the principal direction of in situ stress [1, 2] and to the borehole axis [3, 4]. The fluid pressure difference induced by fluid flow around the borehole - especially in the fractures - also plays a primary role on the stability of blocks [5, 6]. As a matter of fact, the fluid present in the fractures applies a normal force on blocks faces, which disturbs the mechanical equilibrium of these blocks. In addition, viscous fluid flow generates shear stresses on fracture and block faces, which can also affect the mechanical stability of the blocks. To our best knowledge, these shear effects have not been estimated or taken into account in previous studies. The objective of this work is to model the influence of shear stresses induced by viscous fluid flow on wellbore spalling. We model the rock mass as a jointed continuum, in plane strain, with POROFIS Finite Element program [7]. Constitutive laws used for the bulk and joint materials are explained in Section 2. Joint elements are assigned a plastic model coupled to a failure criterion, which allows predicting the relative displacements of the blocks. We simulate a pore pressure drop at the borehole wall. Parametric studies on the ratio far field stress to initial pore pressure and on fluid viscosity are presented in Section 3. Conclusions on the risks of borehole spalling are drawn in Section 4.|","Document Type

The fracture propagation simulation is extensively studied analytically and numerically since the hydraulic fracturing is widely used for the exploitation of unconventional reservoir resources. Especially, the fracture propagation in natural fractured reservoirs often behaves twist and curved trajectories, so the fracture orientation and propagation path determination need more computational work in fracture tip stress field analysis in current finite element models. This paper describes a new finite element approach solving hydraulic fracture propagation by triangular gird split method (TMSM). This approach uses interaction integral to compute the mix-mode (opening and sliding modes) stress intensity factors, and the vector cross-product is applied on the split element position. The arbitrary fracture propagation angle is obtained through the maximum tangential stress criterion. Thus, the fracture dynamic propagation simulation can be achieved by the local unit of the fracture tip through mesh split or node movement. Because the fracture can grow along the mesh boundary or split one element, so this approach allows the fracture propagation path without the initial pre-determined meshes control. In the cases of classical fracture propagation and fracture interference analysis between adjacent fractures, the efficiency and accuracy of this approach was validated comparing the existing mesh reconstruction method. The results show that this approach can simulate fracture growth exactly at more complex stress circumstances with the advantage of no singular element construction and local mesh refinement at fracture tips. The relative computational efficiency makes this approach can be applied for better description of fracture propagation problems in complex naturally fractured reservoirs.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a widely applied engineering technology. It plays an important role in many fields, such as petroleum stimulation, rock burst prevention, in-situ stress measurement and geothermal development et al. Especially, with the development of shale gas reservoirs, the novel concept of SRV (Stimulated Reservoir Volume) has been put forward, which aims to form a complex fracture network rather than single elliptical fracture [1, 2]. Thus, the hydraulic fracture design not only describes hydraulic fracture propagation accurately but also should be computationally efficient for engineering. However, the fracture propagation mechanical law and the intercoupling mechanisms between fracturing fluid and rock matrix in hydraulic fracturing treatment under complicated geological conditions remains a research challenge in current technology [3,4,5].|","Document Type

Rock behaviour frequently does not fit the classical theory of continuum mechanics because of rock aggregated granular structure. Particularly, rock fracturing may be accompanied by zonal disintegration formation. The key to building the nonclassic model of rock fracturing is the granulated structure. Deformations of solid bodies with microscopic flaws can be described within the scope of non-Euclidean geometry, and non-trivial deformation incompatibility can be referred to as a fracture parameter. The new continuum model presented in this paper enables the prediction of the zones initializing and developing as a periodic structure. The non–Euclidean description of phenomenon initiates an appearance of two new material constants. The coupled model must comprise the fourth–order parabolic equation on disintegration thermodynamic parameter be solved with the classical hyperbolic system of equations for the dynamics of continuous media. The 2D model of formation of disintegration zone was solved numerically. The zone magnitude and site that can be described by the term ‘disintegration scale’ are determined by values of new constants. Therefore, the numerical model based on the new non-Euclidean continuum model is capable of predicting formation of a disintegration field periodic structure.
1. INTRODUCTION
Zonal disintegration in the mining industry began in the 1980s. The first observation of the phenomena in South Africa was made by Adams and Jager [1] at 1980. Later, Shemyakin et al. [2, 3, 4] observed and described the same phenomena. Glushikhin et al. [5] described a model experiment in a lab that reproduced the in–situ phenomena.
The periodic changes of the fractured zone cannot be clearly explained by classic approaches of solid mechanics. The linear theory of elasticity enables the stresses for cylindrical excavation to be calculated. Any of stress tensor components is a monotone function on an excavation boundary offset that provides the only possible fractured zone if certain rock-failure criteria is applied. To achieve the observed periodic structure using a classic approach, some redundant factors like the presence of specific hydrostatic pressure field must be available.|","Document Type

A subsidence simulation system using displacement measurement techniques based on opto-electronic displacement measurement sensors has recently been developed, introduced for subsidence engineering education purpose. The results of subsidence analysis define subsidence parameters including angle draws, angle of break, subsidence factors, etc. Subsidence profiles are determined in mathematical forms. The outcomes is useful in helping understand field subsidence mechanism and simulations and enhance the teaching of subsidence concepts such as angle of draw, angle of break and subsidence factors to undergraduate student class. The developed subsidence modeling device also helps reinforce lateral stress pressure and soil shear strength estimation from the subsidence modeling.
1. INTRODUCTION
Subsidence damages surface and subsurface structures such as foundations, utility lines, infrastructures, ground water regimes, etc. Subsidence is not a far and away issue only in other States, it also happens in Indiana. As shown in the Fig. 1, some southwestern counties of Indiana have some subsidence concerns [1]. In order to avoid or reduce subsidence damages, it is imperative to know the subsidence characteristics of the particular site, and proper design work has to be performed to prevent or minimize subsidence hazards.
There are two types of subsidence [2]: 1) pit, also called sinkhole or pot hole, and 2) trough or sag. Pit subsidence is characterized by an abrupt sinking of the surface, resulting in circular steep sided, crater-like features. Trough subsidence is a gentle, gradual depression of the surface. Subsidence is controlled by many factors, including width of unsupported cavity, height of cavity, thickness of overburden, strength and fracture system of rock, hydrology, and time [1, 2, 3]. 
In engineering geology class, undergraduate students are exposed to concepts the subsidence geohazards. To help them to visualize and understand the fundamental subsidence concepts and thus better prepared to minimize or prevent subsidence damage, it is necessary to understand subsidence phenomena. It is difficult to simulate or predict real subsidence development because of the complexity in physical characteristics such as rock failure and yield behavior, dimensional variations and time dependent behavior. |","Document Type

Over the past decade, shale oil becomes an important source of oil across the North America. Bakken Shale, one of the largest shale oil plays in the word, is producing about one million barrel oil per day. The main methods exploiting Bakken oil are drilling horizontal wells with multi-fracturing technology. Unfortunately, the oil rate declines rapidly from the initial high production. This decline is in part due to the deterioration of permeability resulting from the depletion of reservoir. Engineers and geoscientists cannot evaluate the relationship between permeability and pore pressure confidently without a permeability-pore pressure correlation developed from experimental data, although it is in general known that permeability declines as pore pressure is reduced. In this study, a large database was provided after the permeability were measured at different confining and pore pressure conditions for more than forty Bakken core samples. The significance of this study are: (1) measured data can be incorporated into reservoir model to simulate the reservoir performance to accurately forecast production from Bakken; (2) provided a correlation to calculate permeability as a function of pore pressure; (3) served as a guidance in analyzing other shale gas and oil plays whose reservoir characteristics are similar to Bakken formation.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Bakken Formation is a large unconventional reservoir in the Williston Basin, and covers parts of Montana, North Dakota, and Saskatchewan. The late Devonian to early Mississippian Bakken Formation consists of three members, the lower, middle, and upper. The upper and lower members are organic-rich shale, and the middle member contains sandstone, limestone, and dolostone [1].
Even though approximately 200 to 400 billion barrels of oil were generated [1] in Bakken Formation, the main method to exploit Bakken oil is drilling horizontal wells with multi-fracturing technology due to low permeability of Bakken Formation. However, the oil rate declines rapidly from the initial high production. This decline is in part due to the deterioration of permeability resulting from the depletion of reservoir [2]. Knowledge of the effect of pore pressure on the permeability of Bakken Formation is necessary in producing the hydrocarbon from Bakken shale.|","Document Type

Advances in complex fracture modeling have provided multiple realizations of the development of fracture networks in unconventional reservoirs. This has allowed for calibrated fracture network geometry definition in reservoirs that are conducive to fracture network growth in multiple directions as a result of the presence of natural fractures and low horizontal stress anisotropy. The ability to predict fracture network creation has allowed for fracturing design that focuses on net pressure development to achieve the desired complexity. Increases in fracture complexity can result in increased production results in low permeability unconventional reservoirs with two-phase hydrocarbon production. While this capability has led to positive results, there is a desire within the unconventional arena to increase the collaborative development of assets for even greater improvement and increased understanding of optimized exploitation of these assets. For this reason, the ability to include the realizations of complex fracture networks in a three-dimensional (3D) asset description would prove invaluable to asset development and well planning and further increase understanding across various disciplines. The need to incorporate results of complex fracture modeling and geomechanical descriptions within an earth model led to the development of an analysis process combining the results of multi-disciplinary modeling techniques focused on unconventional assets.
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Complex Fracture Modeling CapabilitiesWith advances in hydraulic fracture modeling aimed at describing the fracture development in unconventional plays, the ability to describe “non-typical” fracture network growth has improved significantly [3]. With this type of modeling, it is possible to observe fracture network patterns that include hydraulically induced fractures, which are induced and propagated in the direction of the maximum horizontal stress, as has been understood for some time. Additionally, fracture network growth that can be leakoff induced or stress induced and includes the development of fractures oblique to the maximum horizontal stress is now possible. Understanding fracture network growth and these patterns is becoming more important in unconventional plays having a geological setting conducive to this behavior, which often results in fracture networks that are much more complex than a simple bi-wing fracture. This modeling tool’s ability to map and describe these types of fracture networks allows for better completions optimization and the development of workflows that collaborate across geoscience and engineering disciplines to help maximize asset value.|","Document Type

Steeply dipping fractures and horizontally oriented stylolites occur in carbonate reservoirs and lead to the formation of orthogonal fracture networks. Interpretation of elastic waves propagated through orthogonal fracture networks is complicated because of the potential existence of guided modes along and between fractures, multiple internal reflections, as well as scattering from fracture intersections. The existence of some or all of these potentially overlapping modes depends on the local stress field that can preferentially close or open either one or both sets of fractures. For this study, an acoustic wavefront imaging system was used to examine the effect of bi-axial loading conditions on acoustic wave propagation in isotropic media with two orthogonal fracture sets. From the experimental data, guided wave behavior was affected by fracture spacing and fracture specific stiffnesses. The fracture stiffness differed among the fractures in the two sets and also differed from the stiffness of the intersections. Interpretation of the properties of fractures or fracture sets must consider the existence of non-uniform fracture stiffness within and among fracture sets, as well as consider the effect of fracture intersections. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Natural fractures are ubiquitous and play key roles in ground-water hydrology [1-3], construction of subsurface facilities [4], hydrocarbon resources exploration and production [5-8], earthquake precaution [9, 10] and nuclear waste sequestration [11]. In carbonate reservoirs, steeply dipping fractures are the most common type that are a result of imbalanced vertical and horizontal stresses [12]. On the other hand, horizontally-oriented or strike-perpendicular fracture/joints are also frequently observed [12, 13]. The major causes of the formation of strike-perpendicular fracture/joints are either pressure dissolution of mineral material in rocks (which forms horizontally-oriented stylolites [14, 15]) or stress rotation mechanisms [16] that results in orthogonal cross-joints in many geological sites. |","Document Type

Fracture-permeability relations of shale are needed in hydraulic fracturing, CO2 sequestration, and nuclear waste disposal. In this study, we use triaxial coreflood experiments in combination with x-ray tomography to study fracture generation and permeability during injection of water. The experiments were conducted on Utica shale at temperatures from 25-50 °C and confining pressures from 3.4 to 13.8 MPa. Fractures were generated using direct shear methods with semi-circular anvils. Permeability was monitored following fracture events as a function of continuing deformation and hydrostatic pressure. Fractures propagating parallel to bedding were an order of magnitude more transmissive than fractures propagating perpendicular to layers. Maximum whole rock permeability ranged from 70-900 mD. Shale strength when fractures propagated parallel to bedding was a linear function of the angle between the fracture and the direct-shear plane and was Strength (MPa) = 0.8034 x Angle (°) + 26.259. This behavior appeared to be related to the amount of shear-plane deformation accommodated by bedding planes. Permeability was not a clear function of this angle but peaked sharply for fractures that crossed bedding planes at angle near 45°.

In hydraulic fracturing, the goal is to produce hydrocarbon by generating (or reactivating) pervasive, permeable fracture systems. In CO2 sequestration, risk assessment studies must consider the possibility that pressurization of the storage reservoir could induce fractures in caprock (which may be shale) where the consequences are governed by the permeability of the damage zone. In nuclear waste disposal located in shale formations, risk assessment studies must consider the permeability of potential flow paths generated during excavation of the repository, within pre-existing fracture networks, and within any subsequent fracture events induced by seismicity.|","Document Type

This paper presents the results of numerical modeling through finite element method and discrete element method for single cutter drilling in carbonate samples. This work is relevant to understand the mechanics of drill bit – rock interaction while drilling deep wells and the results behavior were validated with experimental data raised under simulated downhole conditions. Triaxial confining tests were carried out in cylindrical samples of the same carbonate rock used in the cutting experiments. The results were used to create a virtual rock to be utilized by both the discrete and finite element methods. The numerical models were carried out under different geometrical configurations, varying the cutter chamfer size and back-rake angles. The forces generated on the cutter are translated into mechanical specific energy, MSE as this parameter is often used to measure drilling efficiency. Results indicate that the chamfer size does not change significantly the MSE values, although the cutter aggressiveness is influenced by this geometrical characteristic. Results also show there is a significant increase in drilling resistance for larger values of back-rake angle.
1. INTRODUCTION
The drilling optimization depends on a detailed evaluation process of the cutter behavior during the rock cutting. Through single cutter tests, the effects of geometrical variations in the cutter can be evaluated from the point of view of forces and energy. The possibility of assessing these phenomena numerically, through triaxial calibrations of complex models, significantly expands the spectrum of rock drilling optimization process. 
The mechanical interaction among the numerical sample and the cutter is evaluated in terms of mechanical specific energy (MSE) and aggressiveness. MSE is a parameter commonly used to measure cutting efficiency and can be defined as the work done per unit volume excavated, according to Teale (1965). The aggressiveness, in a single cutter scenario, can be defined as the slope of the cutting force to normal force (Akbari et al., 2014a) and, conventionally, the more aggressive the cutter, the higher the penetration rate achieved. In numerical modeling of single cutter test, keeping constant the depth of cut and the rate of penetration among simulations, the aggressiveness can be used as a sensitivity parameter in analyses regarding the cutting efficiency.|","Document Type

Seismicity induced by pore pressure increases poses a major hazard for many fluid injection operations, such as waste water injection, secondary recovery of hydrocarbons and CO2 storage. Diffusion of fluids outside of the target injection formation through relatively permeable faults may especially induce large seismic events, often below the reservoir in the crystalline basement. Understanding the mechanisms of seismic events induced under these circumstances is the key for hazard predictions and mitigation measures. In this study we model a simplified pressure diffusion scenario and use dynamic rupture modeling to study the nucleation and propagation of seismic events due to injection-induced pressure changes. In particular, we study the influence of the shape of the pressure diffusion profile on the dynamic characteristics of rupture. We find that high pressure gradients are more likely to cause smaller events, whereas low pressure gradients cause slip over a much larger portion of the fault, with a slightly higher slip rate. In addition, we analyze the influence of the background stress and the friction drop on the fault on the fault rupture. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Human-induced pore pressure increases in subsurface aquifers/reservoirs can cause fault reactivation, which is undesirable because (i) it may damage the sealing capacity of the caprock faults, which is of particular importance for the integrity of CO2 storage sites in the case of large-scale CO2 injection [1,2] and (ii) it may cause felt seismicity, which has posed an especially large problem in the US over the past decade in relationship to waste water injection [e.g. 3]. In this study we aim to gain better understanding on when to expect fault reactivation due to injection into porous aquifers/reservoirs, and in particular what controls the magnitude and dynamic characteristics of induced seismic events.
There are multiple mechanisms that can induce fault reactivation during fluid injection into porous aquifers: (i) fluid pressure changes in faults lower the normal effective stress, and bring faults closer to failure; (ii) fluid pressure induced volume changes cause poroelastic stressing of the aquifer and its surroundings; (iii) cooling and contraction of the rock which also stresses the surrounding; and (iv) mineral reactions that change fault shear strength. Here we focus on the pressure related effects, i.e. poro-elastic stress changes and direct pressure effects in faults. Seismicity observed in relationship to secondary recovery (i.e. a low pressure injection of water in a reservoir to stimulate oil production after primary production has declined) and in particular large scale waste water injection into permeable aquifers/reservoirs often takes place outside/underneath the target injection layer [4]. In case of basal aquifers (aquifers overlying the basement) seismicity often takes place in the crystalline basement. The inferred mechanism for this seismicity is fluid diffusion into the basement through relatively permeable faults [5]. If the basement is critically stressed, only small pore pressure perturbations may be enough to induce seismicity [6]. Understanding what controls the magnitude of these diffusion related events is the key for assessment of seismic hazard and the development of mitigation measures. |","Document Type

In recent years, salt cavern failures and sinkholes associated with brine wells in solution mining have created concerns and initiated more restrict regulations and guidelines for solution mining operations. One of the monitoring tools for cavern stability relates to tracking passive microseismic activity during brine well operation. Any gradual or sudden rockmass failure is often associated with pre-failure microfracturing activity in the rockmass which leads to microseismic activity. A suitably designed microseismic system with sufficient sensitivity can capture the pre-failure activity days or months before the failure and along with other instrumentation and geotechnical analysis can provide critical information that can be used to help identify and possibly reduce the risk of catastrophic rockmass failure. This paper presents two cases of induced microseismic monitoring in soft rock media and of salt caverns created by solution mining. An example of a microseismic system installation and calibration in a salt cavern is demonstrated, and the results of advanced analysis from a second salt cavern monitoring are briefly investigated.
1. INTRODUCTION
Microseismic systems were initially developed for applications in underground hard rock mining due to increased microseismic activity initiated by higher mining depths and therefore higher stress levels. The increased seismic activity and violent rockbursts causing damage and fatalities led to more rapid development of this technology. The main purpose of early microseismic systems was to enhance safety in seismic active areas of the mine. The early systems were only able to provide approximate information on location and magnitude of seismic events.
Today, however, the high-end technology is capable of recording full waveforms on a continuous basis that can further be processed through advanced seismology codes and powerful computers for additional understanding of the rockmass behavior. The systematic mechanism and source parameter analysis of seismic events can now be reliably used as a geotechnical tool to assess strain/stress changes in the monitored volume.|","Document Type

M., Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.,| Poiate Jr, E., Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.,| Amaral, C. S., Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.,| Pereira, A. M. B., Fluminense Federal University (UFF)","|Abstract
This paper discusses the design of underground salt caverns, opened by solution mining, for CO2 sequestration in Brazil, considering the large thicknesses and continuity of rock salt overlying the pre-salt reservoirs. Rock salt has negligible porosity when compared to other geomaterials, which ensures sealing to most fluids and gases. It is also subject to the phenomenon of visco-plastic creep deformation and can tolerate high levels of strain without developing structural damage of its mineral skeleton. Another phenomenon is the process of self-healing, where cracks and faults are self-healed with time. Taking advantage of these properties, caverns developed by solution mining in salt domes may be used for storage of hydrocarbons and other products, for example CO2. Special attention is given to the geomechanical structural design of the caverns using computer codes developed for the simulation of excavations in salt rock formations, considering validated constitutive creep laws obtained by lab tests. The codes have being used in the design of several clusters of caverns for brine production, design of the underground conventional potash mine and in the design of the pre-salt oil wells, for the exploration and production of the pre-salt reservoirs. Despite being a technology already dominated worldwide, the use of underground storage of CO2 in salt caverns for offshore application in deep and ultra-deep water is unprecedented.
1. INTRODUCTION
With the application of new technologies for processing and interpreting seismic data, PETROBRAS, in recent years, has achieved great success in the discovery of giant oil fields underlying thick layers of rock salt. The rock salt has negligible porosity when compared to other geomaterials, which ensures excellent sealing to most fluids and gases, even under high pressures. Rock salt is also subject to the phenomenon of visco-plastic creep deformation which develops in the time domain as the relaxation of the deviatoric or shear stresses, to the condition of steady-state equilibrium with constant creep strain rate and can tolerate high levels of strain without developing structural damage of its mineral skeleton. This phenomenon can be observed in nature in the sedimentary layers intercepted by salt domes or other structures associated with the natural movement of salt.|","Document Type

Detournay and Tan (2002) performed experiments with a rock cutting device to measure the load required to fail the rock under confining stress. They proposed models describing the correlation between the specific energy and confining stress for shear dilatant rocks as a function of unconfined specific energy at failure, cutter rake angle (<U+03B8>), internal friction angle (<U+03C6>) of the rock, and an assumed interface friction angle (<U+03C8>) between the rock and the cutter. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the model proposed by Detournay and Tan (2002). Their model assumes that the interfacial friction angle between the rock and the cutter is equal to the internal friction angle (<U+03C8>). Their model also assumes that the rate of change coefficient (m) is constant for different bore hole pressures (pm). To evaluate the model, data on three (3) rock formations (Mancos Shale, Pierre Shale, and Catoosa Shale) was used in the study. The data on Mancos shale and Pierre shale was obtained from Zijsling (1987) and data on Catoosa Shale was obtained from Smith (1998). Quantitative assessment of rate of change coefficient (m) of specific energy was also accomplished to evaluate the assumption that m is constant for different bore hole pressures. The results show that the interface friction angle varies with the bore hole pressure and is not equal to the internal friction angle. The results also show that rate of change coefficient (m) of specific energy estimated using the equation proposed by Detournay and Tan (2002) and an assumed internal friction is not representative of m obtained from known values of internal friction angle, interface friction angle, and back rake angle.
1. INTRODUCTION
Behavior of rock under a range of confining pressures has a vital role in its applications to many engineering and scientific disciplines. The strength and stress - strain behavior of rock under confining stress are particularly important to geophysicists analyzing plate tectonics, earthquakes, and other fault movements. They are also useful to engineers designing deep foundations for buildings, off shore structures, and dams on the rocks. It is significantly important for drilling engineers to understand the behavior of the rock under various confining stresses to understand the behavior of drill bits on different kinds of rocks and to develop techniques for enhanced rate of penetration (RoP). Confining pressures affect the unconfined strength of the rock and the energy required to cut a rock during drilling.|","Document Type

M., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory| Mason, H. E., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory| Carroll, S. A., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","|Abstract
In this study we used CO2 core-flood experimental data to develop and calibrate a three-dimensional continuum-scale reactive transport model for simulating CO2-induced rock porosity and permeability evolution. During the core flooding experiments the CO2-equilibrated brine was injected into carbonate rock samples, which were collected from the Arbuckle carbonate reservoir, Wellington, Kansas. We analyzed X-ray computed microtomography (XCMT) characterization data to examine heterogeneous distributions of pore structures, naturally occurring fractures, and mineral phases inside the cores, and then used them to constrain initial model macroscopic properties including porosity, permeability, and mineral compositions. Model chemical reaction kinetics, porosity-permeability, and porosity-surface area correlations were also calibrated with the experimental data. Our model results indicate that the calibrated continuum-scale reactive transport models are able to adequately predict the dissolution behavior of fractured carbonate rocks at a core scale. In addition the model calibration against core flood experiments provides a useful basis for upscaling reactive transport properties used to describe carbonate dissolution from the laboratory (core) scale to field (reservoir) scale.
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding the effect of rock-water interactions on rock porosity and permeability under CO2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) conditions is an active area of research [e.g. 1-9]. To this purpose, there is a need to develop reliable reactive transport models, which can accurately represent essential features of CO2-fluid-rock interactions at laboratory and field scales. This is challenging, because adaptation of pore scale models needed to describe fluid-mineral geochemical interactions is limited in scale by their high computational cost. For this reason a macro-scale continuum model based on Darcy flow approximations is often used to simulate reactive transport processes, and evaluate geochemical and transport impacts of rock-fluid interactions at large scales. An important challenge in modeling reactive transport and mineral chemical alteration processes, particularly in a heterogeneous and fractured rock system, is to constrain effective macroscopic parameters (e.g. porosity-permeability relationships, chemical rate kinetics, porosity-reactive-surface-area correlations) required by the continuum-scale models. Model predictions made in the absence of proper calibration or upscaling of these governing transport and reaction parameters are highly uncertain. A number of studies [e.g. 6-12] have suggested that the use of either pore-scale simulations or experimental data to calibrate the continuum-scale models could help reduce such uncertainty.|","Document Type

Using a coupled lattice Boltzmann and discrete element method, we have developed a new tool for the numerical characterisation of dense suspension rheology. This approach has been implemented using a shared memory, multicore, parallel architecture which allows for rapid and inexpensive evaluation of model results. Where model capabilities include non-Newtonian rheology, turbulence, fluid-solid interactions, and lubricated solid-solid interactions. Through consideration of the fundamental phenomena of flow and contact mechanics this model is able to accurately capture the suspension rheology.
Using this coupled framework we have implemented a numerical couette flow rheometer, discrete element particles are packed into a cubic lattice Boltzmann domain which is periodic in the lateral directions. Using either stress or shear rate control, this model then simulates the shearing of the particulate suspension. The resultant hydrodynamic and mechanical forces on the shearing plane are recovered once the model has achieved a steady state, where these results are used to compute an effective suspension viscosity. The results from this analysis have been validated against existing semi-empirical expressions. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Simulation of particle transport often occurs at a scale orders of magnitude larger than the size of the particulate inclusions. Where previous work in this field has focused on development of constitutive equations to describe the effective viscosity of suspensions with a specific solid volume fraction [1]. The rheology specified by such expressions is then typically used to calibrate a power-law based rheological model [2]. However, work by Lyon & Leal has shown that even in a relatively simple poiseuille flow the distribution of solid particulates is not uniform across the aperture [3]. This spatially varying solid volume fraction shows the need to directly simulate both the fluid and particles in order for correct flow behaviour to be accurately represented.|","Document Type

C., Imperial College London","|Abstract
A three-dimensional fracture model developed in the context of the combined finite-discrete element method is incorporated into a two-way fluid-solid coupling model. The fracture model is capable of simulating the whole fracturing process. It includes pre-peak hardening deformation, post-peak strain softening, transition from continuum to discontinuum, and the explicit interaction between discrete fracture surfaces, for both tensile and shear fracture initiation and propagation. The fluid-solid coupling model can simulate the interactions between moving fluids and multi-body solids. By incorporating the fracture model into the coupling model, a methodology of using the new coupling model to capture fracturing behaviour of solids in fluid-solid coupling simulations is proposed. To solve the problem in the coupling model of having adaptive continuous meshes being used by the fluid code and discontinuous meshes in the solid code, a scheme to convert different meshes is developed. A single fracture propagation driven by fluid pressures is simulated and the results show that the modelling obtains the correct critical load and propagation direction for fluid-driven fracturing. Several important phenomena, such as stress concentration ahead of the fracture tip, adaptive refinement of fluid mesh as a response to the fracture propagation and fluids flowing into fractures, are properly captured.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing has been used in the oil and gas industry for more than half a century. It is particularly important for the extraction from unconventional reservoirs, which otherwise would be considered as uneconomical. In the research field of hydraulic fracturing, an increasing amount of effort has been put into the development of novel numerical models to simulate realistic scenarios. However, the numerical modelling of hydraulic fractures still remains a challenge for computational mechanics because of the complexities in fluid-solid coupling, fracture characterisation, and particularly in three dimensions, the complicated geometry and topology update when fractures propagate. In recently years, many attempts have been made and significant progress achieved in three-dimensional hydraulic fracturing simulations. Carter et al. (2000) [1] proposed a fully threedimensional hydraulic fracture model, but they neglected the fluid continuity equation in the area around the fracture. Secchi and Schrefler (2012) [2] developed a method to simulate three-dimensional hydraulic fractures in porous media and presented an example of a concrete dam. In this paper, a three-dimensional fracture model is incorporated into a two-way fluid-solid coupling model for hydraulic fracture simulations. The three-dimensional fracture model is capable of simulating the whole fracturing process. It includes prepeak hardening deformation, post-peak strain softening, transition from continuum to discontinuum, and the explicit interaction between discrete fracture surfaces, for both tensile and shear fracture initiation and propagation. After incorporating it into the fluid-solid coupling model, where the interaction between fluids and solids can be explicitly simulated, the initiation and propagation of fractures can be driven by forces generated both from solids loading and transferred from fluids loading, e.g. fluid pressure, which significantly extends the application of this fracture model into some very important areas that would not be possible with only solids modelling, e.g. the simulation of hydraulic fractures.|","Document Type

A bored 13.4 m diameter highway tunnel being constructed across the Istanbul Strait in Istanbul, Turkey under a maximum 12 bars of water pressure required a deep excavation on the Asian side of the waterway for launching the tunnel boring machine and initiating NATM tunnels on the opposite end of the excavation. The excavation is up to 38.2 m deep and 173.7 m long in very poor quality sedimentary rock consisting of siltstone/mudstone and sandstone. The selection of design rock parameters considered not only data from site explorations, but previous excavation experience in Istanbul. During initial excavation stages, unexpectedly high lateral movements of the anchored support walls were measured. Using the monitoring data, a back-analysis of the excavation support system was performed to determine revised design rock parameters. The support system was modified by adding additional levels of anchors, and the excavation was successfully completed December 2013.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Eurasia Tunnel Project is part of a new 14.6-km road link between Kazlicesme on the European side of the Istanbul Strait and Goztepe on the Asian side (Figure 1). The project helps address Istanbul's increasing traffic problems and greatly reduces the travel time across the Istanbul Strait by avoiding the need to use either a ferry or one of the city’s perimeter bridges. The project includes a 3.4-km two-deck tunnel beneath the seabed at the southern end of the Istanbul Strait (also known as the Bosphorus) constructed with a tunnel boring machine (TBM), 2 km of NATM tunnels, and 1 km of cut-andcover tunnel structures. The project also provides roadway improvements for the approaches to the tunnel. The tunnel is designed for passenger vehicles and small trucks with a limited vertical clearance of 3.0 m. The east and west bound roadways are stacked within the 13.2-m outside diameter tunnel. The Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications formulated the project technical specifications. Figure 2 presents a general plan and profile for the Eurasia Tunnel Project. The various underground elements of the project are described by Clark et al. (2015).|","Document Type

Geological structures in the subsurface ranging from fractures to reservoirs can be simplified as ellipsoidal inhomogeneities. For instance, one can model a reservoir as an inclusion by considering possibly different material properties and different fluid pressure in comparison to the surrounding rock. Hence, the stresses and displacements associated with the fluid withdrawal from or fluid injection into the formations can be determined by assuming no hydraulic communication between the inclusion and the surrounding medium. The lack of hydraulic communication could be the result of a cap rock or an impermeable seal/fault. On other hand, in the case of fractures, this assumption in not valid anymore and the hydraulic communication between the inclusion and medium should be considered in the calculations. This paper provides analytical solutions for deformation and stress distribution inside and outside of poroelastic ellipsoidal inclusions. Eshelby theory with the Biot theory of poroelasticity are combined to model the change in stress caused by changes in pore pressure or temperature inside the inclusions. Using the provided analytical solutions, we explore the effect of inclusion size, material properties and pressure/temperature condition. The results confirm that neglecting hydraulic communication between the inclusion and the sounding matrix may result in lower inclusion volume change ratio associated with mode (1) and higher inclusion volume change ratio associated with mode (2). 
1. INTRODUCTION
Despite considerable advances in numerical modeling of subsurface engineering problems, there is still a need for analytical solutions as a benchmark for numerical models as well as a quick resort to approximate solutions. Due to the nature of numerical techniques, boundary effects and discretization error may easily occur in any basic modelling efforts. Eshelby’s equivalent inclusion theory is recognized as one of the most powerful techniques for deriving analytical solutions for many elasticity problems, however, this techniques has not yet widely utilized for poroelastic problems. Presence of pore fluid in the porous materials and its coupling with material deformations leads to different class of material behaviors known as poroelastic behavior. |","Document Type

Rib-failure related accidents in underground coal mines continue to cause injuries and fatalities. Investigation of the coal-mass failure process through numerical simulation is one approach to mitigate rib failures. 
The paper presents a framework to describe the strength and deformation of a coal-mass. The peak strength is evaluated by the Hoek-Brown failure criterion. The residual stiffness and strength are evaluated by the Fang and Harrison degradation model. The dilation is defined by the Alejano and Alonso peak-dilation model. 
Using laboratory and in-situ coal numerical models, regression equations were developed to scale-down the strength and degradation parameters of coal material. Through a try-and-error process, the appropriate parameters of coal-mass could be defined by matching the behavior of modeled rib to field observations. If such observations are not available, preliminary parameters of coal-mass are calculated for a specimen size of 1.5 m. Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio are 3.0 GPa and 0.25, respectively. The Hoek-Brown peak strength parameters “m”, “s,” and “a” of the coal-mass are 1.659, 0.015, and 0.5, respectively. The unconfined peak and residual strengths of the coal-mass are 4.3 and 0.35 MPa, respectively. The degradation parameter and the critical plastic shear strain of coal-mass are 0.485 and 0.2, respectively. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Potential rib instabilities, such as brow formation, toppling, bumps, etc. are threats in underground coal mines. Efforts to improve the stability of underground mine ribs have continued for decades. Despite the ongoing rib-support-related research, there has been a continual occurrence of rib-related fatalities in underground coal mines. While these efforts have contributed to the overall improvement in rib safety, the average fatality rate is still 1.3 fatalities per year over the last 18 years [1]. Because of the wide variation in requirements and design criteria nor a universal methodology for rib support, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is conducting research towards developing guidelines for determining the appropriate level of support and design methods for support systems to minimize the risk and severity of injuries to miners from rib falls in underground coal mines.|","Document Type

Determining mechanical properties of reservoir rocks through mechanical testing is a well-established procedure. Static properties obtained from these tests (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, UCS, etc.) are fundamental to calibrate both 1D geomechanical models (well-scale) and complex 3D models (reservoir-scale). These mechanical lab tests have the disadvantage of being destructive, making it impossible to obtain large amounts of data and limiting the generation of geomechanical reservoir models. In this context, numerical simulations of laboratory tests can be a good alternative to obtain mechanical properties of rock without the expensive destructive testing. 
In this paper, we present a methodology based on numerical simulations and image analysis (thin sections and/or micrographs of cores) to model the mechanical properties from Brazilian tests simulations. The developed methodology reproduces in the simulator the mineralogy, the texture and the structure of the rock to improve the understanding of the distribution of the mechanical properties of the formations. The results are in good agreement with mechanical lab tests. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In the last few decades, unconventional reservoirs have been intensively developed after proving its economic feasibility. Among them, tight sands and shale formations have been exploited. 
Those reservoirs have the characteristic of having very low matrix permeability (well below 1mD), and need to be massively fractured to generate high conductivity channels, to connect preexisting fractures to the well and/or facilitate hydrocarbon flow from the rock matrix. 
The performance of those wells depends on the quality of the intended hydraulic fracture, which behavior is strongly affected by the mechanical properties of the rock. For that reason, traditional mechanical tests, such as the Brazilian, tri-axial, etc., have become standard in the oil and gas industry, to characterize reservoir rocks mechanical properties [1]. |","Document Type

A method is presented to qualify the maximum horizontal stress direction on basis of dipole shear sonic anisotropy in near-vertical wellbores. The proposed scheme follows a similar qualification standard to that used for stress observations on the basis of image logs and four-arm caliper logs in the World Stress Map Project. Image log analysis and shear wave anisotropy analysis will often complement one another and add confidence when both are observed. The combination of geological setting and rock properties, together with drilling practices, does not always result in clear borehole failure, limiting the ability to quantify stress direction from images alone. Shear sonic anisotropy is often able to identify horizontal stress imbalance where borehole failure has yet not occurred. Herein, we review the methodology to determine stress direction on the basis of dipole borehole sonic data, including examination of the effect of hole ovality. The use of slowness frequency dispersion curves is particularly important, as dispersion curve analysis is essential for distinguishing shear sonic anisotropy due to horizontal differential stresses from that caused by lithological fabric and natural fractures.
1. INTRODUCTION
Borehole dipole (flexural) sonic waves provide the opportunity to identify and quantify shear anisotropy. The dipole flexural waves polarize into a fast and slow shear in the presence of elastic anisotropy in the planes containing the borehole axis. Anisotropy may be the result of mechanical anisotropy, fractures, or stress. Slowness-dispersion analysis provides the ability to identify stress-induced azimuthal anisotropy. If anisotropy is confirmed to be a result of a differential stress, one can then determine the direction of maximum horizontal stress from the direction of the fast shear wave in a near-vertical wellbore [1, 2, 3, 4]. This technique is commonly used in the petroleum industry for complementing other methods, such as borehole failure measured from calipers and images, to deduce the direction and magnitude of the present-day horizontal stresses. Stress characterization methods that rely on the presence of borehole failure using images are limited to boreholes that exhibit failure. Similarly there are situations where high differential stresses are observed from borehole failure and yet shear wave anisotropy is absent. Theory and laboratory testing illustrate that all rocks have some degree of acoustic sensitivity to changes in stress, which is related to the compliance of the grain-to-grain contacts. In the borehole, this phenomenon is also limited by the accuracy of acoustic logging technology [30]. These data are then used for future geomechanics-related studies for predicting sand production, planning stimulation treatments, reservoir engineering, and wellbore stability [6, 7, and 8].|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Micromodels have proven to be effective tools for quantifying flow and transport phenomena in complex porous media [1, 2]. The vast majority of micromodels consist of idealized, thin porous structures etched into engineered materials (e.g., glass, plastic, silicon) in which flow and transport is restricted to two-dimensions [1]. Combined with advanced imaging techniques, microfluidic investigations provide real-time, pore-scale quantification of fluid, interfacial, and mass transfer dynamics - information that is otherwise largely inaccessible in other experimental systems. 
Microfluidic flow investigations have the potential to play a large role in future energy resource technologies, especially those related to fossil fuels [3]. Operations associated with fossil fuel production are largely considered reservoir-scale problems, ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers. However, the fluid flow and transport processes of interest occur within the pores and fractures of rock that are nanometers to millimeters in size, making microfluidics an ideal method for identifying key flow physics that accurately explain reservoir-scale observables. |","Document Type

A grain-based rock model was developed and applied to study wellbore stability. The rock is represented as an assembly of tetrahedral blocks with bonded contacts. Material heterogeneity is modeled by varying the tensile strength at the block contacts. This grain-based rock model differs from previous disk/sphere particle-based rock models (e.g., Potyondy and Cundall, [1]) in its ability to represent a zero (or very low) initial porosity condition, as well as highly interlocked irregular block shapes that provide resistance to movement even after contact breakage. As a result, this model can reach higher uniaxial compressive strength to tensile strength ratios and larger friction coefficients than the disk/sphere particle-based rock model. 
The model was first used to match the properties of typical rocks (such as sandstone) by simulating the direct tension test and uniaxial compression test. The calibrated model was then applied to study wellbore breakout and the thick-walled cylinder (TWC) test. The model captured the fragmentation process near the wellbore due to buckling and spalling. Thin fragments of rock similar to onion skins were produced, as observed in laboratory breakout experiments (e.g., Haimson, [2]). The results suggest that this approach may be well-suited to study the rock disaggregation process and other geomechanical problems in the oil and gas industry.

Wellbore stability is required to recover oil and gas resources safely. Wellbores can fail via several mechanisms, including stress-related failures such as breakout and tensile failure, subsidence (depletion), fault activation due to production, and complex geologic conditions. 
Image logs have been used extensively (Barton and Zoback, [3]) to observe and investigate wellbore failures, and numerical modeling has been used for several decades to predict and simulate wellbore failures. The history of numerical methods for borehole stability has been presented by Salehi et al. [4]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several linear elastic and poroelastic models for borehole stability were introduced by Bradley [5], Detournay and Cheng [6], Fuh et al. [7], and Yew and Lui [8]. In the 1990s, nonlinear elastic, plastic and elasto-plastic models were developed by McLean and Addis [9], McLellan and Wang [10], and McLellan [11]. Several thermo- and chemo-poroelastic models were also developed by Li et al. [12], Wang and Dusseault [13] and others. Although more complex material behavior was modeled in the later models, all of the aforementioned models were two-dimensional. |","Document Type

J., Sandia National Laboratories| Lee, M. Y., Sandia National Laboratories| Gardner, W. P., Sandia National Laboratories","|Abstract
A helium leakage detection system was modified to measure gas permeability on extracted cores of nearly impermeable rock. Here we use a Helium - Mass - Spectrometry - Permeameter (HMSP) to conduct a constant pressure, steady state flow test through a sample using helium gas. Under triaxial stress conditions, the HMSP can measure flow and estimate permeability of rocks and geomaterials down to the nanodarcy scale (10-21m2). In this study, measurements of flow through eight shale samples under hydrostatic conditions were in the range of 10-7to 10-9Darcy. We extend this flow measurement technology by dynamically monitoring the release of helium from a helium saturated shale sample during a triaxial deformation experiment. The helium flow, initially extremely low, consistent with the low permeability of shale, is observed to increase in advance of volume strain increase during deformation of the shale. This is perhaps the result of microfracture development and flow path linkage through the microfractures within the shale. Once microfracturing coalescence initiates, there is a large increase in helium release and flow. This flow rate increase is likely the result of development of a macrofracture in the sample, a flow conduit, later confirmed by post-test observations of the deformed sample. The release rate (flow) peaks and then diminishes slightly during subsequent deformation; however the post deformation flow rate is considerably greater than that of undeformed shale.
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding fluid flow in shale and or mudstone may prove important if that rock were to be considered as an extensive seal in a CO2 storage scenario, as a top seal in an oil and gas reservoir, or similarly as the closure barrier in a compressed air energy storage reservoir. In the above “applications” the low shale permeability is relied upon to create a flow barrier. It is reasonable then to study the flow characteristics of shale at reservoir conditions, and conditions where geologic and manmade conditions may have prompted the rock to fracture. We are studying a different method to measure flow, and estimate shale permeability; we are also, as an extension of that method, determining helium release during shale deformation.|","Document Type

Pore pressure reduction due to hydrocarbon extraction from gas reservoirs causes compaction of the reservoir rock accompanied by a redistribution of stresses in the surrounding rock mass, leading to sub-surface deformations and surface subsidence. There is evidence to suggest that the induced sub-surface movements in some of the Netherlands’ gas fields (the motivation behind the study) are time-varying. The sandstone reservoirs in question are overlain by relatively thick layers of rocksalt, which flows viscoelastically when shear stress are applied to it. For this reason, rocksalt flow has been proposed as a mechanism to explain the observed time-dependence. The work reported here aims to understand the mechanisms by which viscoelastic rocksalt flow can cause surface displacements and to assess whether the magnitude of the resulting displacements can be significant over timescales similar to those observed in the field. Finite Element analyses of idealized reservoir geometries and simplified geological models will be employed for this purpose, with the aim of avoiding complexities that can mask the underlying processes and phenomena. Results here indicate that salt-driven flow has the potential of inducing significant timedependent subsidence, in excess to the ones calculated through solely elastic analyses of the same problem. They therefore indicate that in cases where accurate subsidence predictions are essential, salt has to be modeled accurately. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Extraction of natural gas from a reservoir rock formation leads to pore-fluid pressure decrease and so an effective stress increase in the reservoir rock. This in turn leads to reservoir compaction which is registered at the surface as subsidence. The link between production-induced pore pressure changes at the reservoir level and surface subsidence is well-established, e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4].
In many cases the ground is modelled as elastic and so an immediate subsidence response to the pore pressure reduction is expected at the surface (after [5, 6]). This thinking therefore assumes that subsidence stops immediately after the stop of production from a reservoir. However there is growing evidence to suggest that for some reservoirs there is a delay in the subsidence response, i.e. a time-dependence of ground deformations, see [7, 8]. |","Document Type

Glencore’s Sudbury Integrated Nickel Operations includes three underground operations, the Nickel Rim South Mine, Fraser Copper Mine, and Fraser Morgan Mine, all located near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada (Figure 1). 
Fraser Morgan is a nickel deposit accessed via the Fraser Copper Mine infrastructure. Close to 2 million tonnes per year of ore are mined underground from all operations, with Nickel Rim South providing the majority of the material at 1.3 Mt/year. 
All three operations are hard rock mines, with excellent rockmass quality. The depth of mining is sufficient to develop pervasive stress fracturing around most openings (Figure 2).|","Document Type

Circulation loss is a major issue while drilling through naturally fractured reservoirs. Quantitative prediction of the drilling mud loss is therefore critically needed for the control of lost circulation. While it is usually assumed that steady-state rheology of a drilling mud can be described by a yield stress and power law shear thinning, it is not uncommon that a drilling mud exhibits Newtonian or even shear thickening behaviors in the high shear rate range (shear rate <ed><U+00A0><U+00B5><ed><U+00BB><U+00BE> > 1000 1/s). High shear rate rheology governs fluid flow behaviors at early time and is therefore critical to control of lost circulation. In this work, effect of rheology, in particular, the high shear rate rheology, on drilling mud loss in a single natural fracture is investigated. A piecewise rheological model incorporating a yield stress and power laws for both the low shear rate and high shear rate is employed. The natural fracture is assumed to be nearly perpendicular to the wellbore and is initially closed. The problem formulated is solved numerically using an explicit moving mesh algorithm. Effects of the rheological parameters and the leakoff coefficient on the mud loss behaviors are analyzed.
1. INTRODUCTION
Severe lost circulation is a common contributor to the nonproductive time in drilling, in particular in naturally fractured reservoirs. Lost circulation may also cause significant issues in subsequent well completion and reservoir production. Quantitative prediction of the drilling mud loss in a natural fracture is therefore critical for selecting prevention and remedial strategies to control lost circulation. Meanwhile, real-time monitoring of the mud loss in overbalance drilling has commonly been employed as a diagnostic tool for formation characterization [1-3].
Various theoretical models for mud invasion in a single isolated natural fracture have been developed in the literature to solve for the natural fracture permeability based on the mud loss log data [e.g., 4-8]. The basic elements in these theoretical models include assumptions for the fracture orientation and geometry, the fracture deformation law, the leakoff behavior, whether the fracture length is finite or infinite, and whether flow along the fracture is transient or steady state. Drilling mud is generally assumed to be a single-phase fluid with non-Newtonian rheological characteristics such as yield stress and power law shear thinning, e.g., rheology of Herschel-Bulkley type [9]. Extension of these models to include the shut-in phase also allows investigation of various mud or formation fluid flow scenarios [10]. |","Document Type

This paper presents a methodology to analyze the casing integrity in salt layers considering the effects of creep and dissolution on the wellbore closure. The finite element software ABAQUS was adopted to perform the simulations. The dissolution was considered homogeneous and inhomogeneous through a function that turns off the elements located on the wellbore. The progress of material removal obeys to the characteristic dissolution curve of rock salt considered, and the creep was analyzed with a power law function, available in the ABAQUS library. Four cases have been studied: a) wellbore creep without dissolution, b) homogeneous dissolution of the entire wellbore, c) partial dissolution of the wellbore and, d) homogeneous dissolution considering casing decentralization. The results show that the dissolution may slow the contact of the salt with the casing whenever it is homogeneous. For the condition of inhomogeneity point loads can be generated by increasing the stresses on the casing, causing the potential pipe collapse, in addition to modeling time around 5 years, numerical problems are presented due to the high distortions of the elements finite mesh being necessary to use adaptive remeshing techniques to treat such problems. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Large oil fields were discovered on the Brazil coast (Santos Basin) in 2007, in a geological formation known as pre-salt. In the pre-salt region, the depth of water varies between 1000-2000 meters thickness and the seabed varies between 4.000-6.000 meters. Thus, the total depth of the reservoirs below the salt layer can reach 8.000 meters. The Figure 1 shows one example of an oil reservoir in the pre-salt region. |One of the main challenges to cross the salt layers is to ensure the casing integrity because these wells are drilled in complex geological formations, both in the geometric aspect as the mechanical behavior. There are two main effects that can be emphasized: 1) the dissolution of the salt rock due to drilling fluid and 2) the creep after drilling. These effects have opposite results, while the dissolution increases the diameter of the wellbore, the creep decreases it.|","Document Type

A 3D visualization procedure based on micro computed tomography data revealed potential leak paths along the cement-rock interface. The rock-cement bonding was seen to clearly decrease with the presence of drilling fluid/filter cake. The core flooding experiments showed a correlation between the dimensions of interface micro-annuli and measured CO2 flow. However, unpredictable fluid migration was also observed – underlining the importance of understanding how drilling fluid and filter cake behave when subjected to downhole pressures. The results show the importance of updating well integrity procedures for CO2 storage wells in order to manage the risk of CCS projects. Our work shows the integrity of zonal isolation provided by annular and plug cement is difficult to achieve and that modeling with ideal assumptions on leak path shape and properties should be avoided. 
1. INTRODUCTION
A properly designed and constructed well should have zonal isolation; meaning no detectable fluid migration across zones with different pressures. A simplified description of a petroleum well is a wellbore with steel casing(s) placed inside it. Cement is placed in the annulus between the casing and wellbore wall to mechanically support the casing, and to prevent migration of fluids from the reservoir. Over the years of petroleum production, the combination of hands-on experience and research has improved the understanding of cement as a material [1], and the procedures to prevent loss of zonal isolation [2]. Careful cement slurry preparation and use of spacers [3, 4], reciprocating/rotation of casing and casing centralization [5, 6, 7, 8], and control of the flow regime and fluid rheology [9] are some of the many important factors to increase the success rate. |","Document Type

Polygonal faults are thought to potentially compromise the integrity of regional caprocks and are widely developed in mudrocks that are targeted for unconventionals exploration. Polygonal Fault Systems (PFS) contain networks of exclusively normal faults that intersect bedding planes at a wide variety of azimuths. This fact alone suggests a non-tectonic origin and recent arguments focus on a constitutive control on PFS formation. Geomechanical forward modelling has the potential to shed light on the evolution of material and stress state as geological structures form. The evolution of polygonal faults is studied here using the finite strain forward modelling code ELFEN FM. More specifically the recently suggested diagenetic trigger for PFS formation is investigated, and the process of incorporating this into a critical-state based model is outlined and discussed. The results demonstrate the formation of PFS in both 2D plane-strain and full 3D simulations as validation of both the genetic argument and the computational approach. PFS are additionally observed to be sensitive to subtle horizontal stress anisotropy e.g. around salt diapirs or larger tectonic faults. As such, there is the potential for these fault networks to act as ‘paleo-stress piezometers’. This study investigates this by incorporating subtle stress anisotropy into the model and observing the influence on fault alignment. Results indicate that even for subtle stress anisotropy, preferential fault alignment is observed and this is consistent with observation. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The controls on the formation of Polygonal Fault Systems (PFS) remain poorly understood and are still widely debated, despite having been studied for over two decades. These unusual networks of normal faults, which are confined to specific stratigraphic intervals termed ‘tiers’, have been identified on seismic data from over 100 basins worldwide and frequently cover vast areas [1]. The presence of these faults on passive continental margins and particularly basin floors, where regional dips are close to zero, is curious as it implies that they must have formed in regions of low tectonic activity. Hence, the presence of shear failures in what are inferred to be essentially K0 conditions (zero lateral strain) is counter-intuitive. The confinement to tiers coupled with the suggestion that tectonic forces have minimal influence is strongly indicative of a constitutive control on the formation of PFS. Understanding the nature of PFS and the mechanism(s) by which they form is important as all known examples discovered to date are exclusively found in very fine-grained sediments which in some cases form the areal caprock. Therefore, there is the potential for PFS to act as a ‘seal bypass’ [2], and hence they have implications for subsurface fluid migration and therefore hydrocarbon exploration [3]. Additionally, the presence of PFS in the shallow subsurface means that they may present a drilling hazard and compromise efforts aimed at recovery of hydrocarbons. Finally, it has been noted that PFS are often sensitive to subtle horizontal stress anisotropy induced by tectonic faults, slopes or salt diapirs. |","Document Type

A dual-scale modeling approach is proposed to model splitting failure zone in surrounding rock of roadway. Compared with previous models, our model has three innovative points: first, closure effect of pre-existing fracture is considered; second, hyperbolic equation is utilized to describe the path of wing crack propagation which is more closed to reality. third, representative elemental volumes are adopted to tackle the damage localization. The new model is applied to investigate the influence of microcrack parameters on the depth and area of splitting failure zone. This study can be realized due to the implementation of representative elemental volumes. Results show that: with the increase of microcrack length, the depth and area of splitting failure in surrounding rock become lager; with the increase of initial angle, the depth and area of splitting failure in surrounding rock increase first and then decrease, tend to zero finally. When the initial angle is equal to 45°, the depth and area of splitting failure reach a maximum value. When the initial angle is approaching 90°, microcracks form self-locking, splitting failure is significantly inhibited; with the increase of friction coefficient, depth and area of splitting failure are gradually reduced and finally tend to 0. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In China, coal demand increases rapidly due to the rapid economic development. This situation leads to exhausting of shallow coal resources, meanwhile buried depth of mines become larger. The buried depth of some coal mines are even greater than 1000m, such as Zhangxiaolou coal mine, jiahe coal mine, zhangji coal mine et.al. The openings of these coal mines are in high initial stress. During excavating the openings under high initial stress, a large range of splitting failure zones were always observed. This kind of phenomenon has been the experience [1]. Splitting failure always causes the equipment damage, project delay, economic losses. Therefore establishing the splitting failure model play a key role in stability evaluation of deep surrounding rocks and the proper supporting design for openings.|","Document Type

Standard methods to predict pore pressure rely on the assumption that under-compaction is the only mechanism for overpressure generation. For conventional plays, this assumption may be held since the weight of the overlying sediments is supported partly by the rock matrix and partly by the confined interstitial fluids, resulting in an overpressured formation. In a Tight Gas Sand reservoir, it becomes necessary to check the methodologies to predict pore pressure, since the source of overpressure is not clear and the absence of a thick mudrock layer does not allow to find trends of preserved porosity in fine layers. This paper shows a workflow to generate a pore pressure model at reservoir scale in a Tight Gas Sand reservoir. Sonic logs, density logs and DFIT data of around 50 wells were used to correlate the porosity with the vertical effective stress (VES), which is the difference between the overburden and the pore pressure. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In the last five years, unconventional reservoirs in Argentina, particularly in the Neuquen Basin, have been intensively developed, mainly for the needs to have new sources of hydrocarbons to supplement the production of the already exploited conventional reservoirs. 
The difficulties encountered to develop these plays, justify the need to get new and more accurate reservoir data, to revise the methods traditionally used, and to analyze reservoirs from a different perspective. For example, the mechanical behavior of reservoirs started to play a key role in their development, especially at the drilling and stimulation stages. 
Among the geomechanical variables that play a fundamental role in the reservoir development, an accurate pore pressure prediction is fundamental to execute a safe drilling strategy, to accurately perform a production forecast and modelling, and also to establish the stress state, which sets the behavior of the hydraulic fracture. |","Document Type

The deformation of an initially intact caprock, due to the depletion of an underlying reservoir during oil extraction, is geomechanically modeled in three dimensions using a fully coupled poro-elastic model, incorporating plastic damage and fracture models in the caprock. Fractures are represented explicitly in an arbitrary tetrahedral mesh. An isotropic damage model accounts for micro-fracture growth in response to the accumulation of plastic strain. Stress intensity factors, computed using the reduced virtual integration technique, assess potential fracture growth by measuring energy concentrations around the tips. The objectives are to evaluate the locations in the caprock, where damage and fracture propagation are most likely to occur. As a result of poro-elastic deformation during the onset of reservoir depletion, shear driven damage in fractures above and around the well are observed. Extension driven growth is observed in fractures located away from the well. Damage and fracture growth both potentially decrease the caprock integrity, and locally enhance the permeability. 
1. INTRODUCTION
CO2 sequestration at industrial scales is a potentially a viable long-term pathway to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Such a solution relies on the ability to effectively trap CO2 within saline aquifers or oil reservoirs over hundreds or thousands of years, without leakage. The reservoir caprock is an important trapping mechanism which should help ensure that the greenhouse gas remains underground. Caprocks are low permeability rocks, typically shale or anhydrites, which lie on top of the reservoir and mechanically prevent fluids from migrating towards the surface. Caprocks are geological features that have formed over millions of years, and therefore contain a variety of heterogeneities including natural fractures and faults. If reactivated, these fractures and faults could potentially become conduits for fluid to flow to the surface, jeopardizing the effective integrity of the caprock. However, for a caprock to be eligible for CO2 injection, it must have kept its integrity during oil extraction. |","Document Type

Steel casings are cemented in wellbores to ensure that the production of oil and gas can be controlled during the operation of the well and at the well-bore end of life. The sealing properties of the cement are essential in this respect. Loading history during construction and operation of the well and long-term material behavior characteristics may affect the integrity of the cement and its sealing capacity. Several failure potential modes are identified: cracking of cement, shear failure of cement, debonding of cement and casing and de-bonding of cement and rock. In this paper a nonlinear, staggered, heat-transfer-stress analysis for both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional models is presented. The analysis simulates and evaluates the sealing properties of the cement and calculates the chance that one or more of the failure modes occurs. In the analysis both the construction phases of the well and typical loadings during operation, such as over-pressures and temperature changes, as well as abandonment phase, are considered. Some examples of numerical models are presented and discussed.
1. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE
Different types of cement are available such as:
• conventional cement, with a relatively high stiffness, showing a significant level of shrinkage during hardening, 
• cements with additives such as rubber, being more flexible with a small level of shrinkage, and
• expanding cements
For unstable boreholes, or in wells located in rock with strong anisotropic stress conditions, or in wells which are exposed to strong variations of temperature or pressure in the well, more flexible cements with limited shrinkage or expanding cements are required to ensure the integrity of the cement during the life of the well. The market-price of cements however, with additives for expanding cement, is considerably higher than conventional cements and so there is a need to quantify the necessary cement properties to suit specific well-conditions.|","Document Type

Modeling the evolution of geological structures from deposition through to the current day can provide useful insight, such as better knowledge of the stress and material state evolution, development of overpressures, thermal history, and timings related to the maturation of hydrocarbons. This paper discussions one method of simulating the evolution of various structures via a quasi-static explicit adaptive finite element framework that is adopted based on a Lagrangian description of the kinematics and uses the forward modeling software ELFEN FM.  The large strains encountered in many cases lead to scenarios of extreme layer thinning and suitable automated strategies for mitigating the impact of such cases on the quality of the solution are critical. Therefore, this paper focuses on this computational modeling topic and via conceptual examples the capabilities of the methodology are demonstrated. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Forward modeling technology has the ability to capture the development of geological structures at local or regional scales from deposition through to current day. This has the potential to provide exploration teams with useful geomechanical insight, particularly regarding potential stress and material state in reservoir units and adjacent layers, and regions of developed overpressures. Such information may be of significant benefit in terms of outlining potential strategies for field development and may be critical to the recovery of both conventional and unconventional resources. For example, recent studies have highlighted differences in the magnitudes of stresses adjacent to salt structures when they were analyzed using conventional static e.g. as used in [1], and forward modeling approaches [2]. Additionally, folding studies in the Caspian using forward modeling software detailed in this paper has yielded promising results both in terms of matching the structural style and accurately recovering pore pressure distributions [3]. |","Document Type

A physically-motivated dual-scale modeling approach is proposed to model the time-dependent damage, deformation and fracturing behavior of heterogeneous brittle rocks during creep. The proposed model uses a microcrack-based damage constitutive law established at the elemental scale, in which the time-dependent degradation of elastic stiffness and damage-induced anisotropy are directly linked to microcrack growth. The evolution of mechanical heterogeneity is based on a Weibull distribution that captures the transition from distributed damage to localized failure. The key feature of the proposed model is to establish an adequate prediction of macroscopic creep behavior based on the microscopic kinetics of microcrack growth rather than the phenomenological material degradation laws adopted in previously-developed statistical models. The general capabilities of the proposed model are illustrated with numerical simulations of biaxial creep tests. The influence of differential stresses on creep behavior in brittle rocks is also examined. Results from such analyses indicate that the proposed model not only accurately replicates the trimodal phases of creep deformation and the associated temporal evolution of acoustic emission but also follows the progressive evolution of fracture modes and morphology commonly observed. Thus, subject to suitable calibration, this model provides an attractive virtual experimental tool to probe process-based understanding of complex long-term problems related to structures in geologic media. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding creep response of rocks in the Earth’s crust is but one of many challenges that relate to characterizing natural and engineered processes related to earthquake rupture, the triggering of volcanic eruptions, failure in underground mining, hydrocarbon and geothermal energy recovery and hazardous waste disposal, among others [1]. The modeling of timedependent deformation and fracturing of rocks under creep conditions is fundamental to better assessing the precursory phenomena of geohazards or predicting the long-term stability and safety of engineering facilities.|","Document Type

An on-going project at the University of Arizona is using Kartchner Caverns in Benson, Arizona as a natural analog to study time-dependent rock failure with subcritical crack growth modeling. Various material properties of the Escabrosa limestone composing the caverns are required for input into the damage model. Central among these properties are the subcritical crack growth parameters n and A, which can be calculated from modes I, II, and III fracture toughness tests conducted at different loading rates. This paper presents the results of modes I, II, and III testing on Escabrosa limestone, providing the material properties necessary for the larger goal of modeling breakdown in Kartchner Caverns and applying the model to the long-term stability of rock excavations. Additionally, fracture test results are compared with a previous study by Tae Young Ko at the University of Arizona, which tested Coconino sandstone and determined that the subcritical crack growth parameters were consistent among modes. This study expands upon Ko’s work by adding the characterization of a second rock material in all three modes; preliminary results indicate that for Escabrosa limestone the subcritical crack growth parameters are not consistent among modes. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Time-dependent rock failure is an important aspect in the analysis of long-term rock stability for slopes, dam and bridge foundations, and underground storage facilities. Under short-term loading, a crack will propagate when the stress intensity factor at the crack tip exceeds a critical value: the fracture toughness. Subcritical crack growth is the propagation of a crack at values of the stress intensity factor smaller than the fracture toughness. This type of growth happens under long-term loading and is environmentally-assisted, occurring through mechanisms such as stress corrosion, diffusion, microplasticity, dissolution, and ion exchange [1, 2]. There are three modes of crack tip displacement in critical and subcritical crack growth: mode I (tension), mode II (in-plane shear), and mode III (out-of-plane shear).|","Document Type

We have been conducting shale research for more than four decades in Oilfield as well as Coal mines. Since late 1960s, our work has dealt with troublesome shale as a source of well bore instability or coal mine roof falls near ventilation shafts. We quickly found that the shale issues must be addressed by simultaneously taking into account the combined chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the shale. To accomplish this, we introduced the thermodynamic properties of the shale based on its specific percentage of clay content. This technique, along with sound and practical petroleum engineering practices, guided us to successfully design the mud systems, tailored for drilling long sections of troublesome shale, and resolve the issues of well bore instability, ultrafine contamination, lost circulation, slow drilling. In addition to considering shale as a source of hazard, since mid 1970s, we have been involved with research that considers shale gas/liquid as a viable economic resource and how to best extract these natural energy resources from shale that could be categorized as “troublesome shale.” 
In this work, regarding the recovery of the natural energy resources, we share our recent results and conclusions about the following questions and their significance to both Roof Control in Coal Mining and Petroleum Engineering:
1. Shale in contact with water vapor: Application to Mining Engineering, specifically to Roof Control in Coal Mining near the ventilation shaft or the main shaft, we answer questions related to interaction of water vapor appearing in ventilation system and shale• Is there any water in the gas shale that seemingly appears dry? • How do the micro-fracture networks in shale grow? • At what specific sites do these micro-fracture networks initiate? • Why these micro-fractures do not develop in some specimens that have almost the same type and concentration of clay minerals? • What kind of fracture develops in these networks?
2. Shale in contact with water: Application to Petroleum Engineering we answer questions dealing with immersion of shale in water: • At what specific sites is the gas stored within the shale mass? • Could there be any relationship between the activated sites of “free gas,” which may result in the development of localized “pore pressure” in the “pickled” shale mass and the appearance of the fault within the same specimen? • Is the fault appearing in the “pickled” shale specimen strictly a normal fault? • How many types of gas flow behavior can we expect from the “pickled” gas shale? • Is the gas flow from the “pickled” gas shale cyclic within a short time or steady over long periods? • For how long, at a minimum, should we shut-in the well after hydraulic fracturing for optimal gas production results? 
To answer the above questions we find that we need to understand what shale is before dealing with it as a resource material or control it when it poses engineering issues. |","Document Type

Large underground powerhouse caverns in the mighty Himalayan region during construction and their operation after their completion experiencing instabilities, which are need to be monitored for life time using a real time regional monitoring systems for the safety of the structure, installed machinery and workmen. These structures experienced many incidents of strata instabilities during construction period including large roof falls and even during its operation in the form of large number of rockbolt violent failures etc. Since the conventional instrumentation that was installed during construction was not able to provide adequate information about the regional stability. A high resolution sixty channel real time, remote monitoring microseismic system was established in one of the project site with the objective to provide information related to the regional strata behaviour in real time and to address the regional structural and strata stability around the powerhouse caverns. The microseismic data is continuously recorded, auto processed and displayed in near real time at the central data recording laboratory situated inside the underground powerhouse and at regional data processing centers located far away from the site. 
The microseismic data acquired were analyzed and mapped on the 3D plan of the caverns. Statistical data analysis using source parameters of microseismic events were carried out to correlate the events with rock bolt failures in order to study the signatures of the precursory signals. Few microseismic events occurred in clusters at some regions and majority of the microseismic events have the local magnitudes in the range of at about -2.5. The range of recorded events local magnitudes indicates that the cavern was stable during the monitoring period, there is no development of stress pockets or migration (changes in stress) of stress regime. The changes in the stress have been very low indicating the stability of the strata. The recorded low values show the efficiency of the monitoring system in response to minor changes of strata behaviour. 
This paper presents the real time microseismic monitoring of regional strata behaviour of the underground hydro powerhouse caverns for about a period of one and half year after the commissioning of real time monitoring system in September 2013 and correlation of microseismic activity to explain the rock bolt failures and the caverns regional strata stability. |","Document Type

During the development of unconventional oil and gas, multi -staged fracturing within horizontal well is used to create several fractures in one stage at one time. During the stimulation operation process, the present fracture will probably connect to the other established fractures in present stage or the former stage, which leads to hydraulic fractures difficult to effectively spread. A hydraulic fracture influences the extending direction of other fractures, namely, causing certain attraction or repulsion effect. In this paper, finite element calculation is made to simulate the interaction of fractures with different spacing and lengths. The results show that when the two fractures are extending in the same pace, the interaction will gradually change from repulsion to attraction with the spacing of two fractures getting closer. On the other hand, when the two fractures both are extending but not synchronously, both fractures will curve towards the side of the shorter fracture if the spacing is relatively small compared to the fractures’ length. In addition, an already formed fracture will attract a newborn fracture at a short distance, but repel it at a longer distance.

We simulated the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)-sponsored Jointed Limestone Test (JOLT) using the Abaqus fully coupled Euler-Lagrange computation scheme. JOLT was a small-scale experiment consisting of over 37,000 individual cubes of limestone surrounding simulated tunnels. This test bed was loaded with ground shock generated by a spherical CompB charge, thereby providing data for the study of computer codes used to compute the response of buried tunnels to explosive loading. We modeled the cubes as continuum blocks with contact, making for a dis-continuum simulation using a hybrid continuum code including Eulerian modeling of the explosive region and Lagrangian modeling of the remainder of the test bed. This paper has been approved for unlimited release under LA-UR-15-21382.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has funded studies of tunnel vulnerability to blast effects for decades. The studies have included experiments of various complexity and scale as well as numerical analysis. Several projects have combined computational studies with experiments to validate predictive algorithms. Numerical approaches have evolved based not only on prior knowledge but also due to advances in computing hardware and software capabilities. The focus of this paper is on a recent three-dimensional (3-D) simulation effort, but we will also provide some background material by describing an older twodimensional (2-D) computational effort that laid some of the groundwork for this later work

The MIGHTY NORTH event was a laboratory-scale high explosive test performed in the mid-90s to investigate various approaches to numerical simulation of the response of tunnels to explosive-induced ground shock [1, 2]. The test bed (Figure 1) consisted of 1.2-m long, 5-cm square cross-section bars of limestone stacked in an imbricate pattern to simulate a layered, jointed geologic setting. The “block of bricks” was 2 m square in section and 2 m long. The center of the block included a 0.4-m diameter aluminum-lined “tunnel.”|","Document Type

Sand grains can be dislodged and mobilized when exposed to high fluid flow drag forces in oil recovery from poorly consolidated sandstone reservoirs. Sand production usually enhances the wellbore inflow performances; however the drawbacks such as erosion and clogging of production lines and premature water breakthrough in waterflooding outweigh the benefits. In this study, an existing coupled 3-D multiphase flow/geomechanical code is further developed and implemented to model the propagation of dilated zone resulting from sand production. The dilated zone grows when the forces from fluid flow exceed the confining effective forces. The constituent materials’ mechanical behavior is described by a nonlinear hyperbolic model in which the stress variation over the Mohr-Coulomb shear failure surface is honored by a force rebalancing scheme. The study results indicate that the dilated zone geometry is a strict function of the weak layer thickness. The small load bearing capacity of the failed region leads to formation of a low stressed strip at the cavity/sand interface which aids the sand production by pressure gradient. The results of the current study can help understanding the significance of different mechanisms contributing to sand production in order to mitigate the premature water breakthrough problem in oilfield waterflooding practices.
1. INTRODUCTION
Drag forces concomitant with fluid flow through loosely consolidated porous media might be strong enough to dislodge and mobilized the distorted sand grains towards the producer. The sand production phenomenon usually leads to a significant enhancement in well productivity [1]. Nonetheless, uncontrolled sand production may result in operational problems such as costly workovers in flow production eroded equipment and the environmental issues associated with disposal of produced sand [2, 3]. Sand production usually deteriorates the sweep efficiency causing premature water breakthrough in field waterflooding operations. The problem costs the oil and gas industry hundreds of millions dollars annually [4].
Various causes of sand removal from loose formations into production wells have been quoted by different authors [5, 6]. Vaziri et. al. [6] have divided sand production into early pressure induced and later production or water-cut induced stages. The former stage is triggered mainly by mutual acts of high drag forces and mechanically weak formation. However the latter is regarded to reduction in inter-granular capillary tension due to increase in water-cut. Dissolved gas liberation in multi-phase flow (i.e., foamy oil in heavy oil reservoir) is also a significant contributing factor in sand production [1, 4]. Morita and Boyd [7] have mentioned some sand production problems observed in the field due to reservoir pressure depletion in relatively strong formations, abnormally high tectonic force in relatively strong formations and sudden changes in flow rate.|","Document Type

Interactions between aqueous drilling fluids and clay minerals have been identified as an important factor in wellbore instability of shale formations. Current wellbore stability models consider the interactions between aqueous drilling fluids and pore fluid but their interactions with shale matrix is neglected. This study provides a realistic method to incorporate the interaction mechanism into wellbore stability analysis through laboratory experiment and mathematical modeling. The adsorption isotherms of two shale rocks, Catoosa shale and Mancos shale are obtained. The adsorption isotherms of the selected shales are compared with those of other shale types in the literature. It is shown that the adsorption isotherms of various shale rocks can be scaled using their respective cation exchange capacity, into a single adsorption curve. The experimental results show that the moisture content of shale is correlated with water activity using a multilayer adsorption theory. The adsorption parameters can be suggested as an index to characterize different shale formations. This study shows that the adsorption theory can be used to generalize wellbore stability problem in order to consider the case of non-ideal drilling fluids. Furthermore, the adsorption model can be combined with empirical correlations to update the compressive strength of shale under downhole conditions. Accordingly, a chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability simulator is developed to explore the stability of transversely isotropic shale formations. The coupled transport equations are solved using an implicit finite difference method. The results of this study indicate that the range of safe mud weight reduces due to the moisture adsorption phenomenon. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Shale rocks are often regarded as weak rocks in terms of compressive and tensile strength. It is known that presence of bedding planes and lamination imparts anisotropy to mechanical properties of rocks. The effect of bedding plane on rock failure has long been recognized [1-3]. Drilling through shale formations is often associated with borehole instability problems. York et al. (2009) reported that the wellbore instability issues in a well with 20,000 ft MD could at least cost 2.5 million dollars [4]. Hamayun (2011) discussed the results of a survey that indicates about one third of Non-Productive Time (NPT) of drilling operations is spent on wellbore problems, of which a major portion is attributed to the wellbore instability issues [5]. Hydration of clay minerals is recognized to be one of the important interaction processes between shale and drilling fluid during drilling process, which often leads to various operational problems such as shale swelling, stuck pipe, reduction of rate of penetration [6, 7]. Usually two kinds of clay swelling is realized, namely, the interacrystalline swelling due to the hydration of exchangeable cations and osmotic swelling which occurs due to a large difference between ion concentration (or water activity) of shale and aqueous fluids [8-10]. |","Document Type

This paper represents a grain-based discrete element model for simulating the quasi-brittle failure of polycrystalline rocks considering the grain-scale geometrical and material heterogeneities of geo-material fabric. A rock material is represented by an assembly of polygonal grains bonded through their cohesive contacts. As a result, the micro-fracturing process can be simulated explicitly by development of crack along grain boundaries. Micro-mechanical parameters of the model is calibrated to Lac du Bonnet granite such that the model reproduces the physics similar to those of the rock during compression and tension. The calibration procedure is based on categorizing a set of input parameters that controls the elastic and fracture behavior of the model. The relation between macro-properties such as strength, friction and cohesion of the model and input micro-mechanical properties assigned to grains and interfaces is investigated by simulating a series of compressive triaxial and Brazilain tensile tests. The numerical experimentations demonstrate the capability of discrete element-Voronoi model to mimic the pre- and post-failure responses of brittle materials. The calibrated model very accurately predicts, in a quantitative sense, the macroscopic properties of real granite such as elastic properties, damage thresholds (crack initiation and interaction stresses), peak strengths (tensile and compression strengths), triaxial strength envelope (friction angle and cohesion). Results demonstrate the importance of considering the microstructural heterogeneity of rock fabric for successful modelling of brittle rock fracture.
1. INTRODUCTION
The process of brittle rock fracture during compression and tension is a result of the initiation, growth, and coalescence of multiple individual micro-cracks which eventually leads to formation of some clustered regions of macro-fractures in rock. As the compressive, or tensile stress applies across the boundaries of a rock sample, a complex heterogeneous stress system will be distributed through the rock in which the tensile and shear stresses will be concentrated at pre-existing flaws (i.e. micro-cracks, grain boundaries, cavities, cleavages) [1]. If the localized tensile stress exceeds the local strength of the microstructure some micro-cracks start to form at the point on the boundary of pre-existing flaw where tensile stress concentration is greatest. These axially aligned extensional micro-cracks occur during the early loading stages of compression tests. As the applied deviatoric stresses increase in the specimen, the density of compression-induced tensile cracks increases, and eventual interaction and coalescence of these cracks result in formation of some localized and macroscopic damaged zones in the material. It is the presence and creation of such micro-fractures that cause the compressional stress-strain curve of rock to deviate from true elastic (linearity) in the pre-failure region [2].|","Document Type

Here we present the capabilities of a novel apparatus under development that can accommodate both double-direct and triaxial shear configurations to investigate friction at low to high-speed (up to 2 m/s) sliding conditions. The high acceleration capability of the loading-system is complementary to other high-speed testing machines, and is particularly well suited for study of rate-dependence of friction at high normal stress and of transient behavior associated with dynamic weakening. Preliminary friction experiments at normal stress of approximately 5 MPa have been conducted to investigate transient friction associated with slip velocity steps from low to high speed sliding (>0.5 m/s). Results show that, independent of surface roughness, friction increases concurrently with a step increase to high velocity and then decreases with slip consistent with the direct and evolution effects documented for rate-state friction behavior at quasi-static slip rates. Friction during sustained highspeed sliding is characterized by a steady and substantial weakening that likely reflects the accumulation of fine wear product along the surfaces. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Experiments designed to investigate the frictional behavior of rock generally involve sliding the surfaces of two blocks of rock past each other. In these tests the rock blocks do not fail or break but slide on either fractured or pre-cut, prepared surfaces with or without an intervening layer of granular material called gouge by analogy with natural faults (e.g., [1]). The coefficient of sliding friction is represented by the stress across the sliding surface, specifically the shear stress parallel to the sliding direction divided by the normal stress on the surface. Friction tests can be conducted on unconfined or confined samples. The normal load in unconfined tests is limited by the fracture strength of the rock blocks, typically on the order of 50 MPa. In confined tests, samples are sealed in an impermeable membrane and surrounded by a pressurized gas or a fluid at a confining pressure, Pc. Confined tests simulate the high pressure condition at depth in the earth where an earthquake occurs. Samples also may be permeated by a fluid, normally water, at a pore fluid pressure, Pp.
Recent experimental investigations of friction in rock and gouge appropriate to earthquake slip using high-speed apparatus demonstrate pronounced reduction in the apparent coefficient of friction at seismic slip rates greater than 0.1 m/s, which likely reflects lubrication by generation of melt or ultrafine wear particles, thermalchemical processes such as flash heating and thermal decomposition, and dynamic thermal fluid pressurization within thin slip zones. Recent past and current development of testing devices is aimed at improving our ability to investigate coseismic friction weakening at all conditions of earthquake rupture (specifically slip velocity, normal stress, fluid states, ambient temperature) and develop relations for scaling (spatial and temporal) laboratory results to natural earthquake faulting.|","Document Type

As a leading cause of injuries in underground coal mines, roof fall has been widely investigated with different methods. The majority of the research was conducted without considering the time factor. In fact, field observation show that the roof fall involves a time-dependent failure process. To investigate roof failure, UDEC was used to simulate the time-dependent fracturing process associated with creep of rock mass. The rock mass around an opening was meshed into small Voronoi blocks, and parameters for the joints between these blocks were calibrated to make uniaxial compressive strength of a 4m<U+00D7>8m rock block approximately equal to that of rock mass. The cracks caused by stress redistribution under different conditions can be captured by this method. After equilibrium, creep simulation was run to a predetermined time. Limited cracks forming within roof and intensive cracks forming within coal pillars are observed under different conditions, including high stress ratio, laminations, and smaller excavation width. When the yield condition and crack formation are combined, better simulation results can be obtained.
1. INTRODUCTION
According to MSHA (2014), improvements in roof control technology have significant decreased fatality, but roof fall accidents are still a leading cause of injuries in underground coal mines. This safety problem has been investigated for decades. Overbey et al. [1] considered surface fracture trace density, changes in roof rock type, and topographic unloading due to drainage the three major factors affecting the occurrence of roof fall, and proposed a technique to predict probable roof fall areas ahead of mining operations. Aggson [2] theoretically summarized the roof failure mechanisms under different conditions. Su and Peng [3] examined the intrinsic mechanisms of cutter roof failure by combining field investigation, laboratory testing, underground instrumentation, and numerical modeling, and found that high vertical stress coupled with a stiffer coal is the dominant factor in the formation of cutter roof. Gadde and Peng [4] proposed one approach using a strain-softening model to simulate the cutter initiation and propagation process. Then this method was used by Ray [5] to study the influence of cutting sequence on cutters and roof fall in underground mines. Gao and Stead [6] simulated the formation of cutter roof failure with 3DEC and PFC3Dwith respect to the orientation of major horizontal stress and the forward of excavation. Coggan et al. [7] used continuum, discontinuum, and hybrid finite element-discrete element codes to model the deformation of Coal Measure strata, and the modelled results demonstrated that the thickness of the relatively weak mudstone in the roof of the tunnel has a significant influence on the extent of failure. |","Document Type

A basin-wide simulation of wastewater injection is performed for the Fort Worth Basin. Uncertainties in geology and limited availability of injection data were two of the main challenges that were encountered during the course of the research. Simulation results show some spatial and temporal correlation between the pore pressure change and earthquakes occurrence. There are also areas of substantial predicted pore pressure increase where no seismicity is detected. The results suggest that proper assessment of seismic risk requires good subsurface geology (flow characteristics and pre-existing fault geometry) as well as well injection rate and pressure data. p>
1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
One of the very first studies on induced seismicity due to fluid injection was performed on the Denver earthquakes which occurred in the 1960’s due to injection into a disposal well at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA) [1]. Injection into the well at the RMA occurred between from 1962 to 1966 with a variable injection rate at different times during the injection periods [1, 2]. It was observed that seismic events continued to occur even after fluid injection was stopped [1, 2]. A few years following the event, an experiment conducted in Rangely, Colorado concluded that fluid injection can be used to control seismic events [3].
Since the 1960s, the link between earthquake clusters and disposal wells has been extensively examined [4]. Research has been done to correlate the various parameters, such as injection pressure and reservoir transmissivity, to the occurrence of induced earthquakes [1-4]. Yet, even though the mechanics behind induced earthquake is established, risk assessment and prediction is still difficult [1-4]. |","Document Type

Closure of rough surfaces under normal closure stress is investigated in this study. Rough surface closure model presented in this paper is based on surface asperity deformation. The main components of deformation are asperity compression and half-space deformation. Mechanical interaction among asperities which is a consequence of half-space deformation is considered in the model and its impact on the closure behavior is analyzed. Asperities are assumed to be elastic-perfectly-plastic materials and therefore may experience inelastic deformation under closure stress. Modeling results indicate that a significant portion of closure takes place earlier on at low stress levels because there are fewer asperities in contact initially. Asperity inelastic deformation is found to influence rough surface closure with its degree of impact depending on surface profile. A mechanical interaction sensitivity analysis indicates that neglecting interaction among asperities may lead to erroneous results particularly in surfaces with closely spaced asperities. By conducting an analysis on the elastic properties of asperity and half-space we found that the normal stiffness is much more influenced by Young’s modulus of half-space rather than that of asperity. |1. INTRODUCTION
Acid fracturing is a stimulation technique which is being used in carbonate reservoirs. This technique is considered as an alternative to the well-known propped hydraulic fracturing. Fractures tend to close due to the in-situ stresses acting normal to the plane of fracture. Fracture closure has detrimental effect on the conductivity and therefore, should be prevented. Proppant is widely used in the hydraulic fracturing process and this material serves to keep the fracture open against closure stress. However, the mechanism by which the fracture is being held open is essentially different in acid fracturing technique.
Acid fracturing is a complex process in which acid reacts with rock and removes some parts of it, resulting in two random rough surfaces. Asperities on these surfaces act as pillars to keep the fracture open. Fracture surfaces come into contact after the pump pressure is dissipated. The success of an acid fracturing job depends on how well the asperities withstand the closure stress. Increasing effective stress often reduces the fracture aperture and its conductivity.|","Document Type

Rockbursts, or coal bumps in coal mines, involve the spontaneous, violent fracture of rock. This paper discusses the application of energy concepts to back-analysis studies of coal bump events. Two-dimensional distinct element models were constructed of coal pillars with a range of material properties assigned to both coal material and rock-coal interfaces. These models were used to explore the compounding effects of the brittle failures of coal material and coal-rock interfaces on the energy release magnitudes. Loading conditions applied to these models represent a pillar failing individually as well as a full panel collapse. Results from the pillar models are presented in terms of the kinetic energy released from the unstable failures. Due to variation of coal and coal-rock interface properties, the magnitude of the excess kinetic energy was found to vary significantly. The total magnitude of kinetic energy released from the models was found to be significantly higher when brittle failure behavior was assigned to both the coal and to the coal-rock interface. This increase in excess energy indicated larger unstable failures and higher dynamic efficiencies under such material combination. In addition to the methodology for analyzing the effect of coal material and interface properties on the pillar failure stability, the paper also introduces and demonstrates a feasible failure mode for large widthheight ratio pillars.
1. INTRODUCTION
Compressive and shear slip failures emerge in deep underground mines under the influence of mining activities. Historically, several research efforts were made to address the role of excess energy on the initiation and occurrence of rockbursts, which included the Energy Release Rate (ERR) concept proposed by Cook [1] and Excess Shear Stress (ESS) presented by Ryder [2]. However, neither of these approaches accounts for brittle failure of rock and they have therefore not been ordinarily applied to study rockburst or coal bump incidents. In this paper, the commercially available software Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC) is used to numerically model the failure instabilities and to present an illustration based on the unstable excess energy concept.
UDEC maintains the ability to simulate the quasi-brittle behavior of discontinuities through the Continuousyielding (CY) joint property [3, 4]. The Mohr-Coulomb strain-softening (MCSS) constitutive model may then be used to represent quasi-brittle material failure during unstable loading conditions [5]. The program also calculates the kinetic energy released and ultimately damped out during the simulation. A series of single pillar models were built with these combinations of tools to better understand the mechanism of bumps within wide coal pillars.|","Document Type

Rock fractures are of considerable engineering significance in fields such as hard rock tunneling and fractured rock hydrology. Fracture traces – the 2d manifestations of fractures at exposed rock surfaces – can provide valuable information about the rock mass. Of particular interest is estimating the distribution, or the mean and variance, of fracture size based on inevitably censored and biased field observations. This paper describes a novel and powerful tool – termed an image window – that can aid in the quantitative interpretation of fracture trace data. Image windows are used for the construction of subfields corresponding to regions of the rock mass that define the loci of fractures for certain types of intersection between fractures and the sampling window. Counts of the various types of fracture intersection on exposures can then be used to help infer the size characteristics of fractures in the rock mass in a meaningful way. The method can be applied in one or two dimensions towards estimating size characteristics of fractures traces, or, in three dimensions, to infer the size characteristics of fractures embedded in a 3-d rock mass and exposed at a 2-d sampling surface. We show how to construct image windows in one or two dimensions, and we introduce the construction of image windows in three dimensions. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock fractures are significant in several engineering fields, including hard rock tunneling and fractured rock hydrology; and fracture traces – the 2d manifestations of fractures at exposed rock surfaces - can provide useful information about the fractures in the rock mass. During site investigation or, e.g., tunnel excavation, the limited exposures of traces are used for estimation of the mean and variance of trace length, and other statistical information about the fracture and fracture trace populations. Such inferences must take into account unavoidable biases and censoring of the data obtained from the rock exposure [1–7].
This paper describes a novel and powerful approach to the interpretation of fracture trace data, using what the author terms image windows. The method automatically corrects for sampling biases and the effects of censoring. In addition to deriving information about the underlying population of fracture traces, we show how the technique can be used to derive information about the distributional parameters of fracture size in the 3d rock mass, not just the trace length. |","Document Type

This work demonstrates the potential of using the hybrid finite-discrete element method (FDEM) to model thermal and mechanical coupling mechanisms around a wellbore in shale formations. The simulated thermal and mechanical stresses were first validated in separate models by comparing them to closed-form solutions. Then, the stability of a borehole in Opalinus Clay (Mont Terri, Switzerland) was analyzed. The prominent mechanism affecting the wellbore stability was found to be the mud pressure applied to the excavation boundary. At lower in-situ stresses, the extent of fracturing due to tensile stresses from cooling the rock by -100 °C was greater than at higher stress regimes. This was due to the greater stress differential between the mud pressure and the stress field in the higher stress regime. The higher mud pressure counteracts the thermal stresses and thus less fractures develop. It was also observed that the choice of constitutive model (i.e., isotropic versus anisotropic) had little effect on the temperature change required for fracture initiation, but it did influence the fracture pattern due to preferential planes of weakness present in the bedded Opalinus Clay. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Wellbore instability has long been an issue in the oil and gas industry which has resulted in estimated monetary losses of 8 billion US$ per year worldwide [1]. Instability issues have more often been observed when drilling through shale formations. As the hole is being excavated, drilling fluids have an integral role in stabilizing the hole since they cool the drill bit, remove drill cuttings, prevent formation fluids from entering the well and stabilize the borehole walls [2]. 
Inherently, the drilling fluids interact with the rock formation through thermal exchanges and chemical interactions. It is typical to encounter reservoir temperatures which are greater than the temperature of the drilling fluids [3]. As a result of cooling the formation, the rock tends to contract and a reduction of hoop stress is generated, effectively lowering the fracture gradient [4]; thus increasing the likelihood of developing tensile fractures at the hole wall. This mechanism may cause fractures to nucleate which in turn may result in wellbore instability.|","Document Type

C., Halliburton; Colorado School of Mines| Matzar, L., Halliburton| Hu, D., Halliburton| Gutierrez, M., Colorado School of Mines","|Abstract
Hydraulic fracturing is performed in unconventional oil and gas and enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) reservoirs to enhance formation permeability and create a conductive pathway for fluid flow to one or multiple wellbores. Typically, energy production requires the existence of a densely naturally fractured medium or a complex hydraulic fracture network or, in some cases, both. When targeting a naturally fractured reservoir, stimulation is meant to provide a connection between these natural fractures to generate large regions of hydraulically connected rock for production. Although hydraulic fracturing is performed often in naturally faulted or fractured media, the geometry and effectiveness of the hydraulic fracture crossing natural discontinuities is not well-understood. To better understand hydraulic fracture interactions with discontinuities, laboratory scale hydraulic fracturing tests were performed which contained an idealized case of one large angled discontinuity, or natural fracture. Two-block sample sizes of 15<U+00D7>15<U+00D7>25 cm3were subjected to true triaxial confinement before wellbore placement and completion. Acoustic emissions (AE) were monitored during the fracture initiation, propagation, and fracture interaction process. An in depth post-test analysis was performed on AE microcrack data to characterize the hydraulic fracture and determine its effectiveness crossing the discontinuity. Individual microcrack mode of failure was determined as well as relative volumetric deformation using moment tension inversion techniques. Both sides of the natural fracture were compared in terms of source mechanism information of microcracks to determine if changes in failure characteristics occurred. Post-test visualization of the hydraulic fractures at the surface provided an image of severe fracture dimension reduction, particularly fracture width and crossing the natural fracture. AE characterization was compared with visual inspections to determine if AE source parameters correlated with observed post-fracture imaging data. Implications of drastic hydraulic fracture width reductions crossing natural fractures include under predictions of stimulated reservoir volume from field scale AE data, and reduced production.|","granite, hydraulic fracturing,  and laboratory,  moment tensor analysis,  acoustic emission (AE),  natural fracture"

M., SINTEF Petroleum Research| Holt, R. M., Norwegian University of Science and Technology; SINTEF Petroleum Research","|Abstract
Static and dynamic moduli differ a lot, also in rocks with no dispersion. In particular, the static:dynamic stiffness ratio is very sensitive to the stress path. The ability to model this behavior is important for several applications, for instance in situations where static moduli are needed while only dynamic moduli are accessible by measurements. This paper discusses the impact of friction controlled sliding along grain contacts and crack surfaces. A classical grain pack model which incorporates this effect is found to describe several of the main characteristic features of the static:dynamic relations, suggesting that friction controlled sliding is a dominating effect. Some discrepancies between model and observations can probably be related to the regular structure of the grain pack model versus the irregular microstructure of a real rock.
1. INTRODUCTION
The term ""static moduli"" is commonly referring to the set of stiffness parameters defined as a ratio between an applied stress increment and the resulting strain increment, while ""dynamic moduli"" is referring to the set of stiffness parameters that can be derived from density times an elastic wave velocity squared. Corresponding static and dynamic moduli are equal for a linearly elastic material. For heterogeneous materials like porous rocks, static and dynamic moduli may differ significantly [1,2]. There are several potential causes for this:
a) Strain rate. Deformation of a rock may involve several processes that require some time to complete. The rock's resistance against deformation may therefore depend on the strain rate. The relevant strain rate for a dynamic modulus is primarily given by the frequency of the elastic wave. The strain rate associated with a static modulus depends on the loading conditions. For a standard laboratory test, the ""static"" strain rate corresponds to an elastic wave with frequency in the lower seismic range [3].|","Document Type

Laboratory hydraulic fracturing experiments were performed on a single true triaxially confined granite specimen with samples sizes of 15<U+00D7>15<U+00D7>25 cm3and monitored with acoustic emission (AE) to simulate the field development of oil, gas, and enhanced geothermal systems reservoirs. Pump pressure, wellhead pressure, pump flow, applied triaxial stresses, and AE were monitored throughout testing. AE was monitored and extensively analyzed post-testing for source location, AE event attributes, and source mechanism characterization. Mode of failure of each individual microcrack was determined using AE moment tensor inversion techniques. Orientation and direction of crack displacement vector and crack face normal vectors were calculated from an eigenvector decomposition of the moment tensor solution and provided valuable information regarding how individual microcracks contribute to an image of the overall coalesced hydraulic fracture. Further analysis was performed to determine if trends existed between boundary stress conditions and the crack vector information. Several events were observed to have similar microcrack displacement vector orientations compared to principal stress directions. Comparisons between crack displacement vector orientations and mode of failure were also examined. The usefulness of the AE microcrack displacement vector information is apparent when understanding rock damage and possible alterations of the flow behavior near hydraulic fractures. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing has become a standard practice in oil- and gas-bearing formations because of the high commonality of nanodarcy permeability source rock in several of these reservoirs. A dense hydraulic fracture and wellbore connected natural fracture network is desired to reach as many isolated hydrocarbon-rich pores and natural fractures as possible. Although dense fracture networks are desired, even if they are obtained, much of the rock between and near the fracture faces contribute very little to production because of the extremely low permeability. It is desirable to understand the microcracking process very near these fracture faces and throughout the macro-scale hydraulic fracture network to determine the affected changes to the reservoir rock, which can alter the near fracture rock permeability. |","moment tensor inversion,  acoustic emission (AE),  and laboratory,  microcrack, hydraulic fracturing,  granite,  in situ stress"

Rock fracability characterization is a key issue for unconventional reservoirs stimulation. This property not only controls hydraulic fracture initiating and propagating pressure, but also affects the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) which determines well productivity. Several parameters such as brittleness, plasticity and toughness among others are frequently referred in the literature to describe rock fracability. This paper discusses the validity of some of these parameters and emphasizes the fracture mechanics approach to characterize rock fracability based on the critical stress intensity factor (KIC).
An experimental study was conducted using synthetic and real Vaca Muerta (VM) shale samples. KIC was determined using two types of specimens, the notched Brazilian disc and the semicircular three point load tests. The influence of applied load rate, material composition and medium was analyzed. The implications of these parameters in the hydraulic fracture process are discussed. The experimental results were compared with KIC values calculated using information obtained from Vaca Muerta fracture jobs. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Effective hydraulic fracturing is a key issue for successful shale play development and exploitation. This challenge demands characterization of appropriate rock mechanical properties. The concept of rock “fracability”, referred as a material property that determines the capability for fracturing the rock during a stimulation operation, has become one of the main drivers to select sweet spots in a given unconventional formation. This property not only controls hydraulic fracture initiating and propagating pressure, but also affects the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) which determines well productivity.[1]
Several parameters such as brittleness, plasticity and toughness, among others, are frequently referred in the literature to describe rock fracability. The different brittle indexes (B*) proposed by several authors, which are calculated using other rock mechanical properties as the Young<U+00B4>s modulus (E), Poisson<U+00B4>s ratio (<U+03BD>) among others, are good examples of this. |","Document Type

Recently conducted small (laboratory) scale experiments with fluid injection in unconsolidated sand packs revealed various patterns of fluid flow. Some of these patterns depart from that commonly discussed in literature. The experiments have been conducted in a pressure chamber under true-triaxial confining stresses with two types of sand packs: (a) homogeneous and isotropic; and (b) a layered, transverse-isotropic sand pack with fluid injection into a thin sand layer between two weakly permeable or impermeable confining layers. Tests were designed to investigate how fluid injections below and above the minimum confining stress affect the flow behavior in the sand pack and injectivity. Under matrix injection conditions (i.e., injection pressure below minimum confining stress), the initial sand pack structure is practically undisturbed. Under fracture injection conditions (i.e., injection pressure above the minimum confining stress) using a clear low viscosity fluid a heterogeneous and/or anisotropic fluid flow pattern is observed in both types of sand pack. Heterogeneous fluid flow in such cases is associated with the formation of large scale perturbations of the initially homogeneous sand packing in the regions adjacent to the wellbore. Under fracture injection conditions using a solids-laden fluid, a very different fluid flow pattern results. Specifically, highly localized fluid flow pattern through narrow crack-like openings is created in the sand pack, where the ‘cracks’ have a clear filter cake on their surface. This paper briefly reports various test conditions and their corresponding fluid flow patterns, discusses the underlying physics, and outlines a mathematical model of the observed fluid flow through unconsolidated sand under matrix and fracturing conditions.
1. INTRODUCTION
Water injection is widely used for enhancing the transport of hydrocarbons in waterflooding operations, for restoring depleted reservoir pressure, as well as disposing of waste water. A high rate injection is usually required to achieve the objectives of waterflooding. Loss of injectivity can be a significant problem in some unconsolidated sand formations. Understanding the root cause(s) and the development of a predictive model of such phenomena are required for solution of the problem.|","Document Type

Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) are extracted through solution mining at Eti Soda’s Beypazari trona deposits in Turkey. Eti Soda will drill nineteen vertical wells and ten directional wells to develop ten new caverns, with an average depth of about 450 meters (m). This paper discusses methodology for evaluating stability of surface and production casings for the new wells during solution mining. The methods used for this study include: 1) numerical modeling and 2) the method prescribed by the American Petroleum Institute/International Organization for Standardization (API/ISO). The API/ISO method is more suitable for evaluating casing integrity while a casing is being run or shortly after it has been cemented. The numerical modeling method can analyze complicated loading conditions on a casing during solution mining. The numerical modeling method was used as the primary method for evaluation of deformation and stresses of casings for the new wells. The API/ISO method was used as an ancillary method to check the competency of the selected casings based on the modeling results. This study guides the selection of casings for the new wells that have enough strength to withstand most loadings during solution mining without an excessive degree of capacity and durability.

Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) are extracted from multiple trona beds through solution mining at Eti Soda’s Beypazari trona deposits in Turkey. Eti Soda will drill nineteen vertical and ten horizontal wells to develop ten new caverns U6- P045 to U6-P054, as shown in Fig. 1. The depth of cover of these caverns is about 450 m on average. According to the initial well-casing completion plan, 273- millimeter (mm) (10<U+00BE>-inch [in]), 60-kilograms per meter (kg/m) (40.5-pound per foot [ppf]), J55 casing would be used for the 270-meter (m)-long surface casing. For the vertical wells, 178-mm (7-in), 39-kg/m (26-ppf), J55 and P110 were chosen for the upper 250-m and lower 200-m production casings, respectively. For the horizontal wells, 178-mm (7-in), 39-kg/m (26-ppf), J55 would be used for the production casing. |","Document Type

Unexploited underground cavities may represent a potential hazard for the surrounding environment when the occurring consequential instabilities augment and propagate upwards toward the surface causing serious damage. Nowadays, North France and its region face a similar risk where large constructed areas, and due to urban expansion, have been extended to surfaces underlain by shallow cavities. Therefore, it is necessary to anticipate and control the circumstances . This work aims to provide an understanding of the deformational behavior of underground cavities on long term process by carrying out a numerical creep analysis of the failure mechanisms. This is performed based using a coupled constitutive law developed to account for the long term degradation phenomenon of the chalk continuum in the presence of joints. Numerical analysis of the time dependant behavior of the underground cavity considering different joint orientations is performed. In addition to visual inspections which remain the most important for the cavity risk assessment, this approach provides comprehensive elements for a better understanding of the progressive failure and thus the temporal aspect of the deformational behavior and failure of underground cavities. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Natural and anthropogenic underground cavities may represent a potential hazard for the surrounding environment due to consequential instabilities that might end up with serious damage. Particularly, when these cavities are at shallow depths, the risk that the damage reaches the ground surface is increased due to the upward propagation of localized rupture that might happen. North France and its region are nowadays threatened by such a risk where large built-up areas have been developed in zones underlain by unexploited shallow cavities excavated several decades ago in the existing chalk layers. Hence, this contribution aims to analyze by numerical means, the behavior of these underground cavities and the corresponding failure mechanisms, taking into consideration the effect of time. This latter is represented by the presence of induced fractures which might appear in short term or in long term, and degradation of the chalk which is a time dependent behavior.|","Document Type

Accurate estimation of rock mass properties is crucial for performing a realistic Geomechanical stability analyses. This requires detailed geological information on the rock mass and jointing system, as well as, the intact rock strength. The conventional methods for strength measurement require core samples, which are expensive, have a time lag and are time consuming; and maintaining the in-situ condition and sample preparation are arduous tasks. It would be ideal if the strength of the rock could be estimated in the field as an in-situ measurement inside closely spaced boreholes. Estimation of the rock strength by scratching its surface has been reasonably successful. Application of this concept for assessment of rock strength in a borehole has led to development of a borehole strength measurement probe. The results of initial tests for development of such probe are presented and explained in this paper. In this study, four different rock samples have been used in cutting tests by a miniature disc cutter. Measured normal, rolling and side forces are recorded to allow for establishing a relationship between cutting geometry and rock strength. The results show a promising correlation between the average normal force for cutting the rock surface with a customized disc and the UCS/BTS of the rock samples with a reliable coefficient of determination. These outcomes can pave the way for the development of the field borehole probe in subsequent studies. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Estimating rock mass properties are essential input for performing geomechanical stability analysis for any structure that is constructed in rock and availability of geological information is the crucial component of such analysis. One of the important parameters in evaluating the rock mass properties is the intact rock strength. This parameter is usually measured by testing the core samples, obtained from exploration boreholes and are subsequently tested in Geomechanics laboratories. The test results offer limited information about the rock at the few locations for the borings despite all the efforts and costs. However, despite all the efforts made to prepare and test the samples, the results may not necessarily be representative of the behavior of the rock in the field since the test cannot provide the in-situ condition of the ground. The ideal solution is to estimate the rock mass properties in-situ, and inside closely placed drill holes in an underground space. |","Document Type

A bonded particle model was used to study the fracture process zone (FPZ) in three point bending test of notched beams. Five different beam sizes of 20 (height) <U+00D7> 60 (span), 40 <U+00D7> 120, 80 <U+00D7> 240, 160 <U+00D7> 480, and 320 <U+00D7> 960 mm2were tested to investigate the effect of specimen size and material ductility on the length and width of the FPZ at the peak load. The material ductility was controlled by using different slopes for the post-peak behavior of contacts between the circular particles in tension. A statistical approach is proposed to more objectively calculate the width and length of the FPZ. It is shown that the size of FPZ depends on specimen size and material ductility. In particular, the shape of FPZ is affected by the specimen size. Different regression methods are proposed to be able to calculate the length and width of FPZ and the best linear regression method is identified and discussed. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Fracture process zone (FPZ) which is made of micro-cracks and damaged contacts between material grains is a common phenomenon in fracture testing of quasi-brittle materials such as rock and concrete. Physical testing using acoustic emission (AE) and X-ray technics have confirmed the presence of the FPZ in rock, concrete, and asphalt [1,2,3]. While there is agreement on the presence of fracture process zone in the vicinity of a crack tip in quasi-brittle materials, disagreements exist in the literature regarding the size of fracture process zone; it is not clear if size of FPZ can be assumed as an intrinsic material property. Zietlow and Labuz [1] conducted several bending tests on different rocks and studied the evolution of the FPZ by using AE technics. They concluded that size of FPZ varies significantly between different rock types, but the change is small for different beam sizes of the same material. On the other hand, Otsuka and Date [2] physical tests on concrete showed significant change in the size of fracture process zone of concrete as the specimen size was modified. |","Document Type

This paper addresses the issue of stick-slip instabilities experienced by drag bit-equipped rotary drilling systems operating at large depths. In particular, on the basis of a simple model of the drillstring combined to an advanced bit/rock interface law, it is shown by way of a case study that a critical rotation speed exists. This critical speed separates two unstable dynamical regimes. Above it, instabilities grow on a slow timescale as compared to the resonant period of the torsional pendulum modeling the drilling apparatus. Below it, instabilities grow on a fast timescale. Accordingly, the model is more prone to nonlinear instabilities such as torsional stick-slip oscillations when operated at rotation speeds below the critical speed than it is above it.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rotary drilling systems are known to experience instability regimes of various natures, e.g., bit bouncing or bit whirling, that are detrimental to the drilling performance and tool life. In this paper, we focus on another type of instability: stick-slip oscillations. In particular, we revisit the stability analysis of the discrete model proposed by Richard et al. [1] to study the self-excited torsional and axial vibrations of deep drilling systems.
Specific to the model is the definition of the drilling action as the sum of two components, one representing fragmentation and excavation of rocks by the bit cutters, the other a frictional contact process taking place on the cutter wearflats. As a direct consequence of the bit rotary motion, the cutting process, which is a function of the height of the rock ridge in front of the cutters, introduces a so-called regenerative effect in the model governing equations that are therefore of the retarded differential equation type with a discrete state-dependent delay.|","Document Type

Increasing mining productivity is a goal to be achieved in many different ways, employing talents, techniques, and standards from many different areas, both divisional and geographical. The high quality backfill at Barrick’s Turquoise Ridge Mine (TRJV) has presented the opportunity to test the potential to optimize the dimensions of drifts mining below backfill. Other mines in Nevada have successfully mined entire levels using an optimized mining sequence that employs the use of 30’ wide undercuts beneath a cemented rock fill sill. The average Rock Mass Rating of the rock mass at TRJV is about 40% less than that of other mines in the areas implementing the same undercut dimensions. Given this situation, the question of increasing the undercut dimensions has been raised and backed with enthusiasm. The problems that may be faced are both operational and geotechnical, and have presented the opportunity to cooperate between departments around the mine site. These undercuts are planned to be mined in March of 2015. This paper will cover the analyses undertaken to determine the viability of mining these undercuts.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture (TRJV) underground mine is located about 50 km (30 mi) northeast from Winnemucca, NV, USA, at the foot of the Osgood Mountains. The ore body at TRJV is highly disseminated over a large area and gold is extracted using underhand cut and fill (UHCF) mining in order to gain the highest possible ore recovery. The rock in these ore bodies is of exceptionally poor quality (RMR 20-35) and requires the implementation of a highly competent backfill. TRJV has been involved in several studies involving backfill in the past decade, namely a study in 2007 involving NIOSH (National Institute of Occupational Safely) as the primary researchers. This study involved successfully instrumenting and mining a 13.7 m (45’) wide undercut below a 4.6 m (15’) thick layer of backfill. This particular study will differ from the previous in that the wide spans will be left open for an extended period of time. This drift will eventually be implemented as a tire shop. There will be two 30’ wide undercuts that will be separated by a 20’ wide backfill pillar. This pillar will be monitored for stability as it is mined and for long term stability after this area is abandoned. The previous 45’ wide span was opened up in an area with relatively high RMR values under a singular 15’ tall backfill sill above. The location of the 30’ wide cuts at the center of this study are located in the High Grade Bullion (HGB) zone of the mine, located approximately 2200’ from ground surface. Mining these 30’ wide cuts will mark the first time in the history of TRJV that a 30’ wide cut will be implemented in to the normal mining cycle in a highly active mining zone.|","Document Type

This paper presents results of three models simulating the hydrological-mechanical behavior of a CO2 injection reservoir and the resulting effects on wellbore system (cement and casing) and seal repair materials. A critical aspect of designing effective wellbore seal repair materials is predicting thermo-mechanical perturbations that can compromise seal integrity. Three distinct computational models comprise the current modeling effort. The first model depicts bench-top experiments of an integrated seal system in an idealized scaled wellbore mock-up being used to test candidate seal repair materials. This model will be used to gain an understanding of the wellbore microannulus compressibility and permeability. The second is a field scale model that uses the stratigraphy, material properties, and injection history from a pilot CO2 injection operation to develop stress-strain histories for wellbore locations from 100 to 400 meters from an injection well. The results from these models are used as input to a more detailed model of a wellbore system. The 3D wellbore model examines the impacts of various loading scenarios on a wellbore system . The results from these models will be used to estimate the necessary thermal-mechanical properties needed for a successful repair material. 
1. INTRODUCTION
A critical aspect of designing effective wellbore seal repair materials is predicting thermo-mechanical perturbations in local stress that can compromise seal integrity. For applications associated with CO2 sequestration, the stress-strain history of abandoned wells, as well as changes in local pressure, stress, and temperature conditions that accompany carbon dioxide injection or brine extraction are of interest. Building on existing thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) finite element modeling of wellbore casings subject to significant tensile and shear loads, we have been developing advancements to a conceptual and numerical methodology to assess responses of annulus cement and casing. The experimental component utilizes bench-top experiments of an integrated seal system in an idealized scaled wellbore mock-up to test candidate seal repair materials [1, 2]. These bench-top experiments have been modeled with bench-scale numerical models to identify and evaluate the essential hydrologic and mechanical properties of the candidate sealants. Field scale models using the stratigraphy from a pilot CO2 injection operation can be used to estimate the necessary mechanical properties needed for a successful repair material [2, 3].|","Document Type

This paper proposes a two-dimensional (2D), time-dependent, and tightly coupled computational algorithm for hydraulic fracturing simulations. It uses the cubic law model for computing the fluid flow in opened fractures and fluid volume caged inside the fractures. A finite element method (FEM) is used to evaluate stresses and deformation of elastic rock blocks. The Lagrange multipliers method is used to prevent penetration during contact between adjacent rock blocks while imposing fracture tip displacement constraint conditions. The propagation criterion of hydraulically induced fractures is imposed by mixed mode stress intensity factor, which is calculated using a displacement correlation method. This scheme is also coupled with tensile and shearfailure models to describe natural fracture evolution and its interaction with approaching hydraulically induced fractures. The geomechanics and fluid dynamics common components naturally lead to a tightly coupled integrative system, where its unknowns are rock block corner displacements, the Lagrange multipliers in case blocks in contact or displacement constraints applied, and fluid pressure at junctions of opened fractures. The proposed algorithm solves for all unknowns simultaneously and in a tightly coupled manner, while the general Newton algorithm is implemented for solving the overall nonlinear system of equations at each time step.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing treatments in horizontal wells are used to produce unconventional formations, such as tight gas sands and gas shale [1]. Although hydraulic fracturing technology has been used practically for some time, the associated numerical simulations still pose some crucial challenges. A basic review of relevant hydraulic fracturing aspects is provided [2]. Most geomechanics models used are based on single-fracture geometry and some analytical solutions, such as the PKN [3] and KGD [4] models. However, pre-existing natural fractures in unconventional reservoirs contribute more uncertainties during the fracturing process in terms of propagation of hydraulic fractures and the interaction between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures. The interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures could generate a complex fracture network (CFN) other than simple fracture geometries.|","Document Type

L., Rockfield Software Limited| Dutko, M., Rockfield Software Limited| Yu, J., Rockfield Software Limited","|Abstract
Hydraulic fracturing in tight gas reservoirs is a complex physical process with interactions between fracking fluid flow in a confined channel, fracture propagation in reaction to an initial and evolving stress state, proppant transport inside an advancing fracture and finally gas production over the life-time of the well. This paper outlines the modelling methodology of a combined Finite Element (FE) and Discrete Element (DE) technology which is used in the software package ELFEN to simulate hydraulic fracturing. Current FE/DE technologies require a fine mesh in the region of the advancing tip to satisfactorily capture stress concentrations. The developments are centred on the capability to simulate fracture propagation within a geometry fracture insertion rather than element splitting framework. A local remeshing scheme is adopted instead of a traditional global remeshing procedure in which a fine mesh is maintained only adjacent to fracture tips to readily cut down on computational cost. The newly developed technology is demonstrated on simulating fluid driven fractures in single and multiple stimulated wells.
1. INTRODUCTION
In light of the recent commercial interest in the hydraulic stimulation of unconventional reservoirs, the key processes involved have received much attention in the scientific community. The hydraulic fracturing process has been employed to enhance the production of oil and gas from underground reservoirs [1]. Hydraulic stimulation is a particularly energy and resource intensive operation. A typical frack pump will be rated from 700 to 2700 hydraulic horsepower [2]. A single stage hydraulic fracturing treatment can consist of 4.2 million gallons of slickwater [3]. The injected proppant amount varies from about 36,000 to over 140,000 kg per stage [4]. With these enormous numbers it is imperative to enhance the hydraulic stimulation process to reduce both the amount of energy and resources used. Modelling approaches tied closer to a better understanding of the physical processes offer a robust framework in which to move forward.|","Document Type

N., Sandia National Laboratories","|Abstract
Microannuli that develop along the cement-casing interface have been identified as common leakage pathways in wellbores. We have developed an experimental system that allows laboratory testing of wellbore specimens which are comprised of a cement sheath cast on a steel casing. Specimens were produced with a range of flaws including microannuli between the steel casing and the cement. The system allows independent application of confining pressures to 35 MPa and casing pressures to 20 MPa while gas flow is measured through the specimens along the wellbore axis. We present the gas flow results in terms of the hydraulic aperture of microannuli as a function of confining pressure and internal pressure for two different types of microannuli. Hydraulic apertures decrease non-linearly with increasing stress across the microannuli in a manner similar to fractures in rocks and other materials. The hydraulic apertures are more sensitive to changes in confining pressure than casing pressure, consistent with the estimated contact stress that develops across the cement-casing interface. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The integrity of wellbore systems - consisting of casing, cement sheath and adjacent rock formation – is of critical importance to many sub-surface operations including CO2 sequestration, oil and gas exploration and production, and geothermal energy development. Wellbore systems can have a significant vertical permeability due to the presence of flaws (factures, voids) that allow for fluid migration along the axis of the wellbore [e.g., 1]. The cement-casing interface, herein referred to as the microannulus, has been identified as a common leakage pathway [2, 3, 4]. The flaws are created by a range of factors during well cementing and subsequent well operations, including incomplete drilling mud removal prior to cementing, cement shrinkage, and changes in pressures and temperatures within the casing [5].|","Document Type

It is critical to understand the dynamic tensile failure of rocks subjected to pre-tension for rock engineering applications such as underground mining and tunneling. A modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system is applied to load Brazilian disc (BD) samples statically, and then exert dynamic load to the sample through a stress wave generated by impact. The pulse shaper technique is used to generate a slowly rising stress wave to facilitate the stress equilibrium of samples. Five groups of Laurentian granite BD samples (with tensile strength of 12.8 MPa) under the pre-tension of 0 MPa, 2 MPa, 4 MPa, 8 MPa, and 10 MPa were tested under different loading rates. The results show that the rock dynamic tensile strength decreases with the increase of the pre-tension. It is also observed that under the same pre-tension, the dynamic tensile strength increases with the loading rate. However, the total tensile strength of the rock is roughly independent of the pre-tension. The failure patterns of the samples also reveal the rate dependence of the dynamic strength of rocks. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Tensile failure is a main failure mode of rocks in underground projects, in which rocks are subjected to dynamic disturbances while under in situ stresses. As is well known, pores and microcracks are potential sources of failure for rock materials because of stress concentration [1-3]. When disturbed by dynamic loads from blasting, seismicity, or rockbursts, the underground rocks would be vulnerable to tensile failure. Even though the far-field load is compressive, the local stresses may be tensile as shown in Fig. 1. From a macroscopic point of view, the bending of the roof induces tensile stress at the roof of the opening; from a microscopic view, the discontinuities in the rock result in tensile stress locally. On top of these pre-tension, dynamic disturbance may be tensile in nature and lead to the ultimate failure of the rock material. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the dynamic tensile failure of rock materials under pre-tension.|","Document Type

The design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment typically requires using a computational model that provides rapid results. One such possibility is to use the so-called classical pseudo-3D (P3D) model with symmetric stress barriers. Unfortunately, the original P3D model is unable to capture effects associated with fracture toughness in the lateral direction due to the fact that the assumption of plane-strain (or local) elasticity is used. On the other hand, a recently developed enhanced P3D model utilizes full elastic interactions and is capable of incorporating either toughness or viscous regimes of propagation by using the corresponding asymptotic solution at the tip element. Since either the viscous or toughness asymptote is used, the intermediate regime is not described accurately. To deal with this problem, this study aims to implement the intermediate asymptotic solution into the enhanced P3D model. To assess the level of accuracy, the results are compared to a reference solution. The latter reference solution is calculated numerically using a fully planar hydraulic fracturing simulator (Implicit Level Set Algorithm (ILSA)), which also incorporates the asymptotic solution for tip elements that captures the transition from viscous to toughness regime.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing (HF) plays a crucial role in the petroleum industry, as it allows one to perform reservoir stimulation and intensify hydrocarbon production [1]. To design a HF treatment, an appropriate HF model needs to be utilized. The simplest model is the onedimensional Khristianovich-Zheltov-Geertsma-De Klerk (KGD) model [2], in which the fracture propagates in a plane, the elastic interactions are modelled assuming that plane strain conditions prevail, and the coupling between viscous fluid flow and elasticity is included. To represent the fracture geometry more realistically, the Perkins-Kern- Nordgren (PKN) model [3, 4] was developed to predict fracture propagation in a horizontally layered medium. The PKN model assumes that the fracture height is always equal to the thickness of the reservoir layer, the fracture opening in each vertical cross-section is taken to be elliptic, while the fluid pressure is calculated assuming that a plane strain condition holds in each cross-section. Given the fact that the PKN model does not allow for the height growth, the pseudo-3D (P3D) model, which permits height growth, has been developed [5]. Later, with the increase of the computational power, more accurate planar 3D models (PL3D) were developed [7, 8]. As follows from the name, the fracture is contained in one plane, where the fracture geometry within this plane is discretized using a two-dimensional grid. Since the KGD, PKN and P3D are essentially one-dimensional models, while all varieties of PL3D are two-dimensional, the CPU time increases dramatically. The PL3D models improve accuracy and open the possibility of capturing different fracture geometries. Recently, researchers have shifted their effort to investigate the interaction between multiple hydraulic fractures that are growing simultaneously [9], and to describe non-planar fracture propagation [10]. |","Document Type

In this study, we numerically simulated thermal pressurization of a fault and investigated temperature and pore pressure changes during seismic slip. Thermal pressurization of fault fluid during slip tends to reduce frictional resistance by increasing pore pressure along the fault. We used a coupled Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical finite element model to simulate thermal pressurization by implementing a simple constitutive law to couple pore pressure changes with temperature rise due to frictional heating. The effects of hydraulic diffusivity and slipping zone thickness on pore pressure and temperature changes were investigated. The parametric study results showed that the weakening rate increases by decreasing the slipping zone thickness. Lower hydraulic diffusivity was shown to induce larger reduction in the effective normal stress.
1. INTRODUCTION
Once fault slip is initiated, two mechanisms with opposite impacts compete to control slip and rate of slip (Segall & Bradley, 2012). Shear-induced dilatancy of the fault core tends to increase fault permeability and consequently, to decrease fluid pressure. In contrary, fault heating inclines to increase fluid pressure and to weaken the fault (Rice 2006, Segal and Bradly 2012). An earthquake occurs if the thermal weakening process during the fault’s early slip takes over the shear-induced dilatency due to the release of tectonic stress (Wibberley & Shimamoto, 2005). Two thermal mechanisms, referred to as flash heating and thermal pressurization, can weaken the fault and decrease frictional resistance along the fault (J. R. Rice, 2006).
Flash heating occurs in rapid slips and mostly depends on the slip rate (Rice 2006). This mechanism deals with highly stressed micro-scale contacts during slip and decreases the fault friction coefficient. The real contact area (i.e., slip surface) is the sum of contact areas of all the asperities which is a small fraction of the macroscopic contact area. Since the stress supported by the asperities is larger than the stress carried by the fault surface, sliding leads to a large heat production and weakening of the contact (Rice, 1999; Tullis & Goldsby, 2003; Prakash, 2004; Rice, 2006; Beeler et al., 2008).|","Document Type

Fluid-pressure-driven (or hydraulic) fracturing of rocks is used in several applications including stimulation of unconventional reservoirs, permeability enhancement of geothermal systems, and rock mass pre-conditioning in deep mining. In recent years, there has been a fast growing interest in the development and use of advanced numerical methods to better describe hydraulic fracturing processes. In this paper, recent advances in hydraulic fracturing modeling using a three-dimensional hybrid finite-discrete element (FDEM) code are presented. FDEM is an explicit numerical method which combines continuum mechanics principles with discrete element algorithms to simulate multiple interacting deformable fracturable solids. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by simulating two cases of fracture nucleation and growth around a pressurized cylindrical cavity in a homogeneous and isotropic medium. Realistic emergent pressure response and fracture patterns are obtained with the simulated fracture networks highlighting a distinctive 3D interaction of individual fractures around the location of injection. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Fluid-pressure-driven (or hydraulic) fracturing is used in several engineering applications, including stimulation of low-permeability oil and gas reservoirs, permeability enhancement of hot dry geothermal systems, and rock mass pre-conditioning in deep mines. Although the process of fluid-pressure-driven fracturing in geomaterials is generally well understood, its quantitative description is still a largely open research topic due to physical complexities and geological uncertainties. In particular, the mechanics of hydraulic fracturing involves complex, non-linear, hydro-mechanical processes occurring on different length scales in a three-dimensional space. One of the main research areas in this field is represented by the development of new simulation tools capable of capturing an increasing number of physical processes with a higher level of detail and with minimal assumptions regarding the problem dimensionality. The goal of this paper is to present the latest advances in the 3D simulation of pressure-induced fracturing processes in brittle rocks using a numerical approach based on a hybrid finite-discrete element method (FDEM).|","Document Type

Coal mine bumps are a serious safety problem in coal mines and they are very hard to predict due to the poor understanding of the exact mechanics of this dynamic failure phenomena. However, previous research has demonstrated that the local mine stiffness (LMS) criterion is a promising approach for analyzing the possibility of violent pillar failure. Typically, the local mine stiffness calculation quantifies the loading stiffness of the surrounding rock mass and compares that to the stiffness of the support pillars in the post-failure range in order to determine if a pillar failure in the mine will occur in a stable or un-stable manner. If the loading stiffness is softer than the support stiffness, a dynamic failure can occur. With this knowledge ahead of time, mine engineers can modify the geometries and pillar sizes in the mine design to help eliminate violent pillar failure.
In this paper, the principles of the LMS criterion for evaluating stable versus unstable failure are reviewed. Then the mathematical techniques used to implement a LMS calculation into LaModel are presented. Next, a simple idealized model is used to demonstrate and quantify the effects of rock mass stiffness and mine geometry on the LMS calculated by LaModel. Then, an actual coal mine, pillar bump accident is back analyzed with the LaModel code with the recently implemented local mine stiffness calculation. The numerical model was initially calibrated to thoroughly match the observed mine failure, and then the local mine stiffness and post-failure pillar stiffness were calculated and compared. In this mine model, the mine stiffness steadily decreased to eventually match the pillar stiffness at the time of the observed violent failure. This case study demonstrated that the local mine stiffness criteria can be successfully calculated and applied, but the accuracy of the calculation is very dependent on accurate rock mass and pillar properties. 
1. OVERVIEW 
Pillar bumps are a longstanding ground control problem associated with coal mining. This kind of pillar failure has presented serious safety problems in the United States throughout the 20th century [1, 2]. In order to attack the problem of bumps, the local mine stiffness stability criterion has been recognized as a reasonable analysis approach and it provides a means to distinguish if the pillar will fail in a stable or unstable manner [3, 4]. 
Although this theoretical criterion has been well established for a long time, there are still significant gaps in our ability to accurately evaluate the stability of pillars with it due to the challenges of accurately determining the post-failure pillar stiffness and the local mine stiffness in a mining layout [2].|","Document Type

In this contribution, we analyze in detail the spatio-temporal changes of the stress field caused by fluid injection and their effects on injection induced seismicity. We use linear superpositions to model a cylindrical injection source in a three dimensional poroelastic medium of infinite extent that mimics an open borehole section rather than a single point source. The influence on induced seismicity is monitored via changes in the Coulomb failure function. Previous theoretical and numerical studies indicate that injection induced stresses have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect depending on relative position with respect to injection point and principal stress directions prior to injection. Consequently the shape of seismic event clouds is affected by pore pressure diffusion and induced stresses. 
Our results indicate that poroelastic induced stress has a direct impact on the triggering front of seismicity. In particular during shut-in we find a significantly different position of the triggering front compared to predictions from pore pressure diffusion models. The calculated three dimensional seismic event clouds are in good agreement with field observations.
Our findings emphasize the importance of poroelastic stress changes in addition to pore pressure diffusion effects in describing and analyzing injection induced seismicity.
1. OVERVIEW 
Traditional analysis of injection-induced seismicity assumes pore pressure diffusion to be the main triggering mechanism [1,2]. Recent contributions however also emphasize the importance of induced poroelastic stress for the spatial evolution of the triggering front. Schoenball [3] investigated the influence of poroelastic stress compared to anisotropic diffusivity. The authors used a two-dimensional numerical model and found that either mechanism results in similar elongated microseismic clouds, rendering the two effects indistinguishable. Altmann [4] extended the analysis to three dimensions and concluded that fault reactivation is promoted along the maximum principal stress direction through poroelastic stress contribution. Field studies indeed reveal that seismic event clouds may be elongated along the maximum principal stress direction [5,6,7].|","Document Type

Sand production in gas reservoirs is often associated with severe erosion of topside installations, due to high velocity impact of sand grains on tubing bends and choke restrictions. Dedicated laboratory testing on various field and outcrop sandstone specimens surprisingly show that sand production onset is delayed relative to oil or brine flow through the same rocks. This delay is observed even when care is taken to match the drag force on the sand grains to that observed in tests with liquid flow. One proposed explanation is that desiccation of the sandstone occurs, due to the expansion of the gas as it emerges into the borehole; drying of many sandstones is accompanied with an increase in strength, which may be responsible for the observed sand onset delay. Another hypothesis is that non-linear gas flow in the porous rock results in losses due to acceleration and deceleration from pore to pore, such that only part of the flow energy is translated into drag force on the grains. Careful analysis of the laboratory tests seems to confirm the latter hypothesis. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Gas reservoirs are often produced with high rates in wells and topside pipes [1]. For weak sandstone formations, this entails the risk that any sand particles co-produced with the gas also have high velocities. Such high velocity sand grains cause extensive erosion damage, especially in bends and when passing through choke restrictions [2]. This erosion propensity explains the widespread practice in the oil and gas industry of restricting gas production rates so as to avoid any risk of sand production. On the other hand, accurate prediction of the conditions for sand onset, in terms of allowable drawdown to the wells and depletion of in-situ pressure in the reservoir, is vital in order to preserve the economic interests, i.e. maximizing fluid productivity. Even if no sand management approach is adopted [3], a closer investigation of sand rate evolution after sand onset is still needed, so as to better quantify the needed safety factor when designing well production throughout expected operation lifetime. |","Document Type

Crack initiation, propagation and coalescence, from pre-cracked rock specimens, were detected in the laboratory using elastic wave transmission and reflection signals. The experiments were conducted on prismatic Indiana limestone specimens with two parallel pre-existing flaws subjected to uniaxial compression. Digital image correlation was used to monitor the cracking process around the tips of the flaws by imaging surface displacements. Compressional and shear wave pulses were transmitted and reflected continuously through the specimen while the uniaxial compressive load increased. The normalized amplitude of transmitted waves (shear waves with horizontal polarization) was observed to decrease with increasing uniaxial load, which was associated with the elastic deformations of the specimen. However, prior to tensile crack initiation, a large reduction in amplitude occurred. In addition, an additional decrease in amplitude was observed close to crack coalescence. These changes in amplitude occurred at least 1.3 MPa before the detection of damage by DIC imaging. The normalized amplitude of reflected signals (from the flaw tips) also increased significantly before the initiation of new cracks. These experimental results indicate that changes in transmitted and reflected seismic waves provide a potential method to detect crack initiation inside rock, as well as to determine the location of new cracks.
1. OVERVIEW 
A large number of experimental studies have been conducted on crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence in pre-cracked brittle materials. In most of these studies, the pre-existing crack (flaw) has been subjected to mixed mode loading (mode I: opening or tensile and mode II: in plane shear) [1–11]. Two types of cracks have been observed in these experiments: tensile (wing) and shear (secondary) cracks, which are shown in Fig. 1. Tensile cracks initiate at or near the tip of the flaw. They propagate toward the direction of maximum compression and they are stable (i.e. further propagation of these cracks require application of additional load). These cracks are also characterized by a plumose structure on their surface. Shear cracks initiate from the tips of the flaws, they are initially stable, but they may be unstable close to crack coalescence or specimen failure. These cracks have been classified into two groups: coplanar or quasi-coplanar (making an angle of 45° or less with the flaw plane) and oblique (with an initiation angle larger than 45° with the flaw plane). The shear cracks are formed in areas of high compression and/or shear stress. They are characterized by pulverized material on the surface and by high roughness [12]. Park and Bobet [12] performed laboratory uniaxial compression tests on gypsum specimens with two, three, and 16 parallel flaws. They identified eight types of coalescence based on different flaw geometries (see Table 1 in [12]). Observations in the laboratory have relied on visual inspection using optical magnification and high-speed cameras. While these techniques have been instrumental in the understanding of cracking phenomena at the macroscopic scale, what is needed, is a local or microscopic characterization of new cracks forming inside the brittle materials.|","Document Type

Shale gas is an unconventional fossil energy resource that is already having a profound impact on US energy independence and is projected to last for at least 100 years. Production of methane and other hydrocarbons from low permeability shale involves hydrofracturing of rock, establishing fracture connectivity, and multiphase fluid-flow and reaction processes all of which are poorly understood. The result is inefficient extraction with many environmental concerns. This work uses innovative high-pressure microfluidic and triaxial core flood experiments on shale to explore fracture-permeability relations and the extraction of hydrocarbon. These data are integrated with simulations including lattice Boltzmann modeling of pore-scale processes, finiteelement/ discrete element models of fracture development in the near-well environment, and discrete-fracture network modeling of the reservoir. The ultimate goal is to make the necessary measurements to develop models that can be used to determine the reservoir operating conditions necessary to gain a degree of control over fracture generation and fluid flow.
1. INTRODUCTION
Shale gas is an unconventional fossil energy resource that is already having a profound impact on US energy sector, with reserves projected to last for nearly 100 years [1]. The increased availability of shale gas (i.e., methane), which produces 50% less CO2 than coal, is primarily responsible for US emissions in 2011 dropping to their lowest levels in 20 years [2]. Production of methane and other hydrocarbons from low permeability shale involves hydrofracturing of rock, establishing fracture connectivity, and multiphase fluid-flow and reaction processes, all of which are poorly understood. The result is inefficient extraction with many environmental concerns [3,4]. Industry is motivated to reduce the 70 to 140 billion gallon per year water demand because there are droughts in the west, a lack of deep injection wells in the east, and possible forthcoming regulations [3]. Our goal is to use unique Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) microfluidic and triaxial core flood experiments integrated with stateof- the-art numerical simulation to reveal the fundamental dynamics of fracture-fluid interactions to transform fracking from an ad hoc tool to a safe and predictable approach based on solid scientific understanding. The goal is to develop CO2-based fracturing fluids and fracturing techniques to enhance production, reduce waste-water, while simultaneously sequestering CO2 [4]. |","Document Type

Present study investigates applicability, superiorities and impediments of point estimate methods (PEM) in probabilistic stability analysis of rock slopes. A rock slope which involves correlated non-normally distributed variables, is considered and probabilistic analyses are carried out incorporating four different PEMs with numerical method. It is illustrated that correlation and asymmetry in random variables can be treated in different ways by using different PEMs. Some methods like Rosenblueth’s or Zhou & Nowak’s PEMs are originally applicable for correlated skewed random parameters while deficiencies of Harr’s and Hong’s PEMs arise when random variables are non-normally distributed and correlated, respectively. It is shown that how can manipulate these two methods in order to make them usable for correlated non-normal variables.
1. Introduction
Having considered the recent works which have been done by [1-9] in recent two decades, it can be said that probabilistic analyses are increasingly becoming popular in geotechnical engineering in order to take uncertainties into account where stability of geotechnical structures are investigated. When these analyses are performed using numerical methods, it is vital to select an appropriate probabilistic tool that not only can readily be incorporated with numerical method, but also makes the analyses efficient. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) [10], reliability methods and point estimate method (PEM) [11] are some probabilistic tools which are widely used in geotechnical engineering. In case that model evaluation is time consuming, MCS is infeasible because small number of simulations leads to inaccurate results and on the other hand, large number of simulations leads to inefficiency. FORM [12] and SORM [13] need to calculate derivatives of performance function with respect to random parameters; as a result, these methods may not easily be combined with numerical methods. Under such circumstances, PEMs often constitute more practical alternatives as they require smaller amount of computations along with statistical moments for inputs only. In this research, the applicability of PEMs in analyzing the stability of a rock slope probabilistically, is investigated. |","Document Type

China is the world's largest coal-producing country and its coal production was 3.57 billion ton in 2014, of which underground longwall mining accounts for more than 85%. China has achieved great progress in ground control of underground mining. Many theories are well applied to coal mining, such as the “voussoir beam” theory for analyzing the roof breaking law and shield support capacity, the “key strata” theory for controlling the surface subsidence, the dynamic load theory for determining supports capacity in large-cutting-height mining and top-coal caving mining and the coal wall shear failure theory for high strength mining. The maximum capacity of self-developed two-leg and four-leg shield support reaches 21000KN, which realized the strata control of working face in large-scale mining. The backfilling mining technique for controlling surface subsidence is basically mature. Strengthen the research on ground control theory of extremely-thick coal seam mining, gob-side entry retaining technique in top-coal caving mining, multiple coal seams mining and deep coal seam mining are the main directions of future development of ground control theory and technique in China's coal mine.
1. INTRODUCTION
Since 2010, China has become the largest energy consumption country in the world with a total of 38.52 billion tons, accounting for 22.4% of the world's total energy consumption. Coal accounts for 76% of energy consumption in China [1]. China’s coal production reached 3.66 billion tons in 2013, however, it decreased by 2.5 percent in 2014 than the amount in 2013, which is the first negative growth of China's coal production since 2000. Nevertheless, China's coal production accounts for about 48 percent of world coal production, of which 85 percent comes from underground mining, so underground mining plays an important role in China. Nowadays fully mechanized longwall mining has become the main method for underground coal mining in China, but there are some differences on the specific mining method because of the influence of coal seam thickness, inclination and many other factors.|","Document Type

We studied the initiation and propagation of mode II fractures in granite and sandstone under confining pressure to investigate the controls on shear fracture propagation in rocks. An asymmetric loading set up was used to induce a fracture in cylindrical rock samples under confining pressure between 0-20 MPa. We achieved quasi-static fracture propagation with a refined AE feedback displacement control. This technique prolongs the fracturing process up to 42 hours, provides a higher AE resolution and thereby allowed the distinction of two different stages in shear fracture propagation. Granitic samples form vertical fractures in the strain strengthening stage that branch and stop propagating at peak stress. Simultaneously at peak stress a distinct diagonal fracture nucleates on the loaded side of the vertical fracture. During strain weakening we observed stable growth of this second diagonal fracture until the sample lost its integrity. On the other hand sandstone samples only form the diagonal fracture during the strain weakening stage. Analysis of AE source type and hypocenter as well as microstructural analysis indicate that porosity, either intrinsic (sandstone) or deformation inflicted (granite), primarily influences this fracture nucleation and propagation behavior for both rock types. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Fractures form as microscopic cracks coalesce into a planar structure, which can be captured by monitoring acoustic emissions (AEs). Macroscopically, rocks will fracture in the mode (I or II) corresponding to the mode of loading determined by the orientation of the fracture relative to the stress state. However at a microscopic scale, both modes of fracturing can be found in what may appear to be a pure mode of fracturing at the macroscopic scale [1, 2]. According to the acoustic emissions observed during rock fracturing experiments, shear-, tensile-, and compression-events all occur during macroscopic mode II fracture propagation [3]. On a microscopic scale on the other hand, increased confining pressure suppresses the occurrence of mode I fractures and supports the occurrence of mode II fractures [4]. These observations demonstrate the complexity of rock fracturing on a microscopic scale and thereby raised a controversy about the validity of macroscopic fracture modes. The existence of a fracture criterion for mode II is still debated in the literature [5, 6]. To study this, many authors used acoustic emissions to stabilize the fracture process [1, 7, 8, 9, 10]. By controlling the load in response to the intensity of the observed AEs, the rate of fracturing was varied and fracture propagation could be visualized in detail. |","Document Type

A release of energy occurs during mining-related seismic events such as rock bursts and coal bumps. The magnitude of these events depends partly upon the energy made available by the loading system and partly upon the post-peak softening behavior of the failing medium. In addition, the extent of unstable failure and associated release of energy can be affected by slip along interfaces between dissimilar materials. This paper compares the results of two numerical models from the back analysis of a coal mine collapse which resulted in a 3.9 local magnitude seismic event. Release of kinetic energy is considered in the simulations, which were run using a 2D distinct element software package. The model inputs differ in that the interfaces between the coal and the surrounding rock are defined either through Coulomb slip joint parameters or continuously yielding (displacement-softening) joint parameters. The geometry, loading conditions, and mining sequence are otherwise identical. The coal is modeled as a strain-softening material, while the roof and floor are modeled as continuous elastic blocks. The failure response and magnitude of released energy are compared between the two models. The results of the analysis indicate that the softening coal/rock interface facilitates the collapse of large width-to-height ratio pillars and leads to a release of energy more than one order of magnitude higher than the alternative coal-rock interface.
1. INTRODUCTION
The unstable failure of coal pillars, especially those with large width-to-height (w/h) ratios, involves a great deal of complexity. Although large w/h pillars exhibit hardening behavior under loading and are prone to fail gradually, the combination of certain loading conditions and geologic properties can result in sudden collapse. The nature and extent of such failures depends on many factors, including the geometry of the mine and the presence of stiff overlying strata. Another factor that has a significant effect on the behavior of the pillars is the strength, or rather weakness, of the interface between the coal and the host rock. There is little data available regarding the properties of coal/rock interfaces, but a number of studies have been conducted to better understand the effect that they have on pillar strength [1], [2], [3], and [4]. This paper presents the results of two mine-scale numerical models in which a pillar retreat mine fails unstably, and although the modeling procedures are identical in each simulation, the application of different coal/rock interface parameters results in a different progression and magnitude of failure.|","Document Type

The paper presents numerical modeling of experimental scale study of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation for creation of Enhanced Geothermal Systems. The displacement discontinuity method, which is a variant of the boundary element method, is used to model the rock matrix deformation and stress distribution around the fracture surface. Parabolic crack tip elements are used to account for square root variation of the fracture front displacement and stresses. Newtonian fracturing fluid flow is modeled using the standard Galerkin’s Finite Element Method. The fracture initiation and propagation process are addressed following the linear elastic fracture mechanics. The hydraulic fracture simulation process presents a complex numerical problem in which physical processes involved such as rock matrix deformation, fracture fluid flow, and fracture propagation are interdependent. The fracture aperture strongly influences the fluid flow behavior inside the fracture, as the fluid velocity is a function of the fracture aperture, and the fluid pressure influences rock deformation process. Hence, these processes of the fluid flow, the fracture deformation, and the fracture propagation are solved in a coupled manner using sequential iterative approach till the convergence is achieved. First, details of the mathematical model and methodology are presented. The model is then tested against some known analytical and semi-analytical solutions. Finally, the hydraulic fracturing results from a true triaxial EGS experimental cell developed at Colorado School of Mines are used to validate numerical model results.

Hydraulic fracturing is considered the primary means of creating functional geothermal reservoirs at sites where the permeability of rock is too limited to allow cost effective heat recovery. The natural and hydraulically created fractures provide conductive paths to the stored hydrocarbons or thermal energy in the reservoir rocks to the wellbore thereby increasing the production rates. Stimulation technology and methodology as used in the oil and gas industry for sedimentary formations are well developed; however, they have not sufficiently been demonstrated for the Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) reservoir creation. Insufficient data and measurements under geothermal conditions make it difficult to directly translate experience from the oil and gas industries to EGS applications. Creation of the EGS reservoirs requires an improved fracturing methodology, rheologically controllable fracturing fluids, and temperature hardened proppants. |","Document Type

Triaxial tests are performed on sandstone of an ultradeep well in Tarim Basin at high temperature 160°C and room temperature using GCTS RTR-1500 triaxial rock testing system. Sandstone’s full stress-strain curves under different experimental conditions are plotted, and a modified Duncan model is proposed based on experiment and theory. A simple analytic treatment of compressible gas flows in porous media is used to forecast the gas flowing pressure distribution. The compressive strength under room temperature is given via the logging data. The Hoek-Brown criterion is used for sandstone failure. It is shown that the temperature has a significant impact on elastic modulus of sandstone, but doesn’t affect Poisson ratio of sandstone. The modified Duncan model can predict the peak of the stress-strain curve of the sandstone. It is given that the variation of the compressive strength with the temperature. A field case verified that the proposed wellbore stability model could predict the safety pressure drawdown for an ultra-deep gas well during well test 
1. INTRODUCTION
With the increasing demand for oil and gas worldwide due to emerging economies, oil and gas explorations are moving to more harsh environments, with more wells being drilled under high pressure and high temperature conditions. The initial reservoir equilibrium pressure in an ultradeep gas well can reach 100MPa or higher. As the high pressure gas in an ultradeep gas well moves toward the wellbore, it experiences increasing expansion and this expansion reaches a maximum at the exit to the wellbore. Expansion-induced gas acceleration can significantly impact the pressure distribution near the wellbore [1-4]. The properties of rock mechanics is summarized for different kinds of rock under high temperature [5-8]. Heuze et al [5] summarized the properties of the granite mechanics at high temperature. The effects of confining pressure and temperature on the granite mechanics was given by Lau et al [6]. Bayer and Welte [7] gave the effect of temperature on rock mechanical properties in source rocks via triaxial compression test. Using the computer simulation methods, Teich-McGoldrick et al [8] gave the effect of temperature on rock mechanical properties in mirrorstone rocks. |","Document Type

The lattice bond cell (LBC) is a newly developed lattice model for dynamic fracture simulation. It represents a rock with a discrete structure composed of lattice bond cells. Each lattice bond cell can take any geometry with any number of bonds. The interactions between particles in a cell are characterized by an interatomic potential. In this study, the LBC is used to simulate dynamic hydraulic fracture. A special technique is developed to impose fluid pressure to fracture faces. The simulation examples suggest that the LBC can simulate the initiation, propagation and branching behaviors of fracture driven by the internal high fluid pressure without any separate fracture criterion. The fracture branching behavior is analyzed. The branching degree of hydraulic fracture is governed by the fluid pressure level while the branched fracture growth direction is governed by the ratio of in-situ stress. It is suggested that the LBC is a feasible approach to simulating dynamic hydraulic fracture.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracture (HF) is an important technique to stimulate oil production in the unconventional reservoir. So far many methods have been developed to simulate HF process. However, most of them focus on the quasistatic HF while few on the dynamic ones. In reality, some hydraulic fractures branch due to the internal high fluid pressure. Branching is a kind of unstable fracture response to rapid loading. It cannot be captured by the static simulation method. Hence, it is necessary to develop an effective method to simulate the dynamic HF. The dynamic HF is different from the usual dynamic fracture in that it is driven by the internal fluid pressure. The pressure boundary condition varies as the fracture develops. Thus, the dynamic HF behavior becomes more complicated. In the dynamic fracture simulation, the discrete element method presents obvious advantages over the continuous one. It has been extensively used to simulate the quasi-static HF, e.g. Torres and Castano [1] and Marina et al [2], but few to the dynamic HF. Recently, Zhang[3] has developed a lattice bond cell method to model the continuum. This lattice bond cell method is different from the conventional lattice method in that its discrete structure is composed of lattice bond cells. Each lattice bond cell can take any geometry and can have any number of bonds. A hyperelastic interatomic potential is introduced to describe the interactions between particles. This makes the lattice bond cell method quite suitable to simulate the dynamic fracture for the hyperelasticity governs the instability of dynamic fracture[4, 5]. In this paper, the lattice bond cell model is used to simulate the dynamic HF. Due to the complicated variable pressure boundary condition, the fracture direction is subjected to many factors. Da Silva and Einstein[6] have studied the fracture initiation and possible propagation direction of HF under quasi-static load. Zhang and Chen[7] suggests that the dynamic re- HF always tends to develop along the maximum in-situ stress direction. But in these researches, no dynamic fracture branching behavior is involved. If the HF is subjected to the dynamic fluid pressure, the fracture propagation direction becomes more complicated. The dynamic HF simulation becomes especially important to determine the HF direction. |","Document Type

New Gold’s New Afton Mine (“New Afton”) is a 5 million tonne per year operating block cave mine located 8km outside of Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. The current extraction level is at 615m below surface and the current mining footprint is approximately 800m in length by 120m in width. At its current size, New Afton is one of the smallest producing block caving operations in the world. The ore being mined is a copper-gold porphyry deposit situated within the Iron Mask batholith complex, is bounded by 2 major fault structures and dips near vertically to the south-southeast and plunges southwest. The bulk of the economically viable portion of the deposit is highly jointed and rockmass quality is in the order of 35 - 55 (RMR76, Bieniawski), placing it in a poor to fair classification category. The case study presented here focuses on a single strike drive (“G”) located on the southern abutment of the cave. An excavation that has been subjected to numerous rehabilitation operations and campaigns since caving started early in 2012. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The New Afton Mine completed its first drawbell in September 2011. This was after ~17,700 metres of decline access, infrastructure and footprint development. The operation decided on the “El-Teniente” extraction leve l layout of straight-through drawpoint drives, a decision largely made on geotechnical and operational considerations. Employing an advanced undercut method, a fairly aggressive drawbell development and construction schedule was planned and achieved to establish the initial design hydraulic radius to promote steady state caving. This caving strategy allowed the operation to install a number of convergence monitoring stations throughout the entire advanced strike drive development ahead of the cave. This important aspect provided us the ability to monitor ground movement very early on and track progression of rockmass deformation and changes as the cave matured |","Document Type

This fact is accredited to the fast progresses obtained in hydraulic fracturing and pad drilling technologies. The contribution of shale rock surface desorption to production is widely accepted and confirmed by the industry experts often observed through laboratory and field evidences. Nevertheless, the subsequent changes in porosity and permeability due to methane desorption combined with hydraulic fracture closures due increased net effective rock stress state, have not been captured in current shale gas modeling and simulation. Hence, it is very critical to investigate the effects of induced permeability, porosity, and stress by methane desorption on gas production. |We have developed a numerical model to study the effect of changes in porosity, permeability and compaction on four major U.S. shale formations considering their Langmuir isotherm desorption behavior. These resources include; Marcellus, New Albany, Barnett and Haynesville shales. First, we introduced a model that is a physical transport of single-phase gas flow in shale porous rock. Later, the governing equations are implemented into a one-dimensional numerical model and solved using a fully implicit solution method. It is found that the natural gas production is substantially affected by desorption-induced porosity\permeability changes and geomechanics. This paper provides valuable insights into accurate modeling of unconventional reservoirs and consequently leads to a significant change in future production predictions which might enormously contribute to the U.S. economy. |1. INTRODUCTION |Recoverable reserves of shale gas in the U.S. are estimated to be 862 Tcf [1]. Although challenges associated to exploration and management of shale assets are yet to be resolved, decreased evaluated risk promises a secure gas supply for next decades. The large accumulation of gas shale formations might serve as both a hydrocarbon source and a productive reservoir. Most of the gas is stored in organic-rich rock while a minor fraction of gas in place is in pore spaces [2]. Extremely low matrix permeability as well as highly complex network of natural fractures are challenging characteristics of shale formations. Permeability of shale rocks is estimated to be between 50 nD (nano-Darcy) to 150 nD [3]. Recent advances and innovations in hydraulic fracturing are key success of shale gas economic production as a viable global energy supply. Nevertheless, complexities associated with flow mechanisms and existence of many pressure dependent phenomena, such as combined hydraulic and natural fracture conductivity losses, Klinkenberg gas slippage effect, desorption/adsorption and Darcy/non-Darcy flow, are not yet completely understood and need more extensive studies and modeling in order to meet our industry needs.

Hydraulic fracture growth is simulated in homogeneous granite with a fully coupled hydromechanical discreteelement method. Three models are considered, namely an intact rock and two models with pre-existing fractures, connected or disconnected to the incipient hydraulic fracture plane. In all scenarios, the hydraulic fracture grows in a plane with a mostly circular front, despite anisotropic stresses. In the intact rock and disconnected models a hydraulic fracture propagates normal to the minimum principal stress, whereas in the connected fracture model fluid leaks into a pre-existing low dipping fracture set. The length of the hydraulic fracture increases with the square root of time and the maximum aperture is linearly correlated to the length of the fracture, except for the connected fracture model, where the aperture is limited and mostly constant over time. These results demonstrate the important role pre-existing natural fractures can have on hydraulic fracture growth. Stress perturbation due to the developing hydraulic fracture promotes fracturing at the fracture tip but inhibits failure in the fracture walls. In the connected fracture model these stress perturbations are significantly reduced, due to fluids moving into the natural fractures. 
1. INTRODUCTION|Hydraulic fractures are fluid-induced and connected hydraulically to the injection well. They form a more or less complex geometry with an architecture ranging from a simple planar structure to a complex fractured zone [3, 4, 5, 6]. The volume of the hydraulic fractures commonly increases over the course of the fluid injection indicating fracture propagation and linkage [7]. Hydraulic fractures commonly grow normal to the minimal principal stress [8, 9]. It is therefore interpreted as resulting of tensile opening due to increased pore pressure at fracture tips and in the fracture volume [10, 11, 12]. However, evidence of shearing has also been highlighted [3, 8, 13, 14]. |","Document Type

Rock brittleness is an indicator to characterize the intensity of failure, widely used in shale hydraulic fracturing for reservoir stimulation and tunnel construction. Representative measurement approaches of brittleness are reviewed. A brittleness determination method comprised of rock physics techniques and mechanical tests is proposed for dry samples of shale, sand, limestone and concrete. The samples are tested with ultrasonic pulse under hydrostatic pressure. Triaxial tests of samples are carried out under various confining pressure with constant temperature, recording stress-strain relations and AE (acoustic emission) signals originated from macro rock damage. The SEM (scanning electron microscope) image of failure shale samples show cracks of brittle failure in rock matrix under test load. The method for brittleness determination is presented with comprehensive consideration of pre-peak damage and post-peak strength release rate based on stress-strain relationship. It appears that the method, which revealed intrinsic brittleness of intact samples and failure under artificial load, appropriately characterizes brittle behavior of rock with matrix damage. The brittleness is independent of mineral composition alone. Shale samples are far more brittle than other samples used for tests. The shale and sand samples in various confining pressure show more brittle behavior in moderate confining pressure. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock brittleness is an indicator to characterize the intensity of failure, widely used in unconventional reservoir hydraulic fracturing for stimulation consideration. However, even up to now the definition of brittleness varies from authors to authors and areas to areas [1-8]. At present, it’s widely accepted that the pursuit for one universal brittleness determination method is laborious and fruitless, as specific assessment methods are required to serve in sorts of practice. |","Document Type

The Bakken Formation is an extremely tight formation with low porosity and permeability. Activity in developing such an unconventional play has increased due to the success of horizontal drilling coupled with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing stimulation. However, due to high capillary trapping the primary recovery factor in the Bakken remains rather low. Therefore, small improvements in productivity of Bakken wells by applying enhanced oil recovery could increase the recoverable oil by billions of barrels. Among several EOR options, CO2 flooding may be effective to increase the recovery factor. In this paper, numerical simulation is used to evaluate the performance of CO2–EOR for the Bakken Formation. There is also a strong interest in coupling reservoir fluid flow with geomechanics to study the stress and deformation of reservoir rock thoroughly. In this work we used coupled code to study the interactions between reservoir flow and geomechanics to model the deformations and stresses in a CO2-EOR process.
1. INTRODUCTION
Gas injection is an effective enhanced oil recovery method in naturally fractured or hydraulically fractured tight formations. Recent studies showed that CO2-EOR could be a viable method to increase recovery in tight shale plays. The Bakken reservoir of Williston Basin is one of such tight plays composed of an upper shale member, a middle member of sandstone and siltstone, and a lower shale member. Activity in developing the Bakken Formation has increased due to the success of horizontal drilling coupled with multistage hydraulic fracturing stimulation [1]. However, maintaining production— which may be acquired by hydraulic fracturing and well stimulation— is quite challenging for this type of wells. Hence, the primary recovery factor in the Bakken Fm remains very low estimated less than 10% of the original oil in place [2- 5].|","Document Type

In this paper, we describe efforts to create a computationally efficient model that is accurate for multiple, three dimensional fracture problems. The accuracy of a fast pseudo-3D method (Olson, 2004) for describing fracture interaction is investigated through comparing with a fully 3D displacement discontinuity method (DDM). Results demonstrate that the pseudo- 3D solution underestimates the mechanical interaction between nearby fractures. The apertures of both interior and exterior fractures given by the pseudo-3D method are larger than the fully 3D solutions. However, 3D DDM is computationally far more expensive than the pseudo-3D method because a) more elements are required to describe a fracture in three dimensions and b) the computational cost per element is higher in 3D. We show that using 1 element in the fracture height direction with the standard 3D equations is unacceptably inaccurate, but by employing an analytically based correction factor, that accuracy can be significantly improved, eliminating the need for extra elements for height-contained hydraulic fracture problems. The higher per element computation cost in 3D is largely the result of the fact that the 3D displacement discontinuity method has three unknowns (opening, strike-slip shear and dip-slip shear). Further speed advantage is gained by dictating all fractures must be vertical, which allows elimination of equation components related to the dip-slip shear. We demonstrate how this model can be applied to problems of multiple hydraulic fracture propagation in horizontal wells. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, production of tight oil and shale gas has increased exponentially in the United States. Multiple fracture treatments in horizontal wellbores are becoming a prevalent approach to economically develop unconventional reservoirs. A better understanding of multiple fracture growth is essential for accurately predicting fracture geometry. Mechanical interaction between multiple fractures, also referred to as stress shadow effects, is a critical factor controlling fracture geometry and inducing complex fracture geometry. To better model fracture interaction, an efficient and accuracy method is required. |","Document Type

Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) jet can break rocks with higher rates and lower threshold pressures than water jet due to the unique fluid properties. The abrasive SC-CO2 jet technique, which is formed by adding abrasive particles to the SC-CO2 jet, was proposed and studied. It is expected to achieve better cutting performance than water jet and SC-CO2 jet. Considering the low fluid viscosity, whether the SC-CO2 jet has satisfactory particle carrying capacity has to be determined. In effort to investigate the motion of the abrasive particle and the feasibility of abrasive SC-CO2 jet, numerical simulations on the flow field of the jet under different ambient conditions were carried out, as well as the comparisons with another three particle-laden jets. The results show that SC-CO2 jet has better particle carrying capacity than the other three fluids. Moreover, temperature rise slightly impairs the capacity meanwhile both the fluid and particle velocities increase, exerting better impinging effect of the abrasive jet. Besides, SC-CO2 jet can fully carry particles with the diameter in the range of 0.1~2.4mm to form the abrasive SC-CO2 jet. Particles with larger diameter will obtain higher impinging velocity on the impinged target. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Inman [1] pointed out that the large-scale, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, coupled with horizontal drilling, has led to a boom of the development of the shale gas in the US and may help achieve “a thriving US economy” in the future. However, Hughes [2] assumed that it will also bring difficulties like sustainability, high cost, water contamination and other environmental concerns and so forth. Likewise, according to EIA [3], shale gas industries in China in early stages of development are facing both technical and water resource challenges, in addition to the difficult terrain and high overall costs. Considering the huge consumption and exploration of natural gas worldwide, Wang et al [4] thought that it is in urgent need to make progresses in operating fluids. According to Rogala et al [5], emphasis has been placed on the alternatives to hydraulic fracturing or the non-aqueous fracturing technologies due to its technical and environmental advantages. Among the fluids, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) is hopeful to replace water as a drilling fluid or the abrasive-laden fluid in hydraulic fracturing in shale gas development.|","Document Type

Numerical simulation is the main method to predict and manage petroleum reservoirs, in which, traditionally, rock compressibility, that cannot well represent stress-strain behavior of the rock, is the only geomechanical parameter taken into account. Considering this, a more complete representation of rock mechanical behavior is a key point for any hydromechanical numerical analysis, starting with rock mechanics and petrophysical lab experiments, followed by numerical calibration. In this work Modified Drucker-Prager and Mohr-Coulomb constitutive models have been adopted for numerical modeling of rock mechanics experiments on different carbonate types. Hydromechanical behavior has also been numerically assessed for some of the tested samples, aiming for the construction of a pore pressure – porosity – permeability variation table, which allowed the use of pseudo-coupling. In this way, geomechanical effects were taken to reservoir simulation, obtaining a good relation between computational cost and accuracy.
1. INTRODUCTION
The main method to predict and manage petroleum reservoirs is numerical simulation in which, traditionally, rock compressibility is the only geomechanical parameter taken into account. During exploitation, though, reservoir-rock deforms, causing porosity and permeability variation, phenomenon that cannot be represented by compressibility. Considering this, a more complete representation of rock stress-strain behavior is a key point for any hydromechanical numerical analysis. A good mechanical characterization of a geomaterial based on rock mechanics and petrophysical lab experiments is a starting point, followed by numerical calibration of rock behavior observed in laboratory. This last stage can be done via lab experiments modelling, aiming to obtain mechanical and elastic parameters that best represent the stress-strain rock behavior, based on a proper constitutive model.
This paper intends to describe a methodology based on numerical modeling of lab experiments to take to reservoir simulation the geomechanical effects due to exploitation. For this, three examples of numerical modelling of experiments, and one example of pseudocoupling application are presented, all based on carbonate rock data.|","Document Type

Acoustic emission (AE) analyses have been used for decades for rock mechanics testing, but because AE systems are not typically calibrated, the absolute sizes of dynamic microcrack growth and other physical processes responsible for the generation of AEs are poorly constrained. We describe a calibration technique for the AE recording system as a whole (transducers + amplifiers + digitizers + sample + loading frame) that uses the impact of a 4.76 mm free-falling steel ball bearing as a reference source. We demonstrate the technique on a 76 mm diameter cylinder of westerly granite loaded in a triaxial deformation apparatus at 40 MPa confining pressure. In this case, the ball bearing is dropped inside a cavity within the sample while inside the pressure vessel. We compare this reference source to conventional AEs generated during shear loading of a saw-cut simulated fault in a second granite sample at confining pressures up to 120 MPa. All located AEs occur on the saw-cut surface and have moment magnitudes ranging from M -5.7 down to at least M -8. Dynamic events that rupture the entire simulated fault surface (stick-slip events) have measurable stress drop and macroscopic slip, and radiate seismic waves similar to those from a M -3.5 earthquake. The largest AE events that do not rupture the entire fault are M -5.7. For these events, we also estimate the corner frequency (200- 300 kHz), and we assume the Brune earthquake source model to estimate source dimensions of 4-6 mm. These AE sources are larger than the 0.2 mm grain size and smaller than the 76 <U+00D7> 152 mm fault surface. Finally, we compare our results to other calibrated AE studies performed on different loading machines and discuss reasons for the observed maximum AE magnitude.
1. INTRODUCTION
Acoustic emissions (AEs) are tiny seismic events thought to be caused by microcracking or slip instability on the grain scale. They are sometimes recorded during rock mechanics experiments to monitor fracture and faulting processes [1]. In slow loading experiments on rock samples containing pre-existing artificial faults, AEs tend to cluster around stick-slip instabilities (dynamic events that involve slip of the entire fault surface) in a manner reminiscent of foreshocks and aftershocks. It has long been assumed that AEs are in some sense small-scale versions of earthquakes and that they can provide insights into earthquake mechanics [2- 5]. Yet, while earthquakes are routinely quantified by their seismic moment, only rarely is the absolute size of an AE determined. This is because AE recording systems are not typically calibrated.|","Document Type

Experimental investigations on the long-term recompaction behavior of damaged rock salt itself and in interaction with the sealing system, under partial or near-full brine saturation, are performed. Rock salt samples for the experiments are taken from the vicinity of an existing dam that has been loaded in situ by the creeping rock salt for more than 10 years. The interaction with sealing materials is simulated by using hollow cylinders of salt equipped with a central concrete seal in isostatic cells. The focus of the work is on a systematic investigation of the material behavior leading to EDZ recompaction. It should result in a set of material parameters needed to treat the process in a numerical way.
1. INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the German ministry for economics and energy (Bundesministerium fuer Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi), GRS performs application-oriented safety research related to radioactive waste management in Germany. Among others, GRS is investigating sealing and backfilling materials planned to be utilized in a repository in a salt formation.
The German safety requirements for a repository of heatgenerating nuclear waste [1] comprise several safety principles, the most important ones being:
• Radionuclides and other contaminants in the waste must be concentrated and contained in a containment-providing rock zone (CRZ) and thus be isolated from the biosphere as long as possible.• Waste disposal must ensure that release of radionuclides from the repository enhances only insignificantly the risks resulting from natural radiation exposure.
A robust barrier system is required to ensure that the safety principles are met.|","Document Type

This study focuses on analyzing thermal effects produced by plasma torch on rock physical parameters, designed to assist operations during geothermal well drilling. Plasma torch can interact with samples and reduce rock strength. In the presented theoretical model it is noticed that elasticity modulus (Young’s modulus) and temperatures play important roles in thermal stress distribution. The results show that at 4500°C with 6MPa compressive loading elasticity modulus is the best situation for wellbore instability. By contrast, at 1500°C with a loading of 38MPa elasticity modulus is a suitable result for stability of the borehole. In experimental work it is found that 7 to 10 seconds plasma torch traction with cylindrical specimen rock samples can generate thermal fractures. Elasticity modulus of all granite and limestone samples was sharply dropped after 10 seconds of plasma torch interaction with each dry rock sample on account of the fact that visible cracks generate on the surface.
1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, problems associated with drilling oil and gas wells around large urban settlements have become a major limitation to underground drilling, particularly in relation to environmental damages in highly populated or industrialized areas. Therefore, the development of underground drilling mechanisms is of high priority [1- 6]. Hard-rock drilling is an expensive process because the drill string machines and bottom hole assembly must be extremely rugged and powerful to overcome the intact hard rocks [3-10]. We present a method to assist improving hard rock drilling machines, which is achieved by developing techniques to weaken the rock before it is mechanically removed [9-12]. This is obtained by generating uniform holes inside of rock textures during drilling and perforation operation [10- 13]. Recently it has been reported that making of holes inside the intact rocks may not be a suitable method [9- 12]. It is proposed that a proper method to change the hard rock into a loss rock can be achieved by generating fractures into the rock texture [10-13]. The fractures can be generated by generating a high temperature gradient within the rock. Temperature increase causes expansion and eventually breakdown. One way to induce a proper temperature gradient is by using the plasma torch in order to assist the drilling operation. During thermally assisted drilling operation fractures are generated inside of the wellbore and this can reduce the wall strength considerably [19-20]. A plasma arc torch can generate that temperature into the rock and material texture [30- 34].|","Document Type

"234","2015-212","A Practical Log-Based Approach on Assessing and Preventing Wellbore Instability Considering Both Mechanical and Shale Swelling Effects","Likrama, Fatmir, Halliburton| Diaz, Arturo, Halliburton","|Abstract
Various techniques and drilling practices have been developed to remedy drilling problems owing to shale swelling; however, a quantitative estimation of shale swelling potential has been difficult to establish in the oilfield. The cation exchange capacity is one parameter that has been shown to control the swelling of shales both qualitatively and quantitatively. A correlation derived from basic physical principles for the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of shale formations using common log data of temperature, resistivity, and sonic slowness has been modified using available core and cuttings test data. Cation exchange capacity is then used to distinguish problematic, smectite-rich shale formations from the trouble-free, illite-rich formations using a threshold value. An empirical relationship that involves calculated values of CEC and thresholds is then developed to estimate the osmotic pressure resulting from an imbalance of water activities—in effect, estimating a higher mud weight needed to stabilize the well. This methodology was applied to a well drilled in the North Sea combined with mechanical wellbore-stability analysis and shows good agreement with wellbore enlargement and well events. The technique has multi-fold benefits, including identifying problematic drilling intervals owing to the abundance of smectite, estimating the minimum mud weight necessary to prevent drilling problems owing to shale swelling, and ultimately determining whether a well is drillable with a water-based mud system.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wellbore instability is a challenge when drilling through shale formations with a water-based mud. Shale instability may lead to stuck pipe, shale sloughing, and a low-quality or even a lost wellbore. Causes of wellbore instability in shales may be separated into two main categories—mechanical and chemical.
Mechanical wellbore instability in shales results from mechanical failure of weak rock formations owing to stresses in the vicinity of the wellbore. Shear failure along weak bedding planes—an example of strength anisotropy that often afflicts shale formations—also falls into this category.|","Document Type

In recent years, the number of new and planned gas storage caverns has increased, so that optimization of the existing salt deposits and especially the question of the minimum allowable distance between the cavern and the salt dome boundaries became important. Although caverns were built in the salt dome boundaries in recent years, however, no dimensioning concept was previously published worldwide.
This paper deals with creating a concept for rock mechanical dimensioning of gas storage caverns in the salt dome edge area. Within this dimensioning concept it has to be demonstrated that caverns can be operated gas tight and stable in this location. The analysis of the formation of salt deposits and possibilities of exploration of a salt dome represents an important basis for the model buildup and evaluation of a cavern in the salt dome edge region.
A numerical model was created that takes into account the essential and non-negligible influences in the salt dome edge area. Furthermore time-dependent, thermo-mechanical coupled numerical calculations were carried out. The influences of different model variations were analyzed regarding the cavern surrounding stress state.
Based on the calculation results, the effects of varying the parameters on the cavern surrounding stress state were discussed and assessed. Here, the dimensioning parameters maximum and minimum internal pressures as well as the pressure change rates of the cavern were analyzed for a cavern in salt dome edge region. An important role for the evaluation of the stress state of the cavern in the salt dome edge region plays the stress intensity index of the rock salt.
Within this paper a dimensioning concept is shown which includes beneath the recommendation for the selection of a suitable calculation model of a cavern in the border region of a salt dome a dimensioning parameter as a recommendation for the minimum distance between the cavern wall and the salt dome boundary.
1. INTRODUCTION
In Germany salt caverns are used to store liquid and gaseous energy sources like natural gas and crude oil for over 40 years. As part of the increased demand for fossil fuels, the incipient liberalization of the gas market and the changing usage with respect to the operation of the cavern storage facilities numerous new caverns were planned at various locations in Germany and leached in recent years.|","Document Type

A modified numerical model has been used in optimizing the drilling performance and field integrity in Vaca Muerta Formation of the Neuquen Basin of Argentina. In-situ stress analysis provided a steadily oriented stress tensor and principal stress magnitudes consistent with the normal fault stress regime that was confirmed with drilling and well log data. An integrated wellbore-integrity study was conducted to solve instabilities including stuck pipe and tight holes encountered during drilling operations at the offset wells, to optimize future drilling procedures, to maximize the drilling margin for the prospective wells, and to reduce drilling risks. The geomechanical model was coupled with in-situ stress and formation property anisotropies, temperature alteration, shale-fluid physico-chemical interactions, and the flow-induced stress using Mohr-Coulomb and Mogi-Coulomb failure criteria. The well trajectory, drilling-fluid density and types of water-based muds were confirmed to have a dominant impact on the occurrence of instabilities experienced while drilling and completion. Core data, imaging and sonic scanner logs along with conventional log data were utilized to obtain in-situ stress magnitudes, orientations and formation properties. The stochastic risk and sensitivity analysis were performed using thirteen well data to evaluate the sensitivity of the input data on the study outcome. Results show that higher mud weight is expected to minimize wellbore instabilities. Results of the wellbore integrity analysis presented in this study will benefit the remediation and/or prevention of wellbore instabilities for improving economic viability and sustainability of the field development in Vaca Muerta Formation.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Vaca Muerta Formation is lithologically associated with the Late Jurassic calcareous and silicoclastic mixed shale that was deposited along the northwestern part of the Argentinean Patagonia in the Neuquen Basin (Fig. 1). It is a lithostratigraphic unit that can be easily recognized in outcrops as organic-rich marls (Fig. 2). The composing sedimentary architecture corresponds to a distal facies of a mixed carbonate sequence developed between the Jurassic Tithonian and Valanginian ages. This highly prolific source rock was deposited during the Tithonian (Late Jurassic) transgression that took place in the Neuquen Basin that rapidly flooded the underlying Eolian and fluvial units of the Tordillo Formation (Kimmeridgian). This transgression marks the maximum basin expansion of the marine environment that extended for about 30,000 km2[1].|","Document Type

The objectives of the InSpEE research project are the development and deployment of design principles and basic geological/geotechnical data and of site selection criteria for the establishment of salt caverns as well as the estimation of the renewable energy storage potentials of the salt structures in the North German Basin. Cooperating InSpEE project partners are the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), Leibniz University of Hanover, Institute of Geotechnical Engineering/Department of Underground Construction (IGtH) and KBB Underground Technologies GmbH (KBB UT) bringing in their expertise in the areas of salt geology and rock mechanics. Besides systematic collection and evaluation of geological information about salt deposits in North-West Germany thermo–mechanically based assessment criteria will be applied for the site characterization and estimate of its possible storage potential.
At the end of the three-year project period, a publicly accessible “Salt information system” will be provided and in addition, the storage potential for caverns as well as for hydrogen (H2) and compressed air (CAES) in Northern Germany shall be addressed. Within this paper the rock mechanical design for CAES and H2 storage in salt caverns under consideration of thermo-mechanical coupled calculations will be presented.
1. INTRODUCTION
In Germany, there is consensus in government and industry that caverns in rock salt are going to be used in the future for the storage of renewable energies. The compressed air storage is available for short-term applications, while hydrogen storage plays a role more suitable for long-term applications. The goal of the currently ongoing research project is therefore to develop and provide design bases and geological basic data and criteria for site selection for the construction of salt caverns for the storage of hydrogen and compressed air. On this basis, estimation will be developed of the energy storage potential of Northern German salt structures for renewable energy. For a long time caverns in rock salt mainly were used to store crude oil and natural gas to offset seasonal fluctuations [1]. In recent years, the requirements have changed, however, with the liberalization of the gas market. Modern trading storages require much more flexible storage options, which make particular by balancing short-term fluctuations in demand high requirements on the stress of the surrounding rock salt caverns. Transferability to different requirements of salt caverns for the storage of compressed air and hydrogen, however, is still open. The published operating experience of Europe's only cavern storage power plant in the Huntorf salt dome is not sufficient to quantitatively understand the interaction between rock salt and compressed air and to transfer lessons learned to other caverns with different boundary conditions.|","Document Type

We implemented the object-based method using marked point processes to generate a natural fracture network honoring an assumed fracture characteristics’ distribution where the fractures are two-dimensional zero-thickness circular disks. Fractures are divided into two groups based on their alignment which is acquired by Monte Carlo sampling from two Gaussian distributions with 90-degree shift in the mean value; this hypothesis is validated considering the frequently observed checker-board fracture patterns in the outcrops. The growth of the fractures in the second group or the secondary (daughter) fractures can be terminated by a criterion derived from the distribution of the fractures in the first group or the primary (parent) fractures. For data assimilation purposes, a smooth seismic distribution for fracture density is mimicked by simple krigging which inherently possesses a smoothing nature. Then, the generated seismic data is honored by revising the fracture distribution such that in areas with less fracture density we have fewer fractures. This work provides a novel, yet easy and fast workflow to stochastically model a natural fracture network following the attributes offered by seismic data and concludes an orthogonal or bidirectional fracture pattern. This pattern can be easily extended for multi-directional fracture patterns using the proposed framework.
1. INTRODUCTION|One of the big concerns in fractured reservoirs characterization is the representation of the subsurface fractures due to large uncertainty and extremely limited direct measurements pertaining to exact spatial distribution of fractures.

The use of slurry impoundments has traditionally been the primary method of disposal of fine waste slurry resulting from the recovery of fine coal from coal preparation plants. However, disposal of coal waste has become challenging with stringent regulations for surface disposal facilities. The process of backfilling of mine void space is called slurry backfilling. This method would eliminate environmental, health, and safety risks associated with the surface disposal facilities such as impoundment failure due to ground motion, subsidence, etc. Although slurry backfilling has significant advantages, it may raise some mine stability concerns. As the floor or pillars of the mine are exposed to moisture, they may soften and lose strength. In this study, the slurry backfilling effect on stability of two Illinois underground coal mines is investigated. The mine floor consists of non-durable claystone material with various thicknesses. The geotechnical and geological information of the mine will be analyzed. The stability of these mines will be evaluated using empirical and numerical methods considering the softening of floor beds and pillars with slurry.
1. INTRODUCTION
Based on the estimation of the Illinois State Geological Survey, about 330,000 unit houses are exposed to the dangers of surface subsidence [1]. Consequently, stability of mines has been one of the main concerns in Illinois which should be professionally and practically addressed. The stability of mines deteriorates when exposed to moisture. On the other hand, due to more stringent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations slurry backfilling of mines as one of alternatives for disposing fine coal waste has attracted more attention. Slurry backfilling consists of pumping coal fine refuse to abandoned space. Slurry backfilling of coal waste can remove environmental, social, and health problems [2]. In light of many case studies by different researchers and committees such as Griffith and Connor [3], on different mines, hydraulic backfilling has been recommended. However, some studies show that slurry backfilling does not work well for all types of mines. For example, in the Donovan study [4] this method has been recommended only for thin-seam coal mines.|","Document Type

Shale, like many other sedimentary rocks, is typically heterogeneous and anisotropic with partial alignment of anisotropic clay minerals and naturally formed bedding planes. A numerical method based on the lattice discrete particle model was formulated. Material anisotropy is introduced through an approximated geometric description of shale internal structure and a representation of material properties variation. Calibration was performed by comparing the numerical simulation results with experimental data. A series of simulated experiments, including elastic analysis, Brazilian tensile test and unconfined compression test, were demonstrated. Simulation results shows that the dependence of tested strength and failure modes on sample orientation can be captured successfully. This work will pave the way for the development of reliable hydraulic fracturing models that appropriately account for the mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous and anisotropic shale. 
1. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth of the shale gas/oil industry, especially the development of hydraulic fracturing technique, the study to promote deep understanding of the mechanical properties of shale-like rocks is becoming more important. Gas/Oil shale, described as organic rich and fine grained [1], exhibit significant mechanical anisotropy and heterogeneity due to the organized distribution of platy clay minerals and compliant organic materials [2]. Developing adequate numerical models to capture the heterogeneity and anisotropy of shale leads to a better understanding of the influence of material properties on induced fracture initiation, propagation and fracturing treatment, and therefore provides a powerful tool to predict and optimize the fracturing process. 
In a broader sense, the available numerical methods can be classified into continuum- and discontinuum- based methods [3,4]. The continuum approaches, such as finite element method (FEM), finite difference method (FDM) and boundary element method (BEM), treats the computational domain as a single continuous body and captures material failure behaviors through common techniques such as plastic softening and damage models. As the lack of an internal length scale, the standard continuum approaches cannot capture localization of failure, and manifests itself in mesh sensitivity [3,5]. These shortcomings can be overcame by introducing micro-structural effects with second gradient damage models, non-local models [5] etc. On the contrary, the discontinuum approaches, represented by discrete element method (DEM), treat the materials as an assembly of separate blocks or particles, and is capable of incorporating the length scale automatically. The methods of modeling material anisotropy are often classified into smeared approach and discrete approach [6]. The smeared approach utilizes a smeared representation in which the anisotropy is introduced at the level of constitutive laws by varying material parameters as a function of the relative orientation between elements and the bedding plane orientation [7]. The discrete approach utilizes a discrete representation in which the anisotropy is introduced by a geometric description of layers or joints with varying material parameters [6,8,9]. The discrete approach offers unique advantages when the extended loss of continuity inside the material makes continuum constitutive models inappropriate [6].|","Document Type

All rock excavations by means of natural gravity caving, mechanical excavation or blasting cause redistribution of the static stress and strain in the remaining rock mass. It is critical to measure the change of the strain state. Such a measurement can serve as quantification of the damage and of the effectiveness of a blast design or an excavation method. Secondly, the measurement can be used to monitor slope or mine structure stability to improve the mine safety.
At present, there is no method available to calculate strain changes over a large area of a rock slope or an underground structure. New technologies developed over the last few decades; such as GPS, radar systems, three dimensional photogrammetry and multi-sensor displacement monitoring, are also used nowadays to monitor displacement. If a strain calculation method is developed, the data may be used to calculate distributions of three dimensional strain tensors in the slope or highwall. Without a strain calculation method, the data can only give displacement change at discrete monitoring spots.
This paper presents a method for measuring the change of the static strain state at a remaining rock mass or ground associated with operations of excavations, such as blasts, mechanical means or gravitational caving of a portion of the ground. The method is based on measuring coordinates of selected points with recent accurate survey techniques before and after an excavation. The paper also shows that for small deformation the different reference points for survey before and after an excavation can be used, which provides great convenience in practical measurement.
The calculation of the strain change is done by solving a set of simultaneous equations for the displacement gradients. With the number of survey points larger than the minimum number required, the number of the independent equations is greater than the number of unknowns and minimizes measurement errors. |","Document Type

This paper reports new developments on the complex variables boundary element approach for solving three-dimensional problems of cracks in elastic media. These developments include implementation of higher order polynomial approximations and more efficient analytical techniques for evaluation of integrals. The approach employs planar triangular boundary elements and is based on the integral representations written in a local coordinate system of an element. In-plane components of the fields involved in the representations are separated and arranged in certain complex combinations. The Cauchy- Pompeiu formula is used to reduce the integrals over the element to those over its contour and evaluate the latter integrals analytically. The system of linear algebraic equations to find the unknown boundary displacement discontinuities is set up via collocation. Several illustrative numerical examples involving a single (penny-shaped) crack and multiple (semi-cylindrical) cracks are presented.
1. INTRODUCTION
Accurate three-dimensional modeling of fracture is of key importance for rock mechanics applications such as simulation of mining in faulty rock or computer simulation of hydraulic fracturing. In both applications, the Boundary Element Method (BEM) can serve as an efficient tool for realistic modeling of mechanical deformation of fractured rock. In previous papers [1, 2] we introduced a new approach for solving three-dimensional crack problems. The approach featured the following new elements:
• The use of complex variables to create various combinations of the fields, e.g. in-plane components of tractions, displacement discontinuities, as well as geometric parameters.• The use of triangular elements and analytical integration over those elements. • The use of the “limit after discretization” procedure, i.e. enforcing the boundary conditions after the discretization and analytical handling of the internal fields.
The approach was illustrated in [1] for a simple case of constant approximations of the unknowns. In [2], the method was further extended to include higher order approximations of unknowns. In addition, a new technique is employed to analytically evaluate the involved integrals. It is based on the reduction of the area boundary integrals over an element to those over its contour using complex integral representations. The technique allows for enrichment of the library of boundary elements by including those bounded by combination of straight lines and circular arcs.|","Document Type

Fault reactivation under a given injection pressure is estimated for faults surrounding a well designed for the purpose of drilling cuttings reinjection in offshore West Africa. The poroelasto-plastic finite-element method (FEM) is used to calculate a set of scenarios of injection pressure values under which fault reactivation could occur. Seismic activity related to this fault activation is calculated using an analytical method with the numerical solution of displacement discrepancy across the fault as input. Maximum magnitude of the seismicity induced by this fault reactivation is calculated. The fault being investigated is in the maximum horizontal-stress direction of the field to the injection well. The following assumptions are adopted in the calculation: the pore-pressure boundary condition at the bottom of the fault is determined by the injection pressure, which is given as input data, and the inclination angle is 70°. The FEM being used is a simplified plane-strain model. Numerical results obtained with the FEM model include the distribution of the equivalent plastic strain within the whole model, distribution of the von Mises equivalent stress, and the value of the displacement discrepancy across the fault under the specified pore-pressure boundary conditions at the bottom of the model. The development of the plastic region indicates the status of fault reactivation under injection resulted pressure.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fault reactivation is an engineering problem that can be initiated by the connection of stimulated factures to the fault. Reactivation of a fault could result in environmental pollution owing to fluid migration, particularly in an offshore field. Another environmental risk of injection-related fault reactivation is possibility of induced seismic behavior. Investigations on these topics using different methods have been reported by various researchers since the last decade. To determine a reasonable and accurate solution of fault reactivation and its environmental impacts with minimum cost, it is necessary to briefly review the studies in existing literature.|","Document Type

This paper compares the evolution of the principle stress state associated with buckle folding by studying the deformation process of two different geometries: single-layer and multilayer buckle folds. A 3D finite element modeling approach is applied to simulate the buckle folding of single-layer and multilayer stacks with Maxwell visco-elastic rheology. It is concluded that the stress state within the folding layer(s) are determined by the buckling process, fold geometry and material parameters. This study shows that the presence of the competent layers has a governing influence on the amplification rate of fold amplitude and the evolution of the strain/stress field. The lowest magnitude of effective minimum principle stress is found at the top of the hinge of the bottom competent layer in the three-layer system and central competent layer in the five-layer system. Moreover, layer-parallel extensional strain and low magnitudes of layer-parallel principle stress is observed between the limb and the hinge of the central competent layer in the five-layer system. Little differential stress develops throughout the folding layer in the less competent layer(s). This study also shows that tensile fractures perpendicular and parallel to the fold axis at the hinge and in the limb can be explained by the developed overpressure in low permeability rock. In summary, this study shows that strain distribution and stress evolution within buckle folds are directly dependent on the number of competent layer(s) and the distribution of material parameters. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Fold systems in deformed rock are considered as common structural trap systems for petroleum reservoirs. Understanding the mechanics of folding and associated natural fracture systems is essential for a better understanding of hydrocarbon migration and production [1]. In nature, multilayer folds are more frequent than single-layer folds [2]. The structural development of multilayer systems during buckle fold evolution have been extensively studied by either considering the competent and incompetent layers as separate objects [e.g., 3, 4] or treating the multilayer system as a homogeneous but anisotropic body by applying average properties [e.g., 5-7]. More recent studies have applied different approaches including thin-beam equations [e.g., 3, 8 and 9] and fluid dynamics [e.g. 5, 10-13] to study folding in multilayer system. The observed fold shapes and the tectonic history of multilayer system are found to be dependent on various parameters, such as the amount of bulk shortening [14], layer thickness [12], the rheology [15], the viscosity ratio [16,17], and the type of active folding [2]. Moreover, a detailed analysis on the strain evolution of a two-layer fold system has been performed by using finite strain ellipses and the two layers are found to form parallel folds with changing thickness between them [18].|","Document Type

More and more large-scale underground power houses are under complex geological environment of great buried depth and high in-situ stress. Meanwhile, it is complicated to analyze the long-term stability of underground caverns owing to the existence of joints in the surrounding rock mass. The joints make the degradation effect of the surrounding rock mass. According to these features, a new visco-elasto-plastic constitutive model is proposed. The model has a comprehensive consideration of geometric damage of the fractured rock mass. Besides, regarding VC++ as a terrace, we use the secondary development function of FLAC3D to make a program of this constitutive model. It is a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and it can be used by the main program of FLAC3D. The new damage creep model of fractured rock mass is developed. In the project of Jinping I underground power houses in Sichuan, China, we use this program to analyze the long-term stability of underground caverns and guide the design of engineering. The results show that: it is quite strong feasible to use this new damage creep model to simulate the excavation of large underground caverns and analyze the long-term stability, and the analysis results can be used to guide the construction of engineering. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Complex, jointed rock masses are commonly encountered in both underground excavation and slope stability engineering. The strength, deformation and time-dependent characteristics of rock masses directly affect the stability measures and reinforcement requirements for engineering design, construction, and maintenance of these rock structures. Thus it is essential, that the effect of joints be considered in the estimation of the rheological properties of the rock mass. As most of the related large-scale hydropower projects are located in the deep, narrow valleys of south west China, their underground caverns are usually subjected to very high in-situ stresses strongly influenced by the topography. Under these circumstances, brittle rock failure and associated time effects often occur during cavern excavation and construction. Concomitantly, splitting failure which adversely affects stability has been experienced in side walls and other parts of these underground hydropower station caverns. |","Document Type

Fundamental testing of cement-to-formation bonding under stress is needed to provide better input to models quantifying the risk of debonding as a function of evolving stress conditions. This is particularly important for long term CO2 sequestration, where sealing of the injection wells has to last for centuries and where stresses are probably going to evolve with time. A new experimental technique is here proposed, whereby composite rock/cement plugs are created under stress and temperature. Different interface angles permit testing the interface shear strength and friction angle under unconfined compression. Direct tension tests are also performed in order to get insight on tensile bond strength. Results so far show that even for competent Berea sandstone, tensile failure seems preferentially to occur in the rock part and not at the interface nor in the cement part of the tested plug. Similarly, in unconfined compression, failure seems to occur primarily in the sandstone part of the plug. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Recent work has identified the well cement-to-rock interface as the weakest link, when it comes to leakage from wells [1, 2]. This leakage occurs for many older production wells, not necessarily from the target production reservoir, but often from higher, pressurized permeable layers [3]. Several experimental techniques have been used to investigate cement integrity: ring geometry under HPHT conditions [4], ""dog bone"" geometry cement specimens in direct uniaxial tensile tests [5], unconfined compression testing in a load frame equipped with axial and radial strain gauges to assess unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and elastic parameters [6] on a cement cylindrical specimen, cement bond shear strength testing where cement is pushed out of a rock borehole while measuring the applied force on the cement [7], direct shear testing (of concrete) in shear box [8], pure shear testing in load frame with modified, split anvils whereby only half of the tested specimen is compresses, as well as triaxial testing of concentric cylindrical specimens including casing, cement and rock [9]. |","Document Type

Due to the high geo-stress state of the surrounding rock mass in deep rock engineering, which attends to induce large deformation, rock burst, zonal disintegration and other disasters, the traditional theories of statics continuum rock mechanics cannot explain many problems in the deep rock engineering sufficiently. This article presents a new dynamic constitutive model in the view of dynamic failure, considering the release, dissipation and transfer of energy under the unloading of deep rock mass, during which process the volume deformation experience elastic resilience and volumetric dilatation, and the shearing deformation may experience pre-peak (elastic and internal frictional hardening stages) and post-peak (softening and residual failure stages) stages. This model also describes the relationship of the elastic resilience and volumetric dilatation with time, which establish the volume deformation constitutive model. And fracture lag time and failure time are employed to establish the rheological equation and strength evolution equation. With this model three numerical simulations had been carried out in different deep rock engineering to represent phenomenon and analysis mechanism of large deformation, rock burst and zonal disintegration 
1. INTRODUCTION
With the stable development of the economy and national defense, underground engineering tends to be constructed at the deep rock mass, such as thousands meter depth mining tunnels(Niechuan coal mine in China and gold mine in South Africa), seepage tunnels at hydropower station, nuclear wastes storages and deep national defense facilities(North American Aerospace Defense Command). New characteristic and scientific phenomena have been found in the deep rock engineering, which have many differences to the shadow underground engineering. The main differences of the deep rock environment to shallow depth are high geostress, high temperature, high osmotic pressure and large turbulence caused by excavation [1]. Therefore, the traditional theories of statics continuum rock mechanics cannot explain those problems in the deep rock engineering sufficiently [2,3]. |","Document Type

The typical shear behaviour of rock joints has been studied under a constant normal load (CNL) or zero normal stiffness condition, but recent studies have shown that this boundary condition may not replicate more practical situations, and that constant normal stiffness (CNS) is a more appropriate boundary condition to describe the stress-strain response of field joints. In addition to the effect of boundary conditions, the shear behaviour of a rough joint also depends on its surface properties and the initial stress acting on its interface. Despite this, exactly how these parameters affect the shear behaviour of joints is not fully understood because the stress-strain response of joints is governed by non-uniform asperity damage and the resulting gouge that accumulates on their interfaces. Therefore, an attempt has been made in this study to predict the complete shear behaviour of rough joints incorporating the asperity deformation under CNS conditions. In order to validate this analytical model, a series of CNS shear tests were conducted on rough tensile (natural) joints and their replicas at a range of initial normal stresses that varied from 0.4 to 1.6 MPa. Comparisons between the predicted shear behaviour and the experimental results show close agreement. 
1. INTRODUCTION
An appropriate evaluation of the shear behaviour of rock joints is vital, for instance when analysing the stability of rock slopes, designing excavations in jointed rock, assessing the stability of concrete dam foundations, and designing rock socked piles. In conventional studies, the shear behaviour of a joint is usually investigated in the laboratory under constant normal load (CNL) boundary conditions where the normal stress remains constant and the surface of the joint dilates freely during shearing. However in engineering practice, the normal stress acting on the joint interface may vary during shearing, and the joint dilation may be constrained by the confined environment formed across the interface. This often represents a constant normal stiffness (CNS) condition. The practical implications of this are movements of unstable blocks in the roof or walls of an underground excavation, reinforced rock wedges sliding in a rock slope or foundation, and the vertical movement of rock-socketed concrete piles. Several researchers have emphasised the fact that a constant normal stiffness (CNS) boundary condition is more appropriate for many field situations [1-7].|","Document Type

Crushable granular materials exhibit a complex hydro-mechanical behavior. On the one hand, the hydraulic state alters the crushability of the solid matrix. On the other one, particle fragmentation causes major variations of grain and pore size distributions, thus impacting hydraulic properties such as permeability and water retention curve (WRC). This paper addresses the continuum modeling of grain crushing in unsaturated sands within the framework of the Breakage Mechanics theory. This choice enables us to discuss the role of an evolving grain size distribution (GSD) on both mechanical and hydraulic properties. First, data available in the literature about the evolution of the WRC upon grain crushing are discussed, thus assessing the accuracy of the hypotheses about its evolution. Then, the model is used to simulate various hydro-mechanical loading paths, showing that it is possible to capture a rich set of macroscopic couplings associated with either high-pressure compression or wetting. Finally, the model is used to investigate the grainsize dependency of these coupling effects. Physical considerations at the micro-scale are used to elucidate the effect of grain breakage on the predicted coupling terms, setting a vision for the future application of this modeling approach also to other classes of geomaterials, such as rockfill and granular rocks. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Grain crushing is involved in a variety of geomechanics applications, from energy technology to natural hazards [1-4]. Field and laboratory evidences show that the fluctuation of the hydraulic state tends to cause particle breakage [5-7]. The hydrologic properties also evolve significantly as a result of fragmentation [8]. Hence, mechanical and hydraulic processes in crushable media involve two-way constitutive couplings and require specific theoretical and computational treatment. 
Breakage Mechanics [9] is a theoretical framework that, by means of an internal variable related with the GSD, is able to capture the microstructural changes arising upon crushing. By linking this approach to the capillary theory, it has been possible to predict the coupling between the degree of saturation and the yielding of a wet assembly [10]. Such approach has also been used to predict the size dependency of the crushing stress of unsaturated sands [11], as well as the coupling terms required to model their incremental hydro-mechanical response [12]. This paper builds on these findings and focuses on the assessment of the crushing-dependence of the WRC, as well as on its impact on the evolution of the macroscopic properties measured during loading and/or wetting paths. |","Document Type

The dynamic behavior of crack propagation and coalescence in rock is investigated using the distinct lattice spring model (DLSM). Discontinuum based element model has been proven as a promising tool in the study of dynamic fracture in brittle materials like rock. As a newly developed tool, the distinct lattice spring model (DLSM), compared with classical discrete element model (DEM), has advantages on computationally efficiency and being free of micro parameters calibration. This study further applies the DLSM to investigate the dynamic cracking and coalescence behavior in brittle material. First, central notched Brazilian discs (CNBD) were simulated under loading. The results on crack pattern and coalescence are in good agreement with the experimental observations. The 3D examination of the evolution of the crack showed the crack growth in 3D was not as 2D observation, e.g. crack propagation front is very irregular and failure might appear ahead of the crack tip. Second, the simulations on a perforated plate blasting loading reveals that the crack pattern highly relays on the mode of heterogeneity. More specifically, the micro-structure of the material plays an important role on dynamic crack propagation and coalescence. At last, blasting effect on a 3D volume has also been investigated. This study can be useful to provide better understanding of the failure of rock under dynamic loading with discontinuity or heterogeneity. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Crack propagation and coalescence in rock is a popular research topic especially in underground excavation projects or slope stability problems in which the dynamic fracture phenomena are in dominance. To reduce the scale of the problem, different models are designed for experimental studies (e.g. perforated thin plate model [1] and pre-notched disc model [2]). These models focus on the most important feature of the crack during fracturing by setting up specific specimen configuration or loading condition. With the development of the modern technology, numerical methods have been improved a lot. Following the experimental model, numerical methods are applied on these models for validation or fundamental studies prior to applications on complicated project simulation.|","Document Type

The authors conducted the in-situ gas-tightness tests in a fractured rock at the Namikata underground LPG storage construction site in Ehime prefecture, Japan. The test consisted of two independent setups, a gas-tightness test that used boreholes, and a chamber-scale test that used a horizontal drift sealed with a concrete plug. In each test, the gas pressure was increased up to the onset of the measurable gas flow to obtain the maximum containment pressure. This paper discusses the hydraulic conditions for gas leakage initiation and the importance of the pore pressure measurement for monitoring the gas-tightness of the LPG storage cavern based on the test results. The results of preliminary two-phase flow simulation study based on the in-situ test results are also presented. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Gas transport characteristics of fractured rocks is a great concern to variety of engineering applications such as underground storage of LPG, nuclear waste disposal, CCS and gas flooding in the oil field. 
Besides absolute permeability, relative perme- ability and capillary pressure as a function of liquid phase saturation have direct influences to the results of two phase flow simulation. However, due to limited number of field tests, the applicability of the conventional two-phase flow functions, such as van Genuchten model or linear model to fractured rocks are not well understood. 
The authors conducted the two types of in-situ tests, with different scales, a borehole gas-injection test and a chamber water/gas injection test in fractured granitic rock. The test area was developed at the underground LPG storage cavern construction site (Kato et al., 2007) at Namikata in Ehime prefecture in Japan (Figure 1).|","Document Type

Discontinuities are prevalent in most rock masses and represent planes of preferential deformation and fluid flow. Shear displacements can significantly alter the hydro-mechanical properties of discontinuities and, thus, the hydro-mechanical properties of the entire rock mass. The importance of the network of discontinuities in controlling rock mass behavior has long been known and has led to an abundance of research on discontinuity shear strength and transmissivity. Although well-studied, key aspects of discontinuity behavior and characterization have received lesser focus, namely the evolution of asperity damage and discontinuity void space morphology as a result of shearing. In this paper, a methodology that combines the use of two recent technologies (micro-X-ray computed tomography and combined finite-discrete element modeling) is described to study these aspects of discontinuity behavior.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock mass discontinuities represent planes of relative weakness and enhanced hydraulic conductivity and, thus, have a significant influence on the hydromechanical behavior of the overall rock mass. While the shearing of rock mass discontinuities has been extensively studied in the past, there remains uncertainty surrounding the mechanisms by which surface asperities deform and degrade and how this degradation influences the aperture distribution. 
Although many studies have attempted to investigate asperity failure mechanisms, they have been hampered by the lack of appropriate visualization and modeling tools. In particular, until recently it was not possible to observe asperity damage without physically separating the joint specimen or explicitly modeling the development of damage during a direct shear test.|","Document Type

We report on numerical simulations of extended leak-off tests (XLOT) in a low-permeability rock formation and how they are impacted by the presence of a natural fracture. The simulations are carried out by using a newly developed modified discrete-element model (MDEM). The main features of XLOT are reproduced by the MDEM simulations. In the absence of a natural fracture, the hydraulic fractures created during XLOT grow perpendicular to the minimum principal stress. If a conductive natural fracture intersects the wellbore, fracture twisting is observed, and the XLOT pressure curves are markedly different from the pressure curves recorded in the absence of a natural fracture. 
1. INTRODUCTION|An extended leak-off test (XLOT) provides information on hydraulic-fracture initiation and propagation in a rock formation at a given depth, as well as the magnitude of the minimum principal stress [1-4]. XLOT is usually carried out in a few-meter long open-hole section below a casing shoe. In this way, the test also provides information on the cement integrity. The test consists of typically two to three injection cycles during which the well is pressurized until a hydraulic fracture is initiated (or re-opened) and propagated a few meters into the formation. After injection is stopped, the pressure decay due to leak-off and fracture closure is recorded. In low-permeability formations, leak-off is small so that flow-back is needed to induce fracture closure. Closure of the fracture results in an inflexion in the pressure vs. time curve, and this fracture-closure pressure directly corresponds to the minimum principal stress. |For vertical wells and simple stress and geological settings, analytical models can be applied to the description and interpretation of XLOT data, allowing for an accurate determination of the minimum principal stress. However, for deviated wells, rotated stress field, heterogeneous rock formations, or in the presence of natural fractures, the hydraulic fracturing process during XLOT can be rather complex (including fracture twisting or fracture snap-off), and conventional analytical models may not be applicable any longer [5].|","Document Type

This paper studies vertical stress redistributions around wellbores and reservoirs due to yielding and plastic deformations. The analyses in this paper compare between predictions of elastic, poroelastic, elastoplastic, and poroplastic material models. Two elastoplastic models are used: 1) The Drucker Prager Model (DP), and 2) The Mohr Coulomb Model (MC); while The Modified Cam Clay Model (MCC) is used as the poroplastic model. Although all models are calibrated to the behavior of an analogue shale using drained triaxial compression tests; the models give different predictions in other modes of shearing and other drainage conditions. Two geomechanical problems are considered in the paper: 1) The Wellbore Stability Problem, and 2) The Reservoir Depletion Problem; both of which are analyzed using the finite element commercial software ABAQUS. The wellbore problem considers an undrained vertical wellbore in uniform horizontal stress conditions using a 2D plane strain model. Analyses show that the MC model gives safe predictions and comparable results of vertical stress redistribution to that of the MCC model. The reservoir problem considers a circular disc-like reservoir using a 2D axisymmetric model. The initial stress distribution is considered; once assuming constant far field stresses, and also including the effect of variation due to gravity. Vertical stress redistribution is significant when plastic pore collapse is considered by using the MCC model for reservoir material. Analysis shows that assuming constant far field stresses is a good approximation to the reservoir depletion problem. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The geomechanical analysis of wellbores and reservoirs usually includes the assumption of constant vertical stresses. The safe mud window for stable wellbores is determined to prevent the hoop stresses from causing a breakout, ignoring possible change in vertical stresses. Dunayevsky et al. [1] formulated a semi-analytical solution to the thick wall cylinder problem. In this solution the vertical stresses are assumed constant. Zoback [2] formulated the DARS (Deformation Analysis in Reservoir Space) methodology to measure the stress path and compaction of a depleting reservoir. This stress path is considered in the reservoir space where only horizontal stresses vary with pore pressures. The idea of constant vertical stresses is plausible because at any given level the vertical stresses would be the weight of the overburden which is not expected to change. If the theory of elasticity is applied to the reservoir depletion problem, the vertical stresses do not change for infinitely long reservoirs. Segal and Fitzgerald [3] stated that for a reservoir of aspect ratio 10:1, the change in vertical stress can be ignored as predicted by the theory of elasticity.|","Document Type

Understanding fragmentation behaviour of rock under crushing process is fundamental to improved productivity and efficiency in mining operations. During crushing, rock is subjected to dynamic loading and the particle shape influent the fragmentation of crushed rock. Thus, a highly controlled single particle test, the dynamic spherical crushing test, should be performed to establish the relation between the energy and size reduction for better understanding the crushing mechanism. In this work, a split Hopkinson pressure bar system in combination with high speed cameras was utilized to carry out a single particle crushing test. Spherical rocks samples were adopted to avoid the shape effect for fragmentation process. The energy absorbed by samples was accurately determined from the one-dimensional wave analysis and the kinetic energy of the sample fragments estimated from the high speed camera snapshots. The crushed samples were recycled after the test. Further by counting the newly generated surface from sample fragments, the surface energy was determined for each sample. The indirect tensile strength is consistent with that of reported Brazilian disc test. The determined surface energy increases with the loading rate. Above results indicate a trade-off should be established between the fragment size and energy consumption .
1. INTRODUCTION
Crushers are widely used in the mining industry all over the world, which break rocks to extract specific minerals or specific size fractionation of fragmented rocks for construction. Suggested by many researches, highly controllable single particle test should be performed to understand the fundamental crushing mechanism of rock particle [1-3]. From single particle breakage data, we can acquire several important factors for crusher design and selection: particle strength [1-3] and the energy-size reduction relationships [1]. A wide range of laboratory techniques have been developed, which were broadly classified into three types based on loading methods [4]: slow compression breakage; single impact; double impact. The slow compression breakage method is known as utilizing two rigid plates break rock particle with slow speed (e.g. strain rate 10-3 s-1). The single impact utilized compressed air to accelerate rock particles to a designed speed and hit a solid surface, and investigate the breakage probability of particles; while the double impact test, such as drop weight test or pendulum test, is named in that particle is crushed by two hard surfaces. The disadvantage of the static compression test is that the loading speed is too slow as compared with those encountered in real crushers. The energy absorbed by particles during fragmentation cannot be acquired for single impact tests, which is also impossible for double impact test, except of some attempts made on the pendulum tester [2]. |","Document Type

The importance of an accurate geomechanical model for borehole stability assessment is increasing in the petroleum industry due to the growth in the number of drilling operations in unconventional reservoirs. These reservoirs are thin layered, naturally fractured with high clay content; the presence of clay minerals in particular, make their behavior to be unpredictable and also make the rocks to become chemically active with the drilling fluid. Thus, wellbore stability analysis is crucial and challenging; In addition a good understanding of elastic and physiochemical properties of the formation would be necessary for better field development to avoid future financial losses. For this study elastic, petrophysical and physicochemical properties of the shaly Bakken Formation were tested and reported from a several number of core plugs in different wells drilled in the Williston basin, North Dakota. We measured and reported various poro-mechanical, petrophysical and physiochemical properties of the Bakken shale along with the chemical properties of the drilling mud. The direction and the magnitude of the horizontal principal stresses were measured in the field with the data acquired from advanced logging tools in several wells. All of these values are coupled and used as input parameters in a time-dependent chemo-thermo-poroelastic constitutive model to calculate in-situ stresses and pore-pressure variations around the borehole. Changes in radial and hoop stresses were also plotted in the vicinity of the well. Mohr-Columb failure criterion was applied to the model to evaluate the deformations and failure occurrences around the borehole. Finally probabilistic risk assessment was carried out to understand the sensitivity of the results to the uncertainties in the input data. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Drilling in shale formations as the main target is becoming pretty popular with the recent growth in the production from shale oils throughout the world and specifically in the U.S. From many years in the petroleum industry, shales are attributed to drilling problems such as pipe sticking, washout and borehole collapse. Swelling, shrinkage and wellbore failure is a common phenomenon in chemically active shales, which is due to the high clay content [2, 3, 5, 6]. It has been reported that 90% of wellbore instability occurs in shale formations. As a result a good understanding of shale thermal, mechanical and physiochemical processes that take place during drilling operation would be inevitable to suppress the risks and future hazards. |","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing (hydrofrac) is a very successful method that has been used to extract oil and gas from highly carbonate rocks like shale for a number of decades. However, there are still many aspects related to hydrofrac operations and how they affect the hydrocarbon’s recovery levels that remain poorly understood. At Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the combined finite-discrete element (FDEM) modeling team is working in conjunction with an experimental team to improve the understanding of fracture initiation and propagation in shale rocks. In this paper, in order to address the effects of the fluid pressure, a pseudo fluid solver has been implemented in LANL’s in-house FDEM code. The pseudo fluid solver calculates the pressure in the fluid domain as a function of both the time and the distance from the fluid source. During the hydrofrac simulation, the pressure calculated from the pseudo solver is applied to the original free faces as well as the faces created by fracturing. After that, the sensitivity of the obtained fracture patterns related to uncertainties and/or changes in the boundary conditions is demonstrated using FDEM. Simulation results compared to triaxial core flooding experiments are presented. FDEM numerical simulations were able to replicate the main features of the fracturing processes while showing the importance of fluid penetration into fractures as well as layering in determining final fracture patterns. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing (hydrofrac) is a successful method used to extract oil and gas from highly carbonate rocks like shale and it has been used by industry since the mid- 50s [1-4]. However, there are many things that are still not clear regarding the mechanisms governing the hydraulic fracturing. To better understand how to improve hydrofrac recovery efficiencies and to lower its costs, LANL recently funded the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project: “Discovery Science of Hydraulic Fracturing: Innovative Working Fluids and Their Interactions with Rocks, Fractures, and Hydrocarbons”. Under the support of this project, the LDRD modeling team is working in collaboration with the experimental team to improve the understanding of fracture initiation and propagation in shale rocks. |","Document Type

E., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Munjiza, A., University of London","|Abstract
In this paper, the Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method (FDEM) has been applied to analyze the deformation of anisotropic geomaterials. In the most general case geomaterials are both non-homogeneous and non-isotropic. With the aim of addressing anisotropic material problems, improved 2D FDEM formulations have been developed. These formulations feature the unified hypo-hyper elastic approach combined with a multiplicative decomposition-based selective integration for volumetric and shear deformation modes. This approach is significantly different from the co-rotational formulations typically encountered in finite element codes. Unlike the co-rotational formulation, the multiplicative decomposition-based formulation naturally decomposes deformation into translation, rotation, plastic stretches, elastic stretches, volumetric stretches, shear stretches, etc. This approach can be implemented for a whole family of finite elements from solids to shells and membranes. This novel 2D FDEM based material formulation was designed in such a way that the anisotropic properties of the solid can be specified in a cell by cell basis, therefore enabling the user to seed these anisotropic properties following any type of spatial variation, for example, following a curvilinear path. In addition, due to the selective integration, there are no problems with volumetric or shear locking with any type of finite element employed.
1. INTRODUCTION
In this work a unified constitutive approach for a 2D composite triangle has been developed for the Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method (FDEM) [1-3]. Since its inception the FDEM has become a tool of choice for a diverse field of practical engineering and scientific simulations[4-9]. From the very initial idea of FDEM a large strain-large displacement formulation for the finite element side of FDEM has been employed in its exact multiplicative decomposition (as opposed to co-rotational) formulation. In recent years this formulation has been generalized through the concept of the so called Munjiza material element, which enables a pragmatic engineering approach to anisotropic constitutive law formulations for both large displacements and large strains in the context of the exact decomposition-based format. This approach has been recently described in detail in the book entitled “Large Strain Finite Element Method: A Practical Course” by Munjiza et al. [10], where also some novel concepts of selective integration have been proposed and applied to a whole family of finite elements. One of the elements proposed is the composite triangle finite element in 2D. In this work, this element has been implemented into an in-house FDEM software package. Through numerical examples the generalized anisotropic capabilities of the unified constitutive approach have been demonstrated and are presented in this paper. |","Document Type

Fracture coalescence has been identified as one of the factors playing an important role in the behavior of brittle materials. In this paper this phenomena is simulated by using an in-house implementation of the Combined Finite-Discrete Element method (FDEM). Key aspects of FDEM include the introduction of finite displacements, finite rotations, and finite strain based deformability combined with suitable material laws; the incorporation of discrete element based transient dynamics, contact detection, and contact interaction solutions and objective discrete crack initiation and crack propagation solutions that have a great deal of fidelity in reproducing complex fracture patterns and eventual fragmentation. The first examples presented in this paper consist of compression virtual experiments conducted on specimens that have two pre-existing flaws inside them. These fractures are arranged through the thickness of the specimens following different geometrical layouts. Some of the main features of the fracture propagation processes reported in this work are: initiation of wing cracks and secondary cracks; direction and propagation of the newly generated cracks and patterns of fracture coalescence. The results obtained in the simulations are qualitatively compared with experimental observations reported in the literature. This work is then extended to present results for a larger scale problem wherein fracture coalescence networks are observed when a pre-existing in-situ fracture network is stimulated. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock contains a large number of natural fractures at various scales as the result of a variety of geological processes. A thorough understanding of the cracking initiation, propagation, interaction and eventual coalescence processes emanating from existing in-situ flaws can benefit geological engineering design and implementation [1]. In order to understand the fracture process within brittle solids, Horii and Nemat-Nasser carried out a series of uniaxial compression tests using resin plates that contained artificial pre-existing cracks [2]. Following their work, crack coalescence in rock materials has been extensively studied, both experimentally and numerically [3-9]. |","Document Type

With an abundance of scientific information in hand, what are the remaining geomechanics issues for a salt repository for heat-generating nuclear waste disposal? The context of this question pertains to the development of a license application, rather than an exploration of the entire breadth of salt research. The technical foundation supporting a licensed salt repository has been developed in the United States and Germany since the 1960s. Although the level of effort has been inconsistent and discontinuous over the years, site characterization activities, laboratory testing, field-scale experiments, and advanced computational capability provide information and tools required for a license application, should any nation make that policy decision. Ample scientific bases exist to develop a safety case in the event a site is identified and governing regulations promulgated. Some of the key remaining geomechanics issues pertain to application of advanced computational tools to the repository class of problems, refinement of constitutive models and their validation, reduction of uncertainty in a few areas, operational elements, and less tractable requirements that may arise from regulators and stakeholders. This realm of issues as they pertain to salt repositories is being addressed in various research, development and demonstration activities in the United States and Germany, including extensive collaborations. Many research areas such as constitutive models and performance of geotechnical barriers have industry applications beyond repositories. And, while esoteric salt-specific phenomenology and micromechanical processes remain of interest, they will not be reviewed here. The importance of addressing geomechanics issues and their associated prioritization are a matter of discussion, though the discriminating criterion for considerations in this paper is a demonstrable tie to the salt repository safety case. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Geomechanical response of the geologic formation to perturbations caused by excavation, structural evolution over time, subsequent disposal of heat-generating waste, and emplacement of sealing systems are first-order concerns for heat-generating nuclear waste disposal in salt. Use of salt formations for toxic waste and transuranic waste disposal is supported by broad technical understanding and experience gained from operating facilities in the United States (U.S.) and Germany. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico represents a successful process of site characterization and licensing of a salt repository in the U.S., while Germany has compiled the Preliminary Safety Analysis for Gorleben (Vorlaufige Sicherheits-analyse Gorleben or VSG) [1]. Sufficient scientific bases exist to develop a viable safety case for heat-generating waste if a national program should decide to move in that direction.|","Document Type

A., Geomechanica Inc.| Lisjak, A., Geomechanica Inc.| Mahabadi, O. K., Geomechanica Inc.| Vlachopoulos, N., Queen’s University","|Abstract
In recent years, analyses based on the hybrid finite-discrete element method (FDEM) have been shown to provide a realistic representation of rock deformation and fracturing processes at laboratory and engineering scales. However, the ability to model linear rock reinforcement elements within FDEM has been largely limited. Through a collaborative research effort between Geomechanica Inc. and Queen’s University, an implementation of one-dimensional linear rock reinforcement elements has been recently developed to extend the applicability of FDEM modeling to a wider scope of rock engineering problems. While previous verification efforts have considered pure axial loading, the current paper extends these efforts to more complex shear loading. Through a series of small-scale double shear test simulations, the resulting specimen damage and reinforcement deformation profiles are compared to those observed in a larger-scale physical laboratory test. However, no attempt is made to match the laboratory tests directly; rather the ability of the approach to capture the general mechanistic behavior is assessed. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock support and reinforcement measures are widely employed in civil and mining rock engineering projects to maintain or improve rock mass integrity. The preferred type of reinforcement or support elements along with the preferred layout and installation timing depend on many factors, including: the in-situ conditions (i.e., stress, rock strength and rock mass quality), the nature of the project (i.e., long term or short term support), and the selected excavation method (i.e., drill and blast or mechanical). 
Over the last two decades, numerical modeling has been increasingly used to design and optimize rock reinforcement and support systems. As such, most rock engineering-specific modeling software includes approaches for modeling various rock reinforcement and support elements.|","Document Type

In this paper, the integrity of sand screen is evaluated for various depletions using fluid-mechanical coupling analysis. The interaction between the screen and reservoir is captured by rock-structure interaction model, based on laboratory tests that measured the mechanical properties of ceramic proppant, the formation sandstone and sand screen. The frictional hardening properties of the ceramic proppant and sandstone core plugs are measured by performing constant mean-stress tests in rock mechanics laboratory. The volumetric hardening curve of sandstone is measured in isotropic compression tests (with unloading excursions). The elasto-plastic mechanical properties of sand screen are determined by calibrating the laboratory crushing test data. For a given maximum depletion, this model can be used to select appropriate sand screens; conversely, for a given sand screen, this model can be used to estimate the depletion where failure is likely. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The reduction of formation pore pressure induced by fluid production in water and hydrocarbon reservoirs could result in many serious consequences, including subsidence of earth surface, loss of overburden integrity, reduction of porosity and permeability of formation, damage of well construction and production parts such as casing and tubing strings (Schutjens et al., 2004, 2008).
Open-hole standalone screens and gravel packs are often-used sand control methods in unconsolidated sandstone. As reservoir pressure depletes, the effective stresses in the formation increase. The depletion-induced increase in effective stresses are further magnified by the near wellbore stress concentration. Because the strength of unconsolidated sandstone is low and the gravel pack provides only a limited support to the wellbore wall, plastic deformation near the well seems inevitable in many wells. As a result, the forces acting on the sand screen increase. When formation loads exceed the loading capacity of the sand screen, the integrity of the screen is lost resulting in sand control failure and lost production.|","Document Type

In situ tests implemented in a research facility mined from salt deposits, if planned appropriately, provide an opportunity to characterize the host rock before, during, and after excavation of test rooms. Characterization of the test bed is essential to interpret structural deformation, creation and evolution of the disturbed rock zone, and measurement of first-order hydromechanical properties as the salt evolves from an impermeable undisturbed state to a more-transmissive damaged state. The strategy expounded upon in this paper describes recommended geophysical measurements to characterize the initial state of a potential test bed and its evolution over the course of a field test. Discussion includes what measurements could be made, why the measurements would be made, how they are made, and how accurately they need to be made. Quantifiable parameters will establish field-scale boundary conditions and data quality objectives to characterize the test bed in an underground salt research facility.
1. INTRODUCTION
Salt formations enjoy many favorable characteristics that combine to make them promising media for permanent radioactive waste disposal [1]. Salt formations are plentiful in the United States, providing ample areal extent and substantial thickness in aseismic geologic settings [2]. In addition to high thermal conductivity and plastic deformational response, undisturbed salt has extremely low permeability and porosity. Some of the favorable characteristics are modified during the excavation process and evolve during operations. Accounting for these fundamental structural and hydrologic changes is essential for establishing credible repository performance models needed to support waste disposal licensing activities. Before conducting experiments or operational demonstrations in a salt underground research facility, significant changes have already occurred in the salt, leading to a disturbed environment for hosting experiments. The disturbed rock zone (DRZ) near the excavation free surfaces contains inter-connected flow paths between pre-existing, but previously impermeable formation brine filled porosity, and becomes an anisotropic region of higher permeability and porosity. Depending upon experiment objectives, liberated brine, either in the vapor or liquid phase, and increased porosity can significantly influence evolution of the test bed. In addition, transient creep strain accumulates rapidly at the onset of excavation, but is not measurable once mining has already occurred. Using only observations from within the excavation overlooks potentially large strain accumulation in the salt formation. To model salt deformation completely, we must account for the transient creep contribution. Fortunately, evolutionary characteristics of salt are qualitatively known and straightforward engineering measurements can be made to quantify early evolution. This can allow the experimentalist to capture fully the early deformation for structural model development and validation. |","Document Type

The primary aim of this research work is to investigate the mixed modes I (tensile) and II (shearing) fracturing mechanisms of Brisbane Tuff rock and prepared concrete samples using Semi-Circular Disc (SCD) and Cracked Chevron-Notched Brazilian Disk (CCNBD) specimen geometries. In order to create various mixed mode loading conditions, the chevron notch cracks of the CCNBD specimens were oriented at notch crack inclination angles, <U+00DF>, of 0°:, 30°:, 45°:, and 70°: as part of the diametral testing procedure, whilst the SCB specimens were cut at the same <U+03B2>s prior to conducting the three-point bending tests. The experimental study revealed that the CCNBD geometry and the Brisbane Tuff rock have higher failure loads than the SCD geometry and concrete sample counterparts. Following the experiments, a series of numerical analyses were then performed using FRANC2D software to simulate the stress distributions and fracturing behaviour of the samples at different <U+03B2> values. Overall, this investigation showed <U+03B2>, and hence the mixed mode loading condition, is a function of failure load, stress distributions, position of the pre-existing cracks relative to the major principal stress and fracturing behaviour of brittle materials 
1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND |Engineering rock structures are primarily designed to withstand the loads they are expected to be subjected to whilst in service (Ceriolo and Di Tommaso, 1998). However, majority of mining, civil, and geotechnical large-scale structures are comprised of brittle materials (e.g. natural-forming rocks, construction aggregates, etc.) containing multiple inherent cracks and/or discontinuities that provide favourable paths for crack propagations (Chong and Kurrupu, 2012). Hence, when such rock mass structures are subjected to complex loading conditions, an abrupt and violent release of material’s stored elastic strain energy caused by rapid crack propagation is highly inevitable (Hoek, 1968). As a result, the mining, civil and geotechnical industries are persistently susceptible to significant safety hazards, material damage, and interruption or even cession of engineering operations (Szwedzicki, 2003). |","Document Type

In this study, straight notched disk bending (SNDB) specimens of Yeongju granite were used to determine the fracture toughness with wide range of loading velocity from 0.01 to 680,000 mm/min. The SNDB specimens were dynamically loaded with the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system. Static fracture toughness values of the granites were also determined to compare with the dynamic fracture toughness. The measured fracture toughnesses KIc under the static and dynamic loading condition were plotted against the loading rate v on a logarithmic graph. The crack opening behavior around the tip of the notch during dynamic loading was observed by using a high speed digital camera. The fracture planes around the notch tip inside the tested samples were observed by a high-resolution microfocus X-ray CT scanner.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fracture toughness is an indication of the amount of stress required to propagate a preexisting crack and is one of the most important properties of any material for many design applications such as rock drill bit, rock crushing and hydraulic fracturing in a wellbore[1]. It is well known that the fracture toughness of rocks is dependent on the material properties and the surrounding environment condition such as loading rates, temperature etc.[1]. Many researchers reported that fracture toughness increased with increasing the loading rate[2,3]. It is still a great issue that why rock materials show strong loading rate/strain rate dependency of fracture toughness and strength.
In this study, the straight notched disk bend (SNDB) method was adopted to measure static and dynamic fracture toughness of granite. The SNDB samples were loaded under different loading rates using MTS machine and split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system. High speed digital camera system was used to observe the fracture behavior at the tip of the notch of SNDB samples during dynamic impact loads. The fracture planes around the notch tip of the tested samples were observed by microfocus X-ray CT scanner. |","Document Type

The creep deformation of surrounding rock masses is a commonly encountered geological hazard that presents significnat harm to deep buried soft rock tunnels. Creep deformation frequently occurs during the operation periods of tunnels. In this study, the long-term rheological properties of the surrounding rock in a Lanjiayan deep buried phyllite tunnel were investigated. A rheological model and the rheological parameters of the tunnel were established based on the results of a triaxial creep laboratory test. The theoretical curves obtained from the proposed rheological model corresponded with the test curves. The variation laws of the plastic zone and deformation in the secondary lining over time were also investigated. Furthermore, the cross sectional shape of the tunnel boundary and thickness of the deformation layer were optimized
1. INTRODUCTION|Phyllite is a phyllitic-structured type of low grade metamorphic rock. Phyllite softens easily in water and has a uniaxial compressive strength that decreases significantly in a water-saturated state. The saturated uniaxial compressive strength of phyllite (<25 MPa) can be reduced to <U+00BD> ~ 1/3 of its original strength [1]. According to the Standard for the Engineering Classification of Rock Masses [2] and the Code for the Investigation of Geotechnical Engineering [3], phyllite is a soft rock. Engineering practice shows that, after the excavation and supporting of a deep soft rock tunnel, the deformation of its surrounding rock undergoes increasing amounts of rheological processes over time. After a certain period of time, large amounts of deformation occur, which can lead to the failure of supporting structures. Thus, the rheological properties of the surrounding rock of tunnels have been studied frequently. D. Sterpi and G. Gioda [4] used plastic, viscoelastic and viscoplastic elastic and rheological models to simulate the three stages of the creep behavior of rocks subjected to the high amounts of geostress in a deep tunnel. D. Debernardi and G. Barla [5] proposed a new viscoplastic constitutive model to describe the mechanical properties of the surrounding rock stratum of a large extrusion tunnel, while considering both the elastoplastic and viscoplastic properties of the tunnel. A. Fahimifar [6] deduced the analytical solutions for circular tunnel deformation under hydrostatic pressure and predicted the displacement of a wall over time by assuming that the surrounding rock consisted of incompressible Burgers viscoelastic materials. P. Nomikos [7] studied the stress and displacement characteristics of the surrounding rock of a tunnel using an axisymmetric Burgers model and analyzed the effects of the viscoelastic parameters and rheological properties of the surrounding rock on those characteristics.|","phyllite,  high geostress, deep buried tunnel,  long-term stability,  rheological properties"

Once placed in the underground mine excavations (stopes), cemented paste backfill (CPB) structures have to satisfy certain mechanical resistance requirements to ensure a safe underground working environment for all mining personnel. Moreover, mine backfill failures have considerable financial ramifications and can result in fatalities or injuries. One of the key parameters for assessment of the mechanical resistance of CPB structure and often used in the practice is its strength; namely, unconfined compressive strength (UCS). Knowing the time at which the CPB reaches its reasonable strength is very important for reducing the mining cycle and ensuring the safety of mine workers. In this paper, a numerical model is developed (and implemented into FLAC software) for predicting the UCS development and distribution of undrained hydrating CPB structure, taking into account the coupled effects of temperature (thermal factor) and binder hydration (chemical factors). Data from field and laboratory studies are employed to validate the developed model. The validation results show a good consistency between the predicted and the field and laboratory results. The developed tool is then used to simulate the strength development within CPB structures in several practical cases. The developed tool can contribute to more cost-effective and safer design of CPB structures.
1. INTRODUCTION
Mining industries contribute strongly to the economy of Canada and many other countries [1-4]. Aside from significant economic contributions, mining activities also generate a large amount of solid waste, such as waste rock and tailings. In Canada, it is estimated that about 500-650 million tons of waste are generated annually [5-6]. This issue is also faced by mining industries worldwide because they follow the same mining principle for extracting valuable minerals and disposing waste [7-8]. In the not so-distant past, surface impoundments were the most widely used method of tailings disposal, and even the returning of tailings to underground mines has long been practiced for the purpose of assisting mining operations [9]. However, the surface disposal of such waste can create several environmental and geotechnical problems. 
Public perception and strict government regulations with regards to the disposal of such waste compel the mining industry to develop new strategies which are environmentally sound and cost effective. In this scenario, the recycling of such waste into mining or civil engineering construction materials have become a great challenge for the mining and civil engineering community [10]. In recent decades or years, there is an increasing trend to make the tailings a useful construction material [e.g., 11-12]. One of these materials is mine backfill. In mine backfilling, the tailings and/or waste rocks are returned to the underground to fill the voids left by ore extracting in the form of mine backfills (hydraulic backfill, rockfill, and cemented paste backfill). Cemented paste backfill (CPB, mixture of dewatered tailings, water and binders) is the most used method of mine backfilling in Canada and many other countries. As a relatively new technology, CPB has been increasingly and intensively used for the backfilling of previously mined-out underground voids (which are called stopes) in many mines around the world over the past three decades [13-14]. The application of CPB can produce substantial economic and environmental benefits as well as ensure a safe work environment in underground mines|","Document Type

Fracture intersections play a crucial role in the hydraulic connectivity of flow paths in rock, yet no technique has been developed to characterize the condition of an intersection. An approach, to elastic wave characterization of intersections, is to assume each block that composes the intersection supports a wedge wave and that these wedge waves are coupled through the points of contact along an intersection. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of group theory to predict the number of vibrational modes supported by a fracture intersection. Five predicted vibrational modes are supported by the intersection for the case of a fracture intersection formed from fractures with the same specific stiffness. Laboratory measurements on an intersection between two orthogonal fractures showed the existence of several vibrational modes that are strongly affected by the polarization of the shear wave source and the uniaxial loading conditions 
1. INTRODUCTION
Throughout the subsurface of the Earth, fracture networks often control the three dimensional connectivity of the hydraulic flow paths. Fracture networks are composed of multiple fractures and fracture intersections. Although much work has been performed on elastic wave propagation across/along single fractures and sets of parallel fractures [1-4], the effect of intersections on elastic waves has been largely ignored or assumed to have little influence [5]. 
Typically, single and parallel sets of fractures are characterized by their mechanical properties, e.g. specific stiffness, which in turn provides information about the fracture topology, especially under stress [6-7]. These mechanical properties are linked to the hydraulic response of a fracture, i.e., linked to the spatial distributions of apertures and contacts within the fracture [8-11]. 
Here, we present results from a group theory analysis on an orthogonal fracture intersection under uniform loading conditions and fracture properties, i.e., a highly symmetric intersection. Several vibrational modes are predicted and described. The existence of these waves is demonstrated by using ultrasonic waves propagating along a fracture intersection on the laboratory scale. |","Document Type

Flowability is defined as the flow capability of a given granular material to flow under a given drawbell geometry and vertical stress condition. Gravity flow interferences of the broken material at a drawpoint (hang ups) highly influence the efficiency and production rate in block/panel caving mines. Despite its importance in underground block/panel, there is a lack of methods to estimate the flow-ability and hang up frequency for a given set of geotechnical conditions (vertical stress, particle size, fine content, drawbell geometry). The main objective of this article is to describe research conducted at the University of Chile, Block Caving Laboratory aimed to quantify the influence of the fine material, humidity and vertical load on the gravitational flow of caved rock. Experiments were conducted using a 1:75 scaled physical model to evaluate the flowability of caved rock under high vertical loads and with various percentages of fine material and humidity. The results show that vertical pressure fine contents and humidity highly influence flowability and hang up frequency. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Block/panel caving mining methods are adequate for exploiting massive, low-grade ore bodies because of their low productions costs, compared to other underground mining methods. High productivity and low operational cost, in addition to automation potential, make these methods a key factor in future massive deposits mining (Brown 2007).
In block/panel caving, ore production is affected by interferences associated with the caving process, especially those related to the gravity flow (Chitombo 2010). Hang ups and oversize rocks are the most common phenomena, which affect the mine design, draw strategies, mine recovery and, consequently, production rate.
Ore flow depends on ore properties, infrastructure geometry, and stress conditions. The flow condition or ability of a granular material to flow is defined as flowability. The flowability can be qualitatively classified into free flow, intermittent flow, assisted flow, and no-flow (Castro 2014). This classification depends on the ratio of particle size to opening size of the drawpoint (Laubscher 2000). Kvapil (2008) indicated that flowability depends on many parameters including particle size, extraction rate, particles<U+00B4> shape, surface roughness between particles, friction between particles, moisture content, compressibility, compaction, particle resistance as well as magnitude, distribution and direction of external loads and forces. However, to-date, the flow characteristics have not been well defined quantitatively (Gomez et al 2014). Studies using gravel show that the flowability of granular material is influenced by the vertical load (Fuenzalida 2012). Castro et al (2014) proposed a chart to present flowability of coarse and dry material in terms of vertical stress and drawpoint width/d50 (Figure 1). These charts were derived based on the experiments carried out using dry material and without the presence of fines. |","Document Type

The paper presents three-dimensional numerical model for multiple fracture propagation from the horizontal wells. A 3D numerical model is developed using a combination of the displacement discontinuity method and the finite element method. The reservoir rock mass is assumed homogenous, isotropic, and linear elastic. The fluid flow inside the fracture is assumed laminar flow and the fluid follows Newtonian behavior. The Galerkin’s finite element approach is used for the fluid flow modeling, the rock mass deformation is simulated using the elastic displacement discontinuity method, and the crack tip displacement approach is implemented for mixed-mode fracture propagation. Details of mathematical formulations and methodology for numerical implementation are presented first. Then, the numerical model is verified with some known analytical and semi-analytical solutions. Finally, numerical examples of planar and non-planar multiple fracture propagation in case for sequential and simultaneous fracturing procedure in the Niobrara Chalk formation have been presented. The results demonstrate the effects of in-situ stress, rock and fluid properties, and the “stresses shadowing” effect which mainly depends on the spatial interval between the fractures plays a critical role in the multiple fracture propagation. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Horizontal well fracturing is applied to improve well productivity from lower quality reservoirs that could not have been economically developed using the conventional fracturing methods. The idea of simulation by hydraulic fracturing is to create a large volume of fractured rock with enhanced permeability with multistage fracturing. The multi-stage fracturing is carried out either in simultaneous or sequential manner from perforation clusters. In case of simultaneous fracturing, the multiple fractures are created and propagated at same time from clusters, whereas in case of sequential fracturing, the fractures are created from one cluster after another usually by keeping the previously created fracture either propped or pressurized with fluid [1].|Several numerical models have been presented to study multiple and multistage fracturing from the single and multiple horizontal well. Most are based on analytical stress analysis method [2, 3], semi-analytical method [4], 2D numerical fracture mechanics models [1, 5] or planar 3D model [6]. Stephen et al. [7] have presented a 3D model based on boundary element method for simultaneous propagation of multiple fractures from a single horizontal well. In this paper, we present a 3D boundary element model with capabilities to simulate any number of fractures in case of simultaneous or sequential propagation schemes from a single or multiple horizontal wells. The main emphasis have been given to evaluate the influences of induce stresses change or “stress shadowing” effect on the multiple fracture propagation.|","Document Type

Biot’s coefficient can be expressed by a few different equations, and consequently, these equations may represent different approaches to measure this coefficient. We developed a combined method to measure the Biot’s coefficient by three different approaches based on three different equations using a single laboratory setup. The methodology is to measure the bulk modulus of a rock sample by conducting a drained hydrostatic test, and then to adjust the confining pressure and pore pressure to derive their correlation upon a constant volumetric strain condition, and then to conduct a series of drained hydrostatic compression and hydrostatic depletion tests to obtain the relationship between pore volume and rock bulk volume changes. The last step is to unify the pore pressure and confining pressure or keep a constant difference between confining and pore pressure in case the pore fluid and confining fluid are different to simulate an unjacketed hydrostatic test to acquire the grain bulk modulus of the rock. This method requires accurate and direct strain measurement and a fully saturated rock sample. This method allows us to acquire the Biot’s coefficient using a single rock applying different loading conditions based on three different equations. We demonstrated the measurement methods for both permeable rocks (Berea sandstone and Indiana limestone) and relatively impermeable rocks (Westerly granite and Asmari limestone). Different pore fluids (mineral oil, de-ionized water and nitrogen gas) were used for different rocks in order to achieve better measurements, and thus there are minor differences of the operation when dealing with different types of rocks. |","Document Type

H., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","|Abstract
To understand shear wave generation observed during underground explosions several source-physics experiments (SPE) in fractured granitic rock mass were conducted at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). Fractured rock present challenges: fractures are poorly characterized and sparsely sampled; the geomechanical and geophysical properties of fractures are unknown and measured at the laboratory scale; and the spatiotemporal scale-disparity between the near source explosion physics and the far-field wave propagation physics requires considerable computing resources to simulate geophysical signatures from source-to-receiver. To build a credible model of the subsurface we integrated the geological, geomechanical and geophysical characterizations conducted at NNSS. Because detailed site characterization is limited we numerically investigated the effects of the characterization gaps on the overall response of the system. Using HPC, we performed several computational studies to identify the key geologic features that affect the most the ground motion in the near-field and in the far-field using stochastic representation of the subsurface. Using brute force Monte Carlo simulations and sampling judiciously the large hyperspace of parameters, we have probabilistically conducted several sensitivities studies on the geological, geomechanical and geophysical parameters. Such studies would help guiding site characterization efforts to provide the essential data to the modeling community.
1. INTRODUCTION
Improved understanding of explosion generated wave motions through numerical modeling helps advancing the interpretation of seismic data for nuclear explosion monitoring (NEM) and nuclear explosion forensics. Currently, there are several significant challenges for the monitoring community, such as understanding the effects of emplacement material properties, depth of burial, damage, pre-stress and near-source heterogeneities on wave motion amplitudes, and the generation and partitioning of energy into different modes (e.g., compressional and shear waves, body and surface waves). Understanding these phenomena will improve yield estimation and event identification by accounting for predictable effects on wave motions due to source emplacement, near source heterogeneity, and path specific propagation effects. Knowledge gained on these effects can then be applied to regions where no empirical data exist, either in regions without historical explosion sources or seismic recordings or for explosions conducted under un-calibrated emplacement conditions. Numerical simulations provide a versatile tool to gain insight into the generation and propagation of wave motions, including both nonlinear and linear effects. Explosions are well known to involve the near instantaneous release of high temperature and pressure gas in a small volume of space. These high energy densities cause irreversible nonlinear behavior in the surrounding host material (rock) due to the generation and propagation of the outgoing hydrodynamic shock wave. It has been long appreciated that nonlinear response effects at the explosion emplacement have a strong impact on the observed far field seismic motions (e.g., Werth and Herbst, 1963; Perret and Bass, 1975; Murphy, 1981; Rodean, 1981; Denny and Johnson, 1991). However, a full understanding of these effects has been hampered by limitations in the knowledge of and computational requirements to represent all relevant nonlinear material response effects and to propagate waves from the source region to receivers. Advances in numerical methods and more powerful computational resources now make it possible to routinely compute the hydrodynamic response of earth materials to buried explosions with continuing improving fidelity. These studies justify optimism that explosion generated waves for other emplacement geologies and conditions can be predicted by hydrodynamic modeling and that the proposed approach can reduce uncertainties in NEM source estimates. Furthermore, to understand shear wave generation observed during underground nuclear explosions several surrogate chemical source-physics experiments (SPE) in fractured granitic rock mass were conducted at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). SPE data will be used to explain the genesis of the observed shear motions.|","Document Type

Leakage to the atmosphere of a significant fraction of injected CO2 would constitute a failure of a geological CO2 storage project. We present a numerical model that simulates flow and transport of CO2 into heterogeneous subsurface systems. The model, StoTran, is a flexible numerical environment that uses state-of-the-art finite element and AMR scheme implemented using MPI and OpenMP protocols. Multiphase flow equations and the geomechanical equations are implicitly solved and either fully or sequentially coupled. In the current study, StoTran has been used to simulate several scenarios spanning from a homogeneous single layered reservoir to heterogeneous multi-layered systems, which including cap-rock with embedded fractures, have been simulated under different operations of CO2 injection and CO2 leakages conditions. Results show the impact of the injection and leakage rates on the time evolution of the spread of the CO2 plume, its interception of the fractured cap-rock and the risk associated with the contamination of the overlaying aquifer. Furthermore, several leakage scenarios show the intermittence behavior and development of the CO2 plume in the subsurface. A remedy to CO2 leakages from the reservoir using silica gels is presented to enhance and ensure a long term containment of the injected CO2. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Global temperatures are increasing. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is increasing (Figure 1). New carbon management legislation and initiatives are based on the assumption that increased CO2 levels are a major cause of global warming. Several ways of reducing CO2 emissions and CO2 levels in the atmosphere include: improved efficiency in power generation by upgrading existing plants, higher efficiency in all new plants, relying more on renewable energy and nuclear-generated power, distribution of energy consumption among other resources and finally, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Of all emissions reduction mechanisms, CCS is projected to provide the largest contribution to emissions reduction in the near-term (~decade time scale). CCS begins with capture of CO2 at its source, such as a coal fired power plant, transporting the CO2 to a location where it can be sequestered or stored safely away from the earth's atmosphere and oceans. Three types of CO2 sequestration are under way: terrestrial sequestration, geologic sequestration, and mineralization. Geologic sequestration is storage of CO2 within geological formations under the earth's surface. Oil, gas, nonmineable coal and saline water reservoirs are those best suited for CO2 sequestration (DOE 1999). |","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing is widely employed to stimulate oil and gas reservoirs to increase the productivity of these naturally fissured rock domains. Different numerical techniques are available to examine how hydraulic fractures propagate. They are mainly categorized into continuum and interface-based methods. Cohesive models are among the most effective class of interfacial approaches representing crack surfaces as sharp material interfaces. In lieu of a traditional cohesive model, we have formulated and employed an interfacial damage model that incorporates the processes of nucleation, growth and coalescence on the fracture surfaces. Utilizing a dynamic adaptive meshing, we employed a Spacetime Discontinuous Galerkin (SDG) finite element method to simulate hydraulic fracture propagation. Our SDG implementation adaptively aligns the element boundaries with crack-path trajectories that are obtained as a part of the solution according to a crack growth criterion. Thus, this model does not suffer the mesh-dependent effects encountered in most other numerical fracture models. Furthermore, no discontinuous features are introduced within the elements as opposed to XFEM and generalized finite element methods. Adaptive mesh refinement in an area allows free nucleation, growth and branching of cracks oriented arbitrarily in the domain without any mesh bias whereas a coarse mesh can be used in other regions of the domain to utilize an efficient implementation. Presenting numerical examples, we performed a sensitivity analysis of some input variables such as the magnitude of in-situ stress components, number and orientation of induced fractures is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in resolving hydraulic fracturing.
1. Introduction
Enhancing production from shale and other tight formations has become one of the main challenges in oil industry. Since these formations have extremely low permeability and low porosity, the technique of hydraulic fracturing is widely employed as a treatment to increase production rates. Hydraulic fracturing treatment being rapidly developed has changed the energy industry throughout the world. Understanding how fractures initiate and propagate from wellbores is necessary to efficiently perform such a costly treatment. Wellbores are commonly perforated in wells with cemented liners before hydraulic fracturing is carried out. This approach is called the plug-and-perf stimulation technique. Perforation plays the role of a fracture initially induced to control crack initiation and its propagation direction into the reservoir. Utilizing perforations as single fractures from the wellbore toward the reservoir can avoid multiple and reoriented fractures from a wellbore. A successful treatment via hydraulic fracturing to get better propagation pattern highly depends on different parameters including the length and orientation of the perforations, the magnitude of in-situ stress components known as stress anisotropy in the plane fracturing occurs.|","Document Type

This paper briefly reviews the application of various techniques including empirical, analytical and numerical methods in analyzing the surface subsidence associated with sub-level caving. Recent developments in empirical and analytical methods are first introduced. The application of numerical modelling in the characterization of surface subsidence and caving mechanisms is demonstrated using a relatively simple conceptual sub-level cave model and three numerical approaches i) a continuum finite element (FEM) ii) a discontinuum distinct element (DEM) and iii) hybrid finite/discrete element (FDEM) with fracture; the advantages and limitations of each method are discussed. A new deformation monitoring data interpretation technique using the inverse velocity method to predict the time of failure is briefly introduced and its application to sub-level caving is presented using the FDEM numerical method. Recent developments in the field of the discrete fracture network (DFN) and synthetic rock mass, (SRM), approaches and their use in improving our understanding of caving mechanisms are presented. Finally, a new approach to modelling sub-level caving considering intact rock fracture using a DEM UDEC-Trigon method is introduced and preliminary results presented. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Cave mining methods generally include mining operations where after undercutting the orebody caves naturally based on gravity flow; these methods include block caving, panel caving and sub-level caving [1]. Sub-level caving is a cost-effective mining method that enables a high degree of mechanization and automation. Mining using sub-level caving induces a large area of deformation on the hanging wall with a more limited area of damage on the footwall. Various parameters influence the observed hanging wall surface subsidence including depth of active mining, geometry and dip of the orebody, the mechanical properties of the intact rock and the characteristics of pre-existing discontinuities and geological structures. In general, mining using sub-level caving results in two types ground surface deformation zones: (i) the discontinuous zone and (ii) the continuous zone. These two surface deformation zones can be recognized as [2]:
• Discontinuous deformation zone characterized by formation of visible cracks on the ground surface and large horizontal and vertical deformations. Surface disturbance such as tension cracks, topographic steps and chimney caves are normally observed in this zone. The disturbance is more extensive in the hanging wall, although the footwall is also affected by the mining activity.• Continuous deformation zone characterized by uniform settlement and lowering of the ground surface which can only be detected by periodic monitoring with in general no visible surface cracking. |","Document Type

P., China University of Mining and Technology| Zhang, L., China University of Mining and Technology| Liu, G. J., China University of Mining and Technology| Liu, Y., China University of Mining and Technology","|Abstract
Clear understanding of coupled interactions between coal-rock and gas subjected to static and dynamic loading will be crucial to convince that coal-gas dynamic events can be effectively monitored. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by gathering microseism (MS) and acoustic emission (AE) information on the interactions of gas with coals and the effects of coal-rock fracture on abnormal gas emission. Field investigations disclose two phenomena observed for interactions of coal-rock fracture and gas emission: (1) overpressuring gas in coal can induce fast crack initiation and growth ultimately producing a gas outburst with relatively low energy; and (2) under the influence of a shock wave generated by dynamic loading such as a rockburst, the coal-gas medium may be destroyed. For smaller pressure and lower desorption energy, only abnormal gas emission is generated. The abovementioned phenomena occurred in a gas-containing coal seam, MS&AE activities prior to, during, and after two unusual gas emissions and the spectrum evolutions were analyzed, and the corresponding mechanisms were revealed.
1. INTRODUCTION
Since the first reported coal and gas outburst in the Issac Colliery, Loire coal field, in 1843[1], more than 14,000 outbursts have occurred in China [2]. Many researchers have studied relationships between coal outbursts and geological factors for different coal fields, and have come to different conclusions because of the complexity of the mechanisms. Coal and gas outbursts in mines are engineering geological hazards. The dynamic stress on coal and rock material closest to the outburst source results from additional impact load produced by roof fracture or blasting, will result in sudden rupture of coal material in the critical stress condition, produce fissures forming outburst channels, and accelerate the escape velocity of gas resulting in coal and gas outbursts [3]. For coal seams containing gas, an abnormal emission due to higher pressure of gas and higher stress may be an effective precursor for a rockburst. Simultaneously, recorded MS signals from roof strata may also be a precursor of coal and gas outbursts. Many abnormal gas emission phenomena following rockbursts have been reported and recorded in Chinese coal mines in the Fuxin and Beipiao coal fields in Liaoning province and Hegang coal mines in Heilongjiang province [4-6]. In addition, in the Rhine-Westphal coal field, Hawusike coal field, and Ruhr coal field in Germany, many rockbursts events have been accompanied by abnormal gas emissions [7, 8]. The correlation between rockburst and gas outburst was confirmed by MS observation, gas monitoring, and accident investigations by some scholars [9, 10-12].|","Document Type

This paper discusses a new computational strategy for the analysis of inelastic processes in granular rocks subjected to varying levels of confinement. The purpose is to provide a flexible and efficient tool for the analysis of failure processes in geomechanical settings. The proposed model is formulated in the framework of Lattice Discrete Particle Models (LDPM), which is here calibrated to capture the behavior of a high-porosity rock widely tested in the literature: Bleurswiller sandstone. The procedure required to generate a realistic granular microstructure is described. Then, the micromechanical parameters controlling the fracture response at low confinements, as well as the plastic behavior at high pressures have been calibrated. It is shown that the LDPM model allows one to explore the effect of fine-scale heterogeneity on the inelastic response of rock cores, achieving a satisfactory quantitative performance across a wide range of stress conditions. The results suggest that LDPM analyses represent a versatile tool for the characterization and simulation of the mechanical response of granular rocks, which can assist the interpretation of complex deformation/failure patterns, as well as the development of continuum models capturing the effect of micro-scale heterogeneity.
1. INTRODUCTION
An accurate knowledge of the engineering properties of rocks is crucial for a variety of geomechanical problems, ranging from wellbore stability, to failure in rock slopes, underground excavations, and crustal faults [1]. While strength and deformation properties are usually obtained from a limited number of in situ and/or laboratory tests, their determination is invariably affected by considerable heterogeneities [2]. Such lack of homogeneity impacts engineering conclusions at all length scales and requires appropriate theoretical and computational tools.
Advanced numerical modeling represents a useful tool to explore how mechanical processes interact across length scales. Considerable advances in this area have based on Finite Element computations, where heterogeneities can be incorporated at both sample and site scales [3-5]. Nevertheless, to capture realistically the path-dependent response of geomaterials, continuum formulations tend to be characterized by a large number of parameters. If such constants lack clear connections with measurable attributes (e.g., grain size and sorting), their calibration becomes poorly constrained. Furthermore, the tendency of rock samples to undergo strain localization [6, 7] further prevents the validation and/or implementation of continuum models, requiring a direct link between strain localization and microstructural attributes [8].|","Document Type

T., University of Colorado| Rajaram, H., University of Colorado| Dempsey, D., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Viswanathan, H. S., Los Alamos National Laboratory","|Abstract
Understanding the transport of hydraulic fracturing (HF) fluid that is injected into the deep subsurface for shale gas extraction is important to ensure that shallow drinking water aquifers are not contaminated. Pressure gradients, permeable pathways such as faults or improperly abandoned wellbores, and the density contrast of the HF fluid to the surrounding brine could encourage upward HF fluid migration. In contrast, very low shale permeability and well production may work to keep HF fluid at depth and remove it from the subsurface. Single-phase flow and transport simulations are performed to quantify how much HF fluid is removed via the wellbore and how much reaches overlying aquifers. If a permeable pathway connects the shale reservoir to the overlying drinking water aquifer, the pressure transient due to injection and the density contrast allows rapid upward plume migration at early times, but well production reverses the direction of flow and removes a large amount of HF fluid from the subsurface. We present estimates of HF fluid migration to shallow aquifers during the first 1,000 years and show that the pressure transient from well operations should be included in subsequent numerical models while buoyancy may be neglected depending on depth and permeability. 
1. INTRODUCTION|Hydraulic fracturing, often referred to as fracking, poses potential long-term risks to drinking water resources. One of the main concerns is that chemically treated hydraulic fracturing (HF) fluid and/or highly saline brine could migrate upwards from a shale gas unit and enter shallow drinking water aquifers. The HF fluid chemicals are used as viscosity reducers, biocides, surfactants, scaling inhibitors, and for other purposes [1]; while many of the additives are biodegradable and/or have low toxicity, approximately one third of the chemicals studied by Stringfellow et al. [2] do not have toxicity data, some are toxic, and some are known or suspected carcinogens. Of the 2-5 million gallons of HF fluid that is injected, 5-50% returns to the surface as flowback water [1], some unknown volume moves into the small pores of the shale via capillary imbibition, and the remaining volume is free to move within the subsurface, possibly towards drinking water aquifers. Public concern has prompted the EPA to study the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, which include aquifer contamination via subsurface leakage [3], while other studies suggest that aquifer contamination via a subsurface pathway is virtually impossible or would occur over extremely long timescales (>106 years) [4,5].|","Document Type

Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is one of two commercial in situ recovery technologies (the other is cyclic steam stimulation, CSS) being deployed for bitumen recovery within the vast oilsands reserves in Northern Alberta, Canada. However, to ensure the safe operation of SAGD, caprock integrity has to be maintained. In the past, most of the research efforts have been devoted to reservoir geomechanical simulation studies of SAGD caprock integrity. Physical modeling studies are conducted to a lesser extent. This paper describes a newly developed testing program of SAGD caprock integrity using the 50g-ton beam centrifuge, the first of its kind in Western Canada, at Geotechnical Centrifuge Experimental Research Facility (GeoCERF) at University of Alberta. Initial studies have utilized over-consolidated Speswhite kaolin block samples to mimic the caprock in centrifuge models instead of using in-situ caprock material for the purpose of eliminating the influences of property variability. At 100g centrifuge spinning, a 20cm thick test material can simulate a caprock formation of 20m, while stress profile in the centrifuge model is still similar to that in the prototype. In order to fail the caprock at 100g, a custom-designed electromechanical device named Geomechanical Caprock Deflection Mechanism (GeoCDM) is successfully manufactured and commissioned. Image-based displacement measurement technique of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is employed to measure the soil deformation. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is a widely used thermal recovery process for extracting bitumen from the oilsands reservoirs in Northern Alberta. Because of the continuous injection of high pressure and high temperature steam into the oilsands reservoir, the stress and strain fields in the reservoir and its surrounding formations are significantly altered, which may lead to the failure of the caprock overlying the reservoir. The 2006 Joslyn steam release incident has been a bitter lesson learnt from losing the caprock integrity [1]. Since then, tremendous efforts have been devoted to reservoir geomechanical simulation studies of SAGD caprock integrity. Physical modeling studies have been conducted to a lesser extent, as it is difficult to carry out physical modeling of prototypes at such a scale as SAGD projects. |","Document Type

Horizontal well hydraulic fracturing can help develop unconventional petroleum resources using techniques such as simultaneous and sequential fracturing. To achieve successful and desired stimulated rock volumes and fracture networks, it is beneficial to understand the effect of fracture spacing and various rock and fluid properties on stimulation to minimize the risk of unwanted fracture geometries. This paper investigates the effectiveness of fracturing techniques using a fully coupled 2D plane strain numerical model based on displacement discontinuity method [1]. The multi-stage fracturing model considers different boundary conditions for the previous stage fractures, such as constant pressure restricting the flow back between stages and proppant-filled. A series of examples are presented to demonstrate the effect of fracture spacing on resulting fracture system geometry and stimulated rock volume. The model is also used to compare the conventional zipper fracturing technique (i.e. fracturing multiple parallel horizontal wells sequentially) with modified zipper fracturing technique. The results highlight the fracture apertures and geometries to achieve optimization of fracturing process. The paper also discusses the effects of rock anisotropic characteristics of shale on the fracturing results 
1. INTRODUCTION
Increased interest in exploration and production of lower grade reservoirs presents new challenges in design and evaluation of hydraulic stimulation treatment of horizontal wells. Each treatment stage in a well is designed to stimulate a reservoir volume to create a desired permeability enhancement. The collective stimulated zones should affect the maximum volume with minimal overlap of adjacent treatment stages. Usually, fracturing treatment of horizontal wells is carried out using one of two schemes namely, Simul- Frac and Sequel-Frac. In simultaneous fracturing multiple fractures are created and propagated at same time whereas in sequential fracturing, fractures are created one after another usually by keeping the previously created fracture/fractures either propped or pressurized with fluid. Zipper fracturing is a technique where two or more lateral horizontal wells (usually at the same depth) are fractured simultaneously or sequentially [2]. The main purpose of zipper fracturing is to create close fractures and maximize stimulation effect, thus improving the stimulated rock volume. In all cases, the perforation clusters should be placed such that competing stress-shadow effects between them is minimized. By reducing the number of clusters per stage, costs are reduced and stress interference is minimized, reducing the possibility of having ineffective fracturing. |","Document Type

Accurate assessment of rock drillability is crucial in improving the rate of penetration and drilling efficiency in drilling process. In this paper, experimental research on rock indentation fragmentation by single-indenter at varying confining pressures has been carried out. Moreover, measuring tool of three-dimensional digital microscope has been applied to observe and analyze the shape and volume of crushing craters. A new breakability index (BI) of rock considering the impact of both invasion difficulty of tool and characteristic of rock brittleness is defined from force-penetration curve of indentation test. The relationship of both specific energy (SE) and volume of crater (Vc) with BI has been investigated, and the influence of confining pressure (Cp) on BI has also been studied. The results indicate that both the SE and Vc have a good non-linear correlation with BI, with increasing of BI, Vc increases, while SE decreases. Besides, a good exponential relationship between Cp and BI is also found, along with Cp increasing, BI decreases. It can be concluded that the greater the BI is, the more prone to breakage the rock is. Therefore, the proposed breakability index could be used for quantitative evaluation of rock drillability. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock drillability is an important parameter to estimate the difficulty of rock crushing. An accurate assessment of the rock drillability plays a major role in improving rate of penetration and reducing drilling cost in the oil and gas drilling process. However, the resistance of rock crushing is a function of multiple variables, including the type of tool and rock mechanical properties, there is no agreement to describe or measure it. Currently, various researchers have evaluated the rock drillability by using different approaches. The drilling comminution was theoretically and experimentally analyzed based on a fractal approach by Carpinteri A. and Pugno N. [2]. They developed a model to evaluate rock drillability and energy dissipation with fractal dimensions of rock cuttings in comminution process. In addition, some rock mechanical properties and drilling parameters have long been widely used to represent rock drillability or to predict the drilling rate [3, 4, 5]. Yarali O. and Kahraman S. investigated the relation between the resistance of rock breaking and rock brittleness and concluded that the rock brittleness determined from compressive and tensile strength can be used for assessment of rock drillability [6]. Nevertheless, it can be found that the methods mentioned above do not consider the comprehensive influence of the tools, rock properties and confining pressure, thus they cannot truly reveal the rock drillability. |","Document Type

For keeping an open-pit mine operational while a giant sliding mass exists and is flowing on the benches and minerals like debris, at this time, it is necessary to unload the sliding mass (debris). For achieving this, monitoring of sliding mass should be done along with unloading so that displacement and velocity values do not exceed a certain limit and do not cause a serious incident. One of the suitable software which is able to model this sliding mass and unload it, is PFC (Particle Flow Code) which is based on Discrete Element Method. This paper will describe how PFC was used to model a sliding mass in an open-pit mine and unloading it in seven stages has been done. During the unloading of sliding mass, maximum velocity and displacement among the particles have been obtained. Also, in this article the Angooran mine, which is the largest metal mine in Iran and also one of the most economical lead and zinc mines in the world, has been studied. Sliding mass volume that occurred in the Angooran mine was about 12 <U+00D7>106 m3, i.e. 25<U+00D7>106tons. The sliding mass moved about 100 m horizontally and 45 m vertically. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Slope stability is one of the most important issues in the construction and mining activities and any mistake in analysis can lead to irreparable damage. Utilizing the subsurface geological model, and results which are obtained from the field investigation and lab testing can help for analyzing slope stability by using suitable modeling methods. Slope movements might be minor and be limited to falling a small boulder or might be huge and catastrophic. In many cases, advancing failure or the slope rupture can be prevented while in other cases, improvement methods cannot be remedial. One of the example of this huge slide is the Angooran mine, one of the most economical lead and zinc open-pit mines in the world. Angooran mine is located in the northwest of Iran and has experienced a large scale slope failure in northern wall. Sliding mass volume that occurred in the Angooran mine was about 12 <U+00D7>106 m3, i.e. 25<U+00D7>106 tons (Fig. 1). Generally, the slope movements can affect engineering structures and human activities. Slope movements are different in many ways such as hugeness, speed of incidence, and predictability. Heavy or prolonged rainfall, melting snow, earthquakes, blasting in mining can be causes of slope instability. Creep, tensile cracks, and water leakage locations are surficial signs of instability. The Fig. 2 shows a sample of tensile cracks in the Angooran mine. |","Document Type

Acid stimulation of limestone and chalk reservoirs is a popular method to increase production. By flowing acid through hollow cylinder chalk specimens in the laboratory, we have created specimens with wormhole networks that have allowed us to study the impact of acidizing on rock strength in dedicated solids production tests. Comparing acidized samples with virgin reference samples reveal a reduction in the rock strength and earlier onset of borehole failure and solids production. The same effect is seen for both increasing depletion and increasing drawdown, but it is much more pronounced for the increasing drawdown case. Even though the rock strength is clearly reduced by the acidizing, there are no signs of wormhole collapse away from the near-borehole region. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Injection of acid into limestone or chalk reservoirs may be a cost effective way to stimulate oil production. The acidizing process results in the formation of wormholes that may act as flow channels and therefore increase the near wellbore permeability of the formation [1,2]. However, these wormholes may have unwanted side effects on formation integrity, especially for high depletion or drawdown, and these effects are not fully understood [3].
We have previously studied the mechanical stability of wormholes created by acidizing of 1.5"" chalk plugs by performing hydrostatic compaction tests, revealing that the wormholes collapse a few MPa below the onset of pore collapse, with a significantly larger pore-collapse pressure for oil-saturated samples as compared to saturation with brine [4]. In addition, the acidized samples showed a reduction in the pore-collapse pressure compared to intact plugs. |","Document Type

This paper used PFC2D to simulate bimrock mechanical behaviors under uniaxial compressive tests and presents the means and variances of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), Young’s modulus (E), and Poisson’s ratios (<U+03C5>) for various volume fractions and strain gauge lengths. The results show that UCS, E, and <U+03C5> increase as Vf increases, and simulated E and <U+03C5> were consistent with the differential scheme and Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. In quantifying the uncertainty of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio measurements using a strain gauge, the measurement uncertainties initially increase and then decrease with increasing Vf; when Vf =0.3~0.4 (0 or 1), Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio reach a maximum (minimum) value. In addition, crack propagation was also observed and discussed in this paper. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock strength and its elastic modulus are important geotechnical engineering parameters. However, it is difficult to obtain completely mechanical behaviors if rocks belong to highly heterogeneous media, i.e., melange and fault breccia, which are considered as a type of bimrock, and defined as “a mixture of rocks, composed of geotechnically significant blocks within a bonded matrix of finer texture” [1]. Because bimrock has chaotic block dispersion, it is difficult to sample the representative specimen. In addition, its engineering characteristics and mechanical behaviors are more complicated than other geomaterials. Volume fraction (Vf) plays an important role in bimrock mechanical behaviors [2-6].
Bimrock spatial variability could cause uncertainties in physical and mechanical measurements. Medley [7] manufactured physical synthetic bimrocks to investigate the uncertainty of Vf estimation using the scanline method. Tien et al. [8-10] proposed analytical and numerical solutions for quantifying the uncertainty of Vf measurements using the scanline method and a sampling window. Kahraman and Alber [3, 11-12] tested various sizes of fault breccia with a uniaxial compressive test; the results show that the variability of fault breccia strength decreases with increasing size. |","Document Type

In the Wanta-Sunglin hydropower project of Taiwan Power Company, a 5,947m-long tunnel passing through metamorphic slate formations was constructed by NATM method. Before the breakthrough of this tunnel in 2011, due to the variation of geological conditions, the excavation was blocked by shear zones with squeezing and creeping effects, until remedial measures and supporting adjustment were applied. Beside the difficult geological conditions, part of the alignment of this tunnel underpasses the Chuoshui River, which makes the support design even more challenging. This paper summaries the support designs, the tunnel deformation instrumentation, and the feedback analysis. In addition, the treatment and reinforced adjustment for the sections of river underpassing and shear zones were also illustrated and discussed. The experiences learned from this project can contribute to the other newly-built or rehabilitation hydropower projects in a similar situation.
1. INTRODUCTION
In order to more efficiently obtain the hydropower from the Wushe Reservoir, which is situated at the upstream of Chuo-Shuei River, Taiwan Power Company planned and constructed the Wanta-Sunglin hydropower project. It comprises the extension of Wanta hydropower plant and the newly built Sunglin hydropower plant. In the former Wanta extension project, a new intake shaft was built with a new tunnel passage to the power plant. And a long tunnel from the new Sunglin Weir to a new underground plant were built in the latter Sunglin project. The total length of tunnels built in the Wanta- Sunglin project is 5947m, see Figure 1. For the objectives, this hydropower project can generate green electrical power 0.125 billion KWH per year. In contrast with hydrocarbon generated power, this project can reduce the emission of CO2 by 67000 tons per year. In addition, as part of the hydropower system, it can improve the operation of the water reservoirs, in which the water for irrigation and utility usages can be more flexibly supplied.|","Document Type

In order to clarify the characteristics of hydraulic fracture in unconsolidated sands, we have been developing laboratory experimental apparatus to observe the hydraulic fracture behavior by the X-ray CT method. The apparatus should be designed satisfying conditions such as (i) specimens have a size to be sufficiently large for the fracture growth, i.e. more than few hundreds mm, (ii) the inside of such a large specimen is visualized within a time interval to be sufficiently short compared with a time period of few hundreds seconds required for fracture initiation and growth, and (iii) the specimen is subjected to tri-axial compression for simulating subsurface conditions. Considering those requirements, we developed several types of experimental apparatus, and finally succeeded to develop an apparatus which allows us to obtain within an interval of few seconds a CT image of a longitudinal slice of the fracture along the growing direction. The results clearly show characteristic behaviors of hydraulic fracture. For example, the fracturing fluid reached the fracture tip and invaded farther into the rock matrix; therefore, a non-wetted zone did not develop at the fracture tip, in contrast to that observed in hard rocks. 
1. INTRODUCTION|In recent petroleum engineering, hydraulic fracturing techniques are applied not only to brittle formations but also to unconsolidated one for enhancement of production. The unconsolidated sands have properties of rather higher permeability more than 10 mD and fairly weaker bond between particles compared with hard rocks. For those reasons, fracturing behavior in unconsolidated sands is not suitably represented by existing models for brittle, linear-elastic rocks. Thus we have been trying to clarify the fundamental mechanism of hydraulic fracturing in unconsolidated formations by laboratory experiments [1-4] and numerical simulations based on the Discrete Element Method [5, 6]. As one of those studies, we have been developing laboratory experimental apparatus to observe the hydraulic fracture behavior by the X-ray CT method. In this study, big improvements have been made recently, and it allows to have CT images of a longitudinal slice of hydraulically induced fracture along the growing direction within an interval of few seconds. This paper will summarize new findings obtained by using the apparatus. |","Document Type

This paper employs the Particle Flow Code in 2 dimensions (PFC2D) to simulate the shear behaviors of rock joints under direct shear tests. A series of rock joints and regular joints with various saw-tooth angles are investigated. The shear resistance - shear displacement relationship, shear strength parameters, crack propagation, and failure modes are observed and investigated. Based on the numerical simulation results and application of the regular joint models, the simulation results compared well with the shear strength models of Patton [3] and Zhang [4] for higher and lower normal stresses but only compared well with the model of Zhang [4] for critical normal stresses. For observation of crack propagation, the initial micro-cracks appeared near the saw-tooth interfaces at 60% ~ 70% of the peak stress state before the peak. Soon, micro-cracks began to propagate into a macro-crack until the stress state reached the peak. The simulated failure modes are compare well with Zhang [4]. This paper further established the chart of the distribution of failure modes based on the saw-tooth angle and the normal stress conditions 
1. INTRODUCTION
Rocks usually accompany inherent discontinuities, including joints, cleavage, and foliation, which were occasioned by tectonic stresses and pressure release. For engineering activities of tunnel excavation and slope stability, a rock joint is one of key components that could lead to tunnel collapse or slope failures during construction. Several factors could influence the mechanical behaviors of a rock joint, i.e., roughness, persistence, wall strength, aperture, and spacing, of which roughness is one of the most important factors for rock sliding.
The natural rock joint geometry never follows a specific regular pattern. Hence, most of the shear strength criteria of a rock joint have been developed by empirical analysis [1-2]. Several scholars simplified the rock joint geometry as a saw-tooth shape and established analytical solutions by observing the results of experimental tests [3-4]. Although shear strength criteria can be developed by experimental tests, the sliding failure process is still difficult to observe. Numerical simulation is one of approaches that can help to understand the failure mechanism, and the use of the discrete element method (DEM) is a magnificent demonstration of this capability [5-13]. To understand the relationship between the joint failure process and its shear strength, a fundamental investigation is required (a simplified joint geometry (saw-tooth), a basic sliding test (direct shear test, DST), and a 2 dimensional numerical analysis were considered). Hence, this paper used the Particle Flow Code in 2 dimensions (PFC2D, a DEM program) to simulate the mechanical behaviors of saw-tooth rock joints under the direct shear test. The shear resistance - shear displacement relation, the shear strength parameters, the crack propagation, and the failure modes will be discussed in this paper. |","Document Type

H., Shell Global Solutions International B.V.","|Abstract|In this contribution, we report on the effect of production-induced reservoir compaction, using core material from a Permian sandstone reservoir located at the Dutch Wadden Sea coastline, at a depth of ~~3700 m TVDMSL. To assess the nature of the compaction mechanisms that operate in these reservoirs, and hence better constrain predictions of subsidence rate and magnitude, we have carried out more than 30 long-term pore pressure depletion tests on sub-samples taken from the extracted core material. Our laboratory data show that pressure depletion results in total strain of 5·10-3 -15·10-3 over the duration of the experiment of 5-12 weeks, with approximately 80% of the total strain response being rapid, and 20% time-dependent. The response is dependent on porosity and stress state, but seems rather insensitive to temperature, and pore fluid composition. Our work shows that while volumetric compaction of the sandstone reservoirs could be responsible for the magnitude of the subsidence observed in the Wadden area, it cannot directly explain the observed temporal relationship between subsidence and reservoir pressure decline, or at least not without some rescaling factor. Instead, other mechanisms such as salt flow or water-leg compaction should also be considered. 
1. INTRODUCTION|Though depletion-induced reservoir compaction is a well-known phenomenon in the hydrocarbon industry, the mechanisms that operate, and the coupling between pressure decline and material response may strongly vary as a function of reservoir depth, composition, basin and production history, and material properties. Pressure solution creep, grain cracking, pore collapse, and shear failure are a number of possible operating mechanisms responsible for accommodating stress changes in the reservoir. In addition to these, upscaling of the response must be achieved in the lateral and stratigraphic directions, to arrive at a bulk description of the strain response, to serve as a means for bounding surface subsidence. Aside from the spatial component, also the temporal aspects must be addressed. In this paper, we report an experimental program that aims at improving our understanding of the magnitudes, and rates, of reservoir compaction related to gas production from Dutch Wadden Sea fields. We specifically report a series of triaxial strength, and long-duration uniaxial-strain pore pressure depletion (UPPD) tests, that enable us to assess the constitutive response of the Permian reservoir rock to production. |","Document Type

The paper describes the principal geomechanical approaches to ensuring stability and integrity in mining salt deposits. The various dimensioning methods usually applied are subjected to a comparative analysis. Geomechanical discontinuum models are identified as essential physical models for examining how the collapse of working fields in potash mining areas can occur. A visco-elasto-plastic material model with strain softening, dilatancy and creep is used to describe the time-dependent softening behaviour of the salt pillars. The pillar stability critically depends on the shear conditions of the bedding planes to the overlying and underlying beds. Therefore, a shear model is introduced, describing interface properties, i.e. velocity-dependent adhesive friction with shear displacement-dependent softening for the bedding planes and discontinuities in the contact zone of the pillars with the surrounding salt rocks. As an outcome, the fundamental mechanical and hydraulic conditions that lead to an integrity loss of saliferous barriers are derived. Several examples of worldwide events of flooded salt mines are back-analysed with coupled hydro-mechanical calculations, demonstrating the prominent role of fluid-pressure-driven generation of hydraulic flow paths as a failure mechanism of saliferous barriers.
1. INTRODUCTION
For a long time, the dimensioning of underground openings in salt rocks was primarily based on mining experience. Only in the last century, analytical and numerical calculation methods of geomechanics have been increasingly used. This was not least due to some catastrophic collapses of mining fields (rock bursts) with a strong mining-induced energy release [1], and the loss of potash and rock salt mines by flooding. Both practical experience and geomechanical calculations are essential for an economical and sustainable salt extraction at high recovery rates and complement each other.
The fundamental requirements of safe dimensioning for potash or rock salt mining are the guarantee of stability of the mining system integrity and protection of the hydraulic protection layers or geological barriers.
For the collapse of mining fields insufficient pillar dimensioning and the brittle fracture behaviour of the mined rock salt played a particularly crucial role [2]. The tendency of brittle fracture decreases from carnallitite, hard salt, trona, sylvinite to rock salt. Therefore, rock bursts occurred primarily in potash mines where carnallitite was mined. In sylvinite and rock salt mines few rock bursts are known worldwide, only if extremely high recovery rate and, accordingly, very slender pillars were realised. The analysis of in situ collapses provides a basis to check dimensioning approaches and to derive empirical relationships for the necessary ratio of pillar width to pillar height (slenderness ratio), which is required ensure the viability and stability of pillars in salt rocks. |","Document Type

Numerical modeling is a standard tool employed on civil engineering projects to simulate complex foundation structure interaction problems, particularly those involving strong seismicity. A key to a representative model is incorporating detailed knowledge of the geologic conditions and an understanding of potential failure modes. During excavation of the stilling basin at the Neelum Jhelum Hydroelectric Project in Pakistan a rock slide undermined the sedimentation basin foundation halting work in the area. A redesigned slope allowed construction to resume. Most important, the post-slide evaluation identified a potential failure mode that had not previously been considered that had the potential to undermine the global stability of the foundation and structures. The ensuing finite element analyses employed jointed material properties to simulate weak discontinuities in the foundation. Sensitivity analyses along with concurrent detailed mapping and monitoring during construction of the new redesigned slope provide greater confidence that global stability is satisfied for this potential failure mode.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Neelum Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (NJHP), located near Muzaffarabad in the state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in northeastern Pakistan, is being developed by the Water & Power Development Authority (WAPDA) of Pakistan. The project, shown on Fig. 1, utilizes a gross hydraulic head of about 430 m by diverting water from the Neelum River with a dam and intake works at Nauseri to the lower branch of the Jhelum River through a 32-kmlong tunnel system and underground powerhouse complex. The installed generating capacity of the project is 968 MW.
The project is divided into three construction lots: Lot C2 includes the headrace tunnel; Lot C3 covers the surge shaft, penstocks, powerhouse complex, and tailrace tunnel; and Lot C1, which is the area of focus in this paper, includes the headworks and the initial segment of the headrace tunnel. Lot C1, shown on Fig. 2, includes a central 56-m high concrete gravity dam with a concrete debris channel and rockfill dam section forming the right abutment. A gated spillway leads to a 100-m-long by 32- m-high stilling basin between El. 986 m and its foundation near El. 954 m. The dam diverts water through the intake structure and a 300-m-long by 76-m-wide sedimentation basin. The sedimentation basin is located immediately west of the stilling basin and is founded at El. 986 m with walls that extend to El. 1019 m. After flowing through the sedimentation basin, the water is routed to the headrace tunnel.|","Document Type

The uniaxial compressive strength data is used in the mine design to develop input parameters for rock mass classification. The purpose of this study is to develop a correlation between the compressive strength and other index tests for various rock units for a proposed mine. The various index tests were performed to develop the compressive strength value to be used in the design of the mine during prefeasibility-level study. The point load tests (PLT), Schmidt Hammer tests (SHT) and density tests were also performed along with uniaxial compressive strength tests (UCS) in order to develop a correlation among the compressive strength and index tests. About 700 point load tests, 155 Schimdt Hammer tests and 70 uniaxial compressive strength tests for rock cores retrieved from the investigation site were performed. The SHT and density tests were performed for all rock cores that were tested for UCS. It was not possible to test the PLT and UCS using the same rock core sample. The PLT tests were performed using both diametral and axial test methods. The point load test data was broadly classified into two categories based on the failure surface. The intact failure strength represented the failure plane through intact rock while structural failure strength represented failure through preexisting bedding, fracture or joint plane.|The rock groups at the site was broadly classified into three (3) rock group category (A-Limestone, B-Weak rocks and C-Breccia) based on point load strength. Only intact failure point load strength data was used to find the relation between PLT and UCS. The point load strength for Breccias was the highest while the same for Weak rocks was the lowest. The mean PLT Is (50) values for three major rock categories Limestone, Weak Rocks and Breccias was 521 psi (pounds per square inch), 232 psi and 1334 psi respectively. The mean rebound number values for three major rock categories Limestone, Weak Rocks and Breccias was 58, 50 and 60 respectively. The relationship between PLT and UCS was established by comparing the mean strength value for each rock group. There is a good relationship found between compressive strength and point load index for Limestone rock group. The ratio of mean UCS to mean PLT for this rock group is 24. This ratio has been presented in the literature for many rock groups. On the other hand the UCS/PLT ratio was found to be 16 for Weak rock and 10 for Breccias. The point load strength from dimetral tests was found to be lower than axial tests. A good relationship is also found between density and UCS. This relationship is nonlinear and is better represented for Breccias. The relation between hammer test and UCS is found to be nonlinear for all rock groups. The correlation between UCS and SHT was not very good.|","Document Type

Geomechanical modelling of stress changes during multi-stage hydraulic fracturing (MSHF) can help optimize the design of hydrocarbon extraction operations in unconventional low permeability low porosity reservoirs. Stress changes which occur during a single stage of MSHF have been known to affect subsequent fracturing stages. If an understanding and modeling capability of the effects of induced stress changes can be achieved, optimization of hydraulic fracture operations becomes feasible. Given uncertainty and limited monitoring data, calibration and history matching with reservoir models are used to help design MSHF operations. Data from “similar” wells to those that will be later encountered are used to create a semi-empirical “model” that may have predictive value in design, but because the basis in physics of such models is weak, their predictive capabilities rapidly disappear if conditions are significantly different from those used to develop the empirical calibration factors.|This paper will examine the stress shadow effects during MSHF in unconventional reservoirs and the possibility of fracture spacing optimization. The study aims to examine previous stress shadow models to identify the most commonly agreed upon effects of stress shadowing, as well as any noted differences in stress changes during different completion methods. Field data is then examined to identify any of these effects, including but not limited to, increase in instantaneous shut in pressure which may indicate an increase in minimum horizontal stress, and fluctuations in treatment pressure which could show stress changes during the fracture propagation.|Both a complex mathematical model and a simple two dimensional model are introduced which will be used to compare efficiency and results in future studies. Recommendations are made concerning simplifying assumptions when it comes to MSHF and reservoir modelling in tight formations.

Massive multistage hydraulic fracturing in low permeability formations using horizontal wells has become one of the most commonly used method to extract natural gas in Canada.

In the stimulation of fractured geothermal reservoirs, injection wellhead pressure, flow rate and microearthquake (MEQ) data are crucial feedbacks recorded in order to characterize the evolution of subsurface fluid flow. However, one of the hurdles to successful EGS development and operation is the lack of reliable evaluation for the initial and evolving hydraulic properties of the fractured reservoir. Specific spatial conditions (e.g., location and direction) of fracture permeability in the field are vital in defining reservoir response during stimulation and then production. To constrain the evolving permeability, we propose a model that maps the in-situ permeability based onto the Oda crack tensor using the moment magnitude of individual MEQs, assuming that the induced seismicity is controlled by the Mohr-Coulomb shear criterion. The MEQ catalog of locations, fault plane solutions, and moment magnitudes are used to estimate fracture apertures of individual events/fractures that are a dynamic function of in-situ stress, fluid pressure, shear displacement and fracture size. The corresponding in-situ 2D permeability tensors are computed and mapped at various scales within the reservoir. Results suggest that the permeability magnitude largely depends on MEQ moment magnitude and fracture frictional properties while permeability direction is dominantly controlled by fracture orientation. However, uncertainty remains within the results, which need improvements in constraint from laboratory and in-situ fracture characterization, the quality of seismic monitoring and reliability of appropriate assumptions.
1. INTRODUCTION 
Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are engineered reservoirs created to recover the geothermal resource from high temperature but low permeability rock formations. In general, the creation and operation of an EGS project comprises two phases. In the first phase, the reservoir is stimulated to generate sufficient permeability through hydroshearing of pre-existing fractures in the reservoir [1]. During stimulation, elevated fluid pressures induce microearthquakes (MEQs) by decreasing the effective normal stresses on the fracture planes. As microseismic events provide valuable feedback to the stimulation, microseismic monitoring is one of the most effective ways to characterize the underlying active processes and the evolution of permeability in the reservoir. This is accomplished through the use of moment tensors derived for the events [2]. Moment tensors, in turn, may be mathematically interpreted to estimate the geometry of the fracture zone, the orientation of fracture planes and the dynamics of fracture development. In the second phase, a production well is subsequently planned and optimally accommodated according to the monitored spatial distribution of MEQs in order to maximize thermal production. Although there is wide agreement that microseismicity may signal the enhancement of permeability in EGS reservoirs (Figure 1(a)) and it has become a method to optimally locate a production well, the quantification of the assumed enhancement and the physical connections between MEQ data and spatial permeability distribution and evolution are not well constrained.|","Document Type

Since the formation of the International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) Commission on Underground Research Laboratory (URL) Networking in 2011, we have attended and organized URL-related meetings. During 2013 -2014, the gatherings of Commissioners include the 3rd SINOROCK, 47th ARMA symposium, 13th TAUP (Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics) conference, 2013 AGU annual fall meeting, 2013 EUROCK symposium, 4thiDUST (inter-Disciplinary Underground Science and Technology) conference, and the 8th ARMS (Asia Rock Mechanics Symposium). The 2015 planned activities include the 4th URL Workshop associated with the 13th ISRM Congress. Recent progress in planned heater tests in radioactive waste URLs, designs of large excavations in deep physics facilities, and other underground studies are reviewed in this article. Rock mechanics findings and multi-disciplinary studies are among topics of interest to the ISRM Commission. Heater tests for better understanding of the coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes are of interest to radioactive repository assessments and for other thermal storage and geothermal production projects. Large excavations in physics laboratories are driven by the needs associated with designing and housing next generation of experiments to detect rare events. Some existing physics laboratories are interested to use available spaces for geo-sciences studies, including microbiological research for deep life. We review the progress in these topics and welcome inputs on case histories and planned developments in URLs. The inputs from the geo-engineering and rock mechanics communities are essential for our continuing efforts of the ISRM URL Networking Commission..
1. INTRODUCTION 
An Underground Research Laboratory (URL) Workshop was held on September 11, 2011, in Beijing, China, in association with the 12th International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) Congress. This was the 3rd URL Workshop, and it follows the 1st URL Workshop on 2003 in Johannesburg [1] and the 2nd URL Workshop on 2007 in Lisbon. This 3rd URL Workshop had 22 lectures in 5 sessions. The ISRM URL Networking Commission was formed after this URL Workshop. In this paper, we reviewed primarily presentations in meetings after the 3rd URL Workshop. An early literature review was presented at the 2010 ARMS in New Delhi [2] of URL activities before the 3rd URL Workshop. An overview of the 3rd URL Workshop lectures and other subsequent meeting sessions in following years are presented in 2015 in the 13th ISRM Congress [3]. Underground studies have been conducted primarily either to evaluate the capacities of different formations to isolate wastes or to explore resources at depths. Many researches are conducted in sites for radioactive waste assessments to project over geological time scales, for physics detectors for rare event detections, for multi-disciplinary collaborations, and for energy resources productions and for environmental isolations. For the ISRM URL Networking Commission, we use the term URL for any facility dedicated to all these research activities. We focus on recent advances in understanding various processes conducted in URLs. The ISRM URL Networking Commission dedicates to evaluate these studies in various workshops and meetings, including the series of Asian Rock Mechanics Symposia (ARMS), EUROCK annual meetings, regional ISRM-sponsored symposia, American Geophysical Union (AGU) meetings, American Physical Society (APS) meetings, and other topical meetings organized after 2011. We focus on recent advances in understanding various processes conducted in URLs, and on known plans and designs for expansions.|","Document Type

The attenuation characteristics of compressional (P) and shear (S) waves in dry water, and varyingly saturated brine (10, 20 and 30% NaCl by weight) saturated Hawkesbury sandstone samples were measured in the laboratory within the ultrasonic frequency range of 0.1-1.5MHz. The results were analyzed using the pulse transmission technique and spectral ratios were used to calculate the attenuation coefficient and quality factor (Q). The values were calculated relative to a reference sample of aluminium with negligible attenuation, and the effect of salinity on the attenuation characteristics of sandstone was evaluated. Velocity dispersion was observed for both P and S waves for all the tested conditions. It is observed that the attenuation coefficient is frequency-dependent, and the attenuation coefficient of the tested sandstone is linearly proportional to frequency for both P and S waves. Interestingly, with respect to dry value, the attenuation coefficient increases with the fluid saturation (both water and brine). Moreover, the calculated Q values reveal that the values are highly dependent on saturation condition, and reduce with saturation. Varyingly saturated brine (10, 20 and 30% of NaCl) was then used to simulate the brine saturation effect. According to the results, although the sample saturated with 10% NaCl had similar attenuation characteristics to the water-saturated sample, 20 and 30% NaCl saturated samples displayed considerable variations in attenuation coefficient and quality factor, where the attenuation coefficient decreases with increasing salinity level of the pore fluid and consequently, the quality factor of the rock formation is also increased. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) in geological reservoirs is one of the best ways to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emission into the atmosphere. It is now well accepted that CO2 geo-sequestration in deep saline aquifers can accommodate large amounts of captured anthropogenic CO2 compared to other geological reservoirs [1, 2] such as depleted oil/gas and coal formations. Generally, the most preferable saline aquifers are of sandstone and most are highly saline [3]. During long-term injection in CO2 sequestration, the reservoir undergoes different mineralogical reactions, including the dissolution and precipitation of rock minerals, which in turn alter the hydro-mechanical properties of the formation. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the possible changes in the hydro-mechanical properties of undisturbed formations before initiating the injection process. |","Document Type

In order to reveal the stress shadow effect and its influencing factors in the processing of segregated fracturing in horizontal wells, this paper provides a novel fracture propagation model to simulate multiple hydraulic fracture propagation from a horizontal wellbore. The model couples fracture deformation with fluid flow in the fractures and the horizontal wellbore, includes frictional pressure drop, perforation limited entry, and flow distribution for each fracture. The finite difference method and the finite element method are respectively adopted to simulate fluid flow in fractures and the rock deformation. Meanwhile, Picard iteration method is used to solve the coupled model. The calculation results show that stress shadow do exist, which affects the deformation and propagation of cracks. Because the internal perforation clusters are strongly compressed by the both lateral cracks, the internal crack growth is restrained and the fracture length and width are both small. The intensity of the stress shadow is closely related to perforating cluster spacing, the elastic modulus of rock and so on. The greater the elastic modulus of rock and the smaller the perforating cluster spacing are, the more obvious the interference between the fractures is. Under the same condition, the stress shadow interference between clusters can be alleviated and the extension of the main fracture can also be promoted by injecting low-viscosity fracturing fluids at large flow rate. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Horizontal well staged fracturing is one of the key technologies for the development of shale gas, tight gas and other unconventional reservoirs. Mainly through the applications of the staged perforating technology, low viscosity fracturing fluid and steering materials, multiple branch fractures are induced while the main fracture is propagating, which connects the natural fractures. Hence, complex fracture networks occur, which improve the flow channels and then the ultimate recovery of oil and gas. In recent years, with the continuous improvement of composite bridge plug + multi-cluster perforation staged fracturing process, the scale and number of segments of reservoir reconstruction are increasingly large. However, the existing mine practice shows that the small cluster spacing will lead to a considerable number of clusters that are unable to form an effective crack [1]. The presence of these invalid cracks not only dramatically reduce the efficiency of fracturing, but also result in high operation pressure, sand plugging and other engineering problems, which sometimes can even cause failure of the entire fracturing operation. Currently, the optimization problems of segments within the cluster spacing have been studied by some scholars. But these researches are mainly focused on the relationship between the cluster spacing and the optimization of production capacity.|","Document Type

Laboratory and field studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between the volume of proppant deployed in hydraulic fracturing operations and subsequent reservoir productivity. In recent years, the desire to improve proppant performance has led to the development of new generations of exotic proppants, as well as new propping strategies. Nevertheless, the factors controlling performance of even traditional proppants in real rock fractures are poorly understood. Improved models are needed to help devise optimal strategies for deploying traditional and new varieties of proppant.|Large-scale proppant models frequently rely on empirical closure relationships to represent real-world transport behavior. However, care must be taken when applying such relationships outside their derived context. In particular, most models employ closure relationships determined for slurries where the fluid dimensions vastly exceed the particle size. This is not true for fracture flow, where wall effects alter the effective transport properties and introduce new interaction forces.|This paper describes an ongoing study employing a combination of high fidelity numerical simulations and fracture-scale experiments to describe the transport properties of proppant particles in fractures. The experimental work examines proppant movement in clearplastic three-dimensional reproductions of the shale surfaces recreated using three dimensional printing. These specially tailored flow cells are used in combination with micro-capsules for improved particle tracking in dense particle packs. The same shale surfaces are also employed in high-resolution particulate flow simulations in which both the particles and interstitial fluid motion are explicitly represented. The data gathered from these experiments and simulations are used to help constrain models of settling and dispersion in particle-laden fluids within fractures.
1. INTRODUCTION
Correct proppant placement is key to maintaining fracture permeability following hydraulic stimulation of geological resources, in particular, stimulation of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. Laboratory studies have demonstrated improvements of several orders of magnitude in the permeability of propped versus unpropped fractures [1], while analysis of production rates in the field show a strong correlation between the amount of proppant introduced and production rates observed in the field [2, 3]. Nevertheless, the nature of proppant transport in natural fractures is poorly understood. Completed wells, for example, can experience flowback of more than 10% of the injected proppant and proppant concentration schedules are often determined through trial and error, rather than design [4, 5, 6]. The desire to improve proppant performance has lead to the proliferation of a wide variety of propping strategies. These include the development of lower density proppants to reduce settling rates and improve transport in low viscosity fluids, and the development of strategies employing multiple modal proppant size distributions to improve propping at the fracture tip. Elsewhere cyclic pumping and variable proppant concentrations are employed in an effort to create heterogeneous proppant deposition [7]. These strategies are not without risk: mixing of proppants of different size can result in a reduction in permeability; low density proppants are more susceptible to flow back and are more costly than traditional proppants; and uncertainties surrounding dispersion characteristics hinders heterogeneous proppant deployment. Without accurate models of proppant transport the correct deployment and efficacy of such strategies is a matter of conjecture|","Document Type

Most of the onshore oil fields in south Mexico are characterized by complex geology in Tertiary and Mesozoic rocks. This paper presents a field case where a well was drilled in a very highly fractured and faulted zone with a nonproductive time due to wellbore instability issues of 182 hours and a high potential to execute a sidetrack. A 1D Mechanical Earth Model was built, followed up with Logging While Drilling tools, cavings morphology monitoring and 3D caliper analysis.

After mitigation measures were implemented was possible to run in hole to continue drilling up to the 7 inches casing point at 5250 meters. Logs were run, and it was evaluated the borehole shape that allowed to prove the effectiveness of proper mitigation measures, avoiding continued mechanical degradation of the borehole stability in the overlying section. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Many of the oil fields onshore southern Mexico are characterized by complex geology in Tertiary and Mesozoic rocks. This require the drilling of high complexity wells through highly faulted and fractured zones, overpressured sections and depleted reservoirs. The presence of tight hole, torque and drag, excessive cavings production and stuck pipe events are typical. Therefore the drilling processes present nonproductive time (NPT) due to additional wiper trips, excessive reaming and back reaming operations and undesirable side tracks with high impact in the final operation costs.
This is a field case where a well was drilled in a very highly fracture and faulted zone, which after drilled to 4500 meters and pulled out of hole for a wiper trip, was very difficult to reach the bottom hole due to several high torques, tight hole events and stuck pipe attempts in the interval from 4300 to 4000 meters. The NPT due to wellbore instability issues, reached 182 hours with an operation cost of USD 132,000 and high potential of execute a sidetrack. |","Document Type

Engineering for design and construction of safe and reliable high pressure water tunnel systems requires good knowledge of in situ stress conditions of the rock mass to evaluate confinement and potential for hydraulic jacking to occur. Without adequate confinement, an impermeable lining system would be required, typically consisting of steel-lining. Considerable importance is placed during investigations in obtaining reliable rock stress information for selection of an appropriate and safe lining system. Various methods are used, including standardized hydraulic fracturing, hydraulic jacking testing, and over-coring. With each of these there are limitations in providing reliable data in a cost effective and efficient way. A modified approach to hydrojacking testing is described that has been used successfully on hydropower projects in the Himalayas and Andes where other more traditional methods have been unproductive. It involves use of modern water pressure test and grouting equipment, often available in-country or already under contract on a construction project. Lower costs and rapidity of testing permit more data to be collected than would otherwise be achieved, resulting in significant benefits. This approach is becoming increasingly common but which possibly suffers from not being sufficiently recognized in the profession or properly standardized so as to gain universal acceptance. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In the planning and design of a pressurized water tunnel system, it is imperative to have knowledge of the ability of a rock mass to withstand leakage of high-pressure water from waterways that are not equipped with totally impervious liners. It is well understood in our profession that all shotcrete, plain concrete, or reinforced concrete linings should be considered as pervious since they will crack due to shrinkage and the effects of internal pressure. Reinforcement added to shotcrete and concrete will assist in the control and distribution of cracks but will not eliminate them. Schleiss points out that when a lining is pervious, seepage will flow into the surrounding rock mass through cracks, joints, or fractures, with the result that the internal water pressure will exert a load not only on the inner surface of the lining but also within the rock mass itself [1]. As long as the natural stresses in the rock mass exceed the seepage pressures contributing to the hydraulic forces within the rock mass, the load-bearing capacity of the rock will not be exceeded. In this condition, the rock mass is said to provide adequate confinement. However, if the water pressure in a given rock fracture exceeds the existing normal stress, the fracture will dilate and the water pressure will be transmitted further into the rock mass. This failure mode, known as hydrojacking, can result in an unacceptable and uncontrolled water loss and potential for serious damage to surrounding structures, undesirable changes in the water table, or possible surface slope stability issues. |","Document Type

Here, we present (1) tomography images of the seismic velocity (Vp, Vs) and attenuation (Qp, Qs) built from microseismic data recorded before injection and during the first 60 days of injection, (2) the spatiotemporal distribution of the microseismicity over 270 days of injection, and (3) a 3D thermo-hydro-mechanical modeling of the EGS. The results show the development of a seismically quiet domain around the injection well surrounded by a seismically active domain. The modeling with comparison to field data indicates that the seismically quite (aseismic) domain is due to the presence of the injected cold water. Thermal processes cause a cooling-stress reduction preventing shear reactivation. This process is accompanied by aseismic plastic shear strain, which can be interpreted as slow slip events. In the seismic domain, microseismicity is caused by the reactivation of the preexisting fractures due to injection-induced pressure increases in steam pressure. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Injecting fluid into a rock formation reduces the effective stress and can lead to brittle failure [1]. Such fracture reactivation can be accompanied by microseismic events due to the release of preexisting tectonic stresses. The monitoring of microseismic activity can provide valuable information concerning the response of the reservoir to water injection. The occurrence of microseismicity at a point remote from the injection interval indicates that the point has a hydraulic connection to the borehole interval. However, it does not necessarily mean that significant fluid flow occurs along the connection [2]. Moreover, during the reservoir stimulation, aseismic deformations can play an important role on the reservoir development during hydraulic stimulation [3]. 
In this paper, we present data collected during the Northwest Geysers EGS Demonstration project [4,5]. The project aims to develop an EGS by directly and systematically injecting cool water at relatively low pressure into a vapor-dominated geothermal reservoir with temperatures up to 400 °C. We focus our study on the relationship between the formation of the liquid saturated zone and the distribution of the seismic and aseismic deformations. First, we present the Northwest Geysers EGS Demonstration project, a 3-D seismic tomography performed during the first months of injection and the microseismic activity by using the Seismicity-Based Reservoir Characterization approach [6, 7]. Finally, we discuss our observations with the results of a 3-D Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) numerical model simulation of the EGS area. |","Document Type

Salt is usually added to oil well cement systems to overcome compatibility issues between well cements and salt containing formations as well as salt related durability issues with cement sheath. Several studies on the impact of adding salt to oil well cement have been documented in the literature; however, the impact of compression on salt cement sheath such as during hydraulic fracturing has not been fully investigated. This study focuses on investigating the impact of compression (cement’s compaction) on the petrophysical and mechanical properties of wellbore cement containing salt and their potential impact on long term wellbore integrity issues. A unique bench-scale physical model, which utilizes expandable tubulars, was used to simulate the compaction of a previously cemented casing under field-like conditions. The impact of the compression on the cement’s petrophysical and mechanical properties were quantified by measuring the porosity, permeability and hardness of 1in x 2in cores drilled parallel to the orientation of the pipe from the compacted cement sheath. The acquired results indicate that the compaction of the cement sheath resulted in a reduction in porosity and permeability of the cement sheath and an increase in the hardness of the cement sheath after compaction. Furthermore, the results confirm reduction in the detrimental effect of salt on the strength and stiffness of the cement after compaction..
1. INTRODUCTION
Cementing forms an integral part and is often regarded as one of the most critical steps in oil well completions. It is used to fill the annulus between the casing and the formation and between two consecutive casing strings. The main objectives for cementing oil-wells are to isolate the well from its surrounding in order to prevent fluid migration, protect the casing from corrosion and provide mechanical support for the casing string. The properties of the cement slurry and its behavior depend on the components and additives of the cement slurry design [1]. As a result of the development of offshore fields and drilling activities through salt formations, seawater has become widely used for cementing purposes especially in the US Gulf of Mexico with well-known massive salt formations often in excess of 10, 000ft thickness [2]. There are several reasons for adding salt to oil well cement such as more desirable mechanical properties, better compatibility with salt formations and offsetting of bulk hydration shrinkage. However, salt could adversely affect admixture performance and lower the ultimate compressive strength of the cement [3]. Calcium chlorides in particular, have been used to shorten cements’ setting time and calcium chloride and sodium chloride to a lesser extent have been shown to leach calcium hydroxide leading to chemical changes in the cement resulting in loss of strength and corrosion of the casing [4]. The presence of salt in oil well cements presents a danger to the cement. Although the exact mechanism of salt damage to oil well cement have not been fully understood, it has been shown that salt, which is a mild acid, lowers the pH of the cement and attracts more water into the pore structure of the cement leaving room for expansion leading to fracture initiation and propagation [4]. |","Document Type

R., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory| Ryerson, F. J., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","|Abstract
When a hydraulic fracture intersects a natural fracture in 3D space, even if the conditions for direct crossing in 2D are not met, the hydraulic fracture can still “bypass” the natural fracture by propagating through the rock medium surrounding the natural fracture. We have investigated conditions under which a hydraulic fracture intersects a smaller natural fracture oriented perpendicular to the hydraulic fracture, and find in this reduced-order geometry that if the natural fracture only covers part of the fracturable domain height and is not filled with a tough cementitious material, the result will be an intersection geometry identical to that of a direct crossing. For the scenario with tough cementitious filling and moderate rock-filling interface strength, we study the development of tensile stress in the filling by modeling a laboratory experiment and extend the model to field-scale. The results show that as long as the cementitious material is relatively thin and the interfaces between it and the rock matrix have moderate frictional strength, sufficiently high tensile stress always develops during the bypassing process to break the filling material, also creating an intersection geometry identical to direct crossing. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Natural rock formations are ubiquitously fractured, and the intersections between a propagating hydraulic fracture and natural fractures play a very important role in determining the connectivity of the stimulated fracture network. The intersecting process between a hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture has been extensively studied in the literature [1-3], and various criteria concerning whether the hydraulic fracture will cross, be arrested by, or be offset by the natural fracture have been developed. These studies were mostly carried out in the two-dimensional (2D) space. It was realized, more recently, that certain intersection modes, such as bypassing, which we describe in the next section, are unique to 3D space and inapplicable to 2D. Using a fully coupled 3D model for hydraulic fracturing, the current study investigates the fundamental mechanism of bypassing and the conditions under which it takes place. |","Document Type

Compressional and shear waves propagated across single fractures are sensitive to the size and distributions of voids and contact area in a fracture. Fracture geometry is often altered by geochemical reactions among pore fluids and rock. In this study, acoustic monitoring was performed while two chemical solutions were flowed into a fracture to induce chemical precipitation. Mineral precipitation along the fracture plane was not uniform and significant gas bubble evolution occurred during the chemical invasion. Compressional wave amplitudes were significantly affected by the size and distribution of gas bubbles. Once the chemical invasion was halted, bubble formation was minimized but the redistribution of bubbles still occurred. Transmitted wave amplitudes increased in regions with significant amounts of mineral precipitation. The detection of mineral precipitation within a fracture is possible but requires an understanding of the effect of each component that arises from reactive flow on acoustic signals. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Fractures in the Earth’s subsurface are subjected to natural and induced physical processes that alter a fracture. For example, a change in stress on a fracture deforms the void geometry and affects the amount of contact area between the two fracture surfaces. Geochemical reactions between pore fluids and the host rock also alter fracture void geometry through dissolution and mineral precipitation. The ability to detect and monitor alterations to fractures using geophysical methods requires a link between a measured geophysical response and a property (or properties) of the fracture.|Compressional and shear waves propagated across single fractures are sensitive to the size and distributions of voids and contact area in a fracture [1, 2]. The complexity of this fracture topology is captured by fracture specific stiffness which is an effective parameter that captures the deformed state of a fracture topology under stress [1, 3]. Fracture specific stiffness increases with an increase in contact area and a decrease in fracture aperture [4-7]. Normal and shear fracture specific stiffness are used in many theoretical and numerical approaches to wave propagation in fractured media to represent the complexity of fracture topology (for example see: [8-14]). From the theory for single fractures, an increase in fracture stiffness results in an increase in transmitted wave amplitude and a decrease in group time delay. Few studies have examined the effect of chemical alteration of fractures on fracture stiffness and/or elastic wave transmission [15]. In this study, we examined the effect of mineral precipitation in a fracture on compressional wave transmission to determine the effect of geochemically altering fracture void geometry. |","Document Type

In this paper, the three dimensional Particle Flow Code (PFC3D) with a newly developed contact model which can properly consider the contribution of moment to contact normal and shear stresses and the condition at which the contact bond fails was used to investigate the cracking process of rocks containing single flaws and under uniaxial compression. The new contact model was first validated by using it to simulate the experimental cracking process of gypsum containing pre-existing single flaws at different inclination angles. Then the influence of flaw shape (length and thickness) on the cracking process was systematically studied and the key features were identified based on the simulations. The results indicate that the first cracks (usually called primary cracks) initiate from the boundary of the pre-existing flaw and are always caused by tensile failure, and the secondary cracks first emanate from the tips of the pre-existing flaw due to shear failure and then develop to a mixed shear and tensile cracking zone. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The initiation, propagation and coalescence of cracks dominate the deformability and strength of rock. Therefore, extensive experimental and theoretical research has been conducted on the cracking process of rock. The cracking process of samples containing flaws under uniaxial compressive loading provides insightful understanding of the cracking of natural rocks and thus has been studied extensively by researchers using rocks and manmade materials. The term flaws refer to preexisting cracks or holes in the rock specimens. The results indicate that tensile wing cracks are always found to be the first cracks to initiate from the flaw boundary and continued loading leads to initiation of a secondary group of cracks that may be a combination of tensile and shear cracks. However, the types and mechanisms of the new cracks that developed after the tensile wing cracks are often hard to be categorized, and the stress field inside the specimen is never fully revealed [1]. Most researchers simply describe them as secondary cracks without implying the mode of crack initiation. In this way the first cracks are commonly referred as primary cracks. So the words “primary” and “secondary” simply imply a temporal relationship.|","Document Type

Among the rock mass properties, deformation modulus of rock mass (Em) is important for implementation and successful execution of rock engineering projects. The direct field measurements of modulus determination is costive and sometimes difficult to execute; however indirect estimation of the modulus using regression based statistical methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic (FL) systems are recently employed. Despite the extensive application of ANN and FL in rock mass properties estimation, they are also associated with some disadvantages. In order to improve FL performance, it is possible to incorporate it to ANN. Therefore, adaptive neuro-fuzzy system (ANFIS) was presented. In this system, ANN is used to learn fuzzy rules. However, some parameters of ANN which are left should be optimized. As ANN is structured within the ANFIS, finding the optimum architecture of ANFIS will be very time-consuming via a trial-and-error approach. This study focuses on the efficiency of the genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimum ANFIS structure and its application to predict the deformation modulus of rock mass. GA is utilized to find the optimal number of membership function, the learning rates and the momentum coefficients and to select the input variables. The results are then compared with those of trial-and-error procedure. A database including 188 data sets from six dam sites in Zagros Mountains in Iran was employed using the purpose method. It has been shown that the hybrid ANFIS-GA model has higher accuracy than the trial-and-error model for estimation of Em. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The deformation modulus has an important effect for designing and successful execution of rock engineering projects. The deformation modulus is the best representative parameter of the pre-failure mechanical behavior of the rock material and of a rock mass .The deformation modulus is therefore a cornerstone base of many geomechanical analyses [1].
There are several methods to determine the deformation modulus directly, including field or in situ tests. The plate jacking, plate loading, radial jacking, flat jack and cable jack are the most common in situ tests for modulus estimation. However, difficulties may be encountered during the in situ tests for example there are expensive and time consuming [2].|","Document Type

G., University of Calgary","|Abstract|The existence of structuration in natural clays and shales is believed to change their stiffness, yielding, dilatancy and strength; the components that are widely accepted to unite with those of the reconstituted parent soil upon large straining. However, some experimental results show that this unification may not occur in either isotropic/one-dimensional compression characteristics and/or critical state friction angle. From the constitutive modeling point of view the former can be captured with many existing models while the latter has been barely introduced in constitutive models of natural geomaterials. Based on the experimental observation on the Colorado shale, the present study aims at introducing the structured critical state friction angle in the constitutive model of Nakai et al (2011). A new internal variable is introduced to capture irreversible degradation of the structured critical state line in the stress space. Model simulations of lab experimental tests on Colorado shale are presented in order to show the improved predictive capabilities of the new model. 
1. INTRODUCTION|Natural clays and shales generally develop a complex structure as a result of physicochemical and mechanical processes during their sedimentation and postsedimentation history. The term structure, therefore, refers innately to the combined effects of fabric and interparticle bonding caused by cementation, aging or, more generally, digenesis, [1]. However, following the suggestion of Leroueil and Vaughan [2] the term ""structured"" soil have been widely used in the literature to refer to the effects of bonding, of any origin, which upon removal by plastic straining or remolding will create the parent ""destructured"" soil. In this paper, terms ""structuration"" and ""destructuration"" will be used in the former and the latter sense, respectively. |As compared to that of destructured clays, the engineering behavior of structured clays have been shown to possess: 1) larger yield stresses than those merely induced by the stress history, 2) higher stiffness and shear strength although being accompanied with a bigger void ratio and 3) brittle behavior with a sudden post-peak decrease of the shear strength, e.g. see [2–4]. Although many experimental studies show that these characteristics gradually unite with those of the parent soil upon destructuration, e.g. [2,3], some other experimental results show that this unification may not take place in one-dimensional/isotropic compression tests, depending on the predominance of the interparticle bonding and the range of applied stresses/strains, e.g. see [5,6]. Interestingly, this non-unification has been reported even for the friction angle at the critical state condition under which the soil is exposed to a large shearing displacement and interparticle bonds are expected to be greatly damaged; e.g. see [6–8]. Performing triaxial compression tests on intact, destructured and remolded samples of Saint-Jean- Vianney clay, Saihi et al [7] attributed increased critical friction angle to the degree of destructuration at the beginning of the test, i.e. the more the volumetric strain during consolidation is, the less the difference between the critical structured and destructured friction angles will be. The micro-mechanical interpretation of the latter can be linked, to some extent, to the anisotropy of the bond breakage, that is, not all bonds break when the bond yield is initiated, [9]. In other words, a number of strongly cemented clusters of particles may not be destroyed even at the critical state, and hence create more irregularly shaped pseudo-particles which increase the critical friction angle.|","Document Type

This paper presents a strategy where two commercial simulators: CMG-STARS and FLAC2D are linked together and jointly executed for thermal-stress-fluid analyses during the steam-assisted gravity drainage process. These simulation results are subsequently used to compute the safety factor against tensile failure within the caprock. A novel technique is described and implemented to also compute the safety factor against shear failure. The results clearly show that the safety factors against both tensile and shear failure will decrease as the steam chambers develop within the reservoir. Selection of material strength properties of the caprock is a critical factor in the defensible selection of an operating factor of safety at a given maximum steam injection pressure. Injection pressures, well pair spacing and caprock thickness also have remarkable impact on caprock safety. The methodology presented in this paper can be used to rationalize tensile/shear failure factors of safety for caprock integrity and be used as a criterion for the control of steam injection pressure to prevent caprock failure and steam leakage. 
1. INTRODUCTION
According to the Alberta Department of Energy, there are 167.2 billion barrels of remaining established reserves in the oil sands deposits of Northern Alberta. Approximately 80% of oil sands are recoverable through in-situ production, with only 20% recoverable by mining. Recovery rate percentages vary depending on the method of extraction but over the past several decades, cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) have been the commercial in situ recovery technologies of choice. For the shallower oil sands deposits (e.g. depths less than 300 m), SAGD methods have been the in situ recovery method of choice. For SAGD recovery process, pair of vertically adjacent wells is drilled horizontally within the oil sands reservoir; the upper well serves as the steam injection well and the lower well serves as the production well. Ideally, they lie directly above one another separated by approximately 5m. Once heated by steam, the lower viscous bitumen flows to the production well as a result of gravity forces. |","Document Type

In Korea, damage from the collapse of artificial slopes along national highways has significantly decreased due to the continuous survey and preparation of measures for the last 17 years, while casualties and property damage from the occurrence of debris flow at the valley parts of natural mountain area have rapidly increased. Accordingly, the necessity of the debris flow management for natural mountain area that is similar to the artificial slope management has been suggested at a national level.
In this study, specific sections vulnerable to debris flow damage were selected, and a complete enumeration survey was performed for the sections with debris flow hazards. Based on this, the characteristics of the sections with debris flow hazards and the current status of actions against debris flow were examined, and an efficient installation plan for a debris flow damage prevention method that is required in the future was suggested.
The results indicated that in the Route 56 section where the residential density is relatively higher between the two model survey sections, facilities for debris flow damage reduction were insufficient compared to those in the Route 6 section which is a mountain area. It is thought that several sites require urgent preparation of a facility for debris flow damage reduction. In addition, a numerical analysis showed that for a check dam installed as a debris flow damage prevention method, distributed installation of a number of small-scale check dam facilities within a valley part was more effective than single installation of a large-scale check dam at the lower part of a valley.

Since the introduction of the point load test, size effect has been observed in the point load strength index. While considerable research has been undertaken to investigate the size effect in the point load strength index, and the general cause of size effect, there has been limited research applying size effect theories to the size effect observed in the point load strength index. This paper investigates the applicability of size effect models including SEL, MFSL, Brook Model and FFSEL to both axial and diametral point load strength indexes at varying sample length to diameter ratios. In addition, the size effect at varying length to diameter ratios of a point load strength index which incorporates the contact area between the loading pointer and the sample has also been investigated.|Through an experimental investigation of both axial and diametral point load tests involving 374 samples of Gosford sandstone, this investigation found that the point load strength index varies increasingly with sample diameter for all investigated samples at different length to diameter ratios. The SEL and MFSL size effect models best fitted to the size effect trend of Gosford sandstone results obtained through axial point loading. However, when the contact area was included then the point load strength index found to increase with sample diameter for all investigated length to diameter ratios. The FFSEL size effect accurately modelled the increasing trend of Gosford sandstone results under both axial and diametral conditions across all length to diameter ratios. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The point load test is widely used within geotechnical and rock engineering in the classification of rock. Due to the low cost and portability of the test unit, it is commonly used within the mining industry to classify intact rock strength for use in rock mass classification systems such as the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) or Q systems [1]. Knowledge of intact rock strength and the rock mass classification is a fundamental input for geotechnical design and also is a parameter for selecting mining method. Accurate classification of intact rock strength is critical for the accurate classification of rock mass which is necessary for the development of safe geotechnical and mine designs.
Since the introduction of the point load test, a size effect has been observed in the test results where the measured rock strength varies increasingly with sample size. This effect can have a significant impact on the classification of intact rock strength. Considerable research has been conducted to investigate the size effect in the point load test with previous research finding that point load results vary with sample diameter and sample length to diameter ratio [2-6]. This research has led to the introduction of sample size requirements for the point load test.|","Document Type

D., The University of New South Wales| Suorineni, F. T., The University of New South Wales| Hebblewhite, B. K., The University of New South Wales","|Abstract
Block caving is an underground mining method that enables profitable extraction of massive, low-grade orebodies, provided orebody geometry, size and competence (quality) favors caving. The use of the block cave mining method is increasing in popularity as it is the lowest cost underground mining method and it enables large production rates. Despite the trend towards block cave mining, the method still faces several challenges. Improved understanding of how a rockmass responds to caving will lead to safer, more predictable and more productive cave mining operations. Combining large datasets from multiple sources with virtual reality scientific visualization (VRSV) is a viable alternative to understanding complex cave behavior without access to the cave. The block caving mining system is complex due to multiple interrelating factors and it is vital that the block cave mining system is analyzed holistically, rather than optimizing individual factors in isolation. The block cave mining system visualizer (BCMSV) software module was developed within the School of Mining Engineering at the University of New South Wales to harness VRSV for this purpose. The back analysis of Newcrest Mining Limited’s Ridgeway Deeps operation using the BCMSV enabled the phenomenon of pulses in the rate of seismic activity to be identified in the active region of cave propagation. Capturing these regions with seismic space-time sequences (SSTS) led to further analysis into the source mechanisms. Orientation analysis of SSTS damage volumes has enabled active joint sets in critical areas of cave propagation to be correlated to the SSTS, suggesting that the seismicity is related to joint activity. This observation is supported by numerical modelling results and seismic property analysis. The potential exists for the location of SSTS events to be used within the management cycle of a block caving operation to provide an indication of the critically stressed region of the caving column, where cave propagation is likely migrating. Engineering/geology teams can also utilize the contained SSTS orientation information for quickly imaging the rockmass fabric response to stress change to identify the caving mechanisms dominant within that damage volume. |","Document Type

Many natural gas reservoirs are characterized by large networks of pre-existing natural fractures. To design hydraulic fracturing treatments in these systems, models are needed that can account for the complex interaction of hydraulic fractures with natural fracture networks. This work presents a new method for modeling hydraulic fracturing in these reservoirs using an algorithm based on the discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA). To demonstrate the method’s capabilities, hydraulic fracturing is simulated in two theoretical pre-fractured reservoirs subjected to different levels of background stress. The results of this work demonstrate that principal stress will be one of the primary factors determining the direction of fracture propagation within a naturally fractured system. In addition, the orientation of the natural fracture networks will also influence the direction of fracture propagation, particularly when the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stress is minimal. Finally, the results demonstrate that fluid viscosity and injection rate will have a direct impact on the extent to which fracturing fluid will invade a pre-existing network of natural fractures, but only a minimal impact on the direction taken by propagating hydraulic fractures. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
In the field, natural gas reservoirs are frequently characterized by large networks of pre-existing natural fractures. Hydraulic fracturing treatments for these reservoirs are often designed using bi-wing or radial fracturing models, both of which are based on strict assumptions for the geometry of the propagating fracture [1, 2]. The presence of pre-existing natural fractures, however, can lead to the formation of complex fracture networks which are not well characterized by these models [3]. In addition, natural fractures can cause the flow and production properties of a targeted reservoir to deviate greatly from those predicted by bi-wing or radial fracture models. Given the potential impact of natural fractures on hydraulic fracture propagation and reservoir production, the study of fracturing in naturally fractured reservoirs deserves further attention.|","Document Type

Elastic parameters of rocks are typically used for design purposes in open pit and underground mining, underground spaces and rock-cutting projects. However, the ultimate strength of rocks is strongly influenced by their micro-fractures, preexisting cracks, and anisotropy due to inhomogeneity, discontinuities, and differing particle sizes or shapes and orientations. Since the fracture behaviour of rocks is important to geotechnical engineers concerned with the design of excavations and underground spaces, it is obvious that laboratory investigations of their anisotropic parameters are necessary for safe designs. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of different orientations of the anisotropy of Brisbane sandstone specimens subjected to diametral compressive (indirect tensile) loading that influences their fracture toughness. To obtain the fracture toughness values of anisotropic Brisbane sandstone, Cracked Chevron Notch Brazilian Disc (CCNBD) specimens were prepared and tested according to International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) standards. The fracture toughness of Brisbane sandstone was found to increase with increasing angle of anisotropy. Based on the experimental results, a statistical regression analysis was conducted to obtain the optimum orientation angle to obtain the highest strength under indirect tensile loading. Statistical analysis showed anisotropy orientations of 45° gave the highest fracture toughness value.
1. INTRODUCTION 
Rocks exhibit different types of anisotropy and discontinuities that affect their fracturing and strength behaviour. The anisotropy of sandstone has been recognised for about 70 years [1], and fracture propagation in sandstone and other anisotropic rocks is preferentially oriented [2]. Anisotropy also plays a dominant role in determining the velocity of elastic waves in sedimentary rocks. The most critical measure of elastic wave velocity in rocks that exhibit anisotropy is the horizontal velocity [3]. The elastic wave velocity is reduced by the opening of micro-fractures, ultimately resulting in failure [4, 5].|The uniaxial compressive strengths of anisotropic rocks parallel and normal to the orientation of the anisotropy are different, and the most reliable estimates of their resistance to fracturing and their strength is obtained when rock cores are drilled normal or near-normal to the weakest plane [6]. To determine design parameters for anisotropic rocks from laboratory test results, both maximum and minimum strengths must be measured. In addition, it has been observed that the strength of rock joints, another example of rock anisotropy, are a function of the orientation of the applied loading [7]. Generally, the effect of anisotropy decreases with increasing applied vertical stress on the rock joints. The roughness of the joint is another significant parameter that effects their strength.|","Document Type

Current Limit States (or Load and Resistance Factor) Design require determination of characteristic values of geotechnical parameters as a fundamental step in the design process. Unfortunately, there seems to be no consensus in the rock engineering community on the interpretation of the definition of characteristic values, with the result that there is often confusion about the method to be used to identify them. This is particularly true for the characteristic triaxial strength of intact rock. In this paper we will explore alternative possible approaches to determining the characteristic triaxial strength of intact rock. For the purpose of this analysis, two published data sets of triaxial strength are used. In our analysis we fit the Hoek-Brown criterion to these data, and compare alternative methods of estimating a criterion that represents characteristic strength. The methods we use are i) reducing the fitted (mean) criterion by some multiple of the standard error of the fit; and ii) using quantile regression. The results of these analyses are compared in the context of Limit State Design, and the appropriateness of their application discussed. 
1. INTRODUCTION|With the introduction of limit states design (LSD), also known as load and resistance factor design (LRFD), into geotechnical engineering, designers are required to adopt new definitions of some customary design concepts. The characteristic values of resistance (strength) and actions (loads) are examples of such new definitions.
Current geotechnical LSD codes (e.g. [1, 2]) require determination of characteristic values of geotechnical parameters as a fundamental step in the design process. Although these design codes and their associated support manuals usually give general guidance on selecting characteristic values, there seems to be no consensus in the rock engineering community on the interpretation of these guidelines. An unfortunate result is that there is often confusion about the method to be used to identify characteristic values. This is particularly true for the characteristic triaxial strength of intact rock, where additional complications arise due to the phenomenon of strength being as a function of confining pressure. This seems to be a problem specific to geotechnical LSD, since the required strength property of materials involved in structural codes (e.g. timber, steel or concrete) is the uniaxial strength which can be characterized with a single probabilistic distribution. In this paper we first briefly review the theoretical basis of LSD characteristic values, and then review in more detail the definition of characteristic values given in EN-1997 [1]. We use two previously published triaxial strength data sets [3, 4] to explore and compare alternative approaches — namely non-linear (Bayesian) regression and quantile regression — for obtaining characteristic triaxial strength curves. We conclude with observations regarding the development of characteristic curves for use in LSD, and conservative criteria for use in customary design methods |","Document Type

The uncemented annulus of an oil and gas well is a possible pathway for migration of thermogenic methane into the shallow subsurface. Poorly cemented wells allow for methane to migrate upwards from the producing formation and accumulate in the annulus between the production casing and the surrounding rock matrix. Additionally, methane from intermediate formations above the target formation may also leak methane into the annulus if they are not sealed off by cement. In the United States., the annulus of the well is capped at the surface by the bradenhead valve to prevent the venting of methane to the atmosphere. However, this valve allows gas to build and increase the pressure above the fluid in the annulus. In this work, we investigate how the buildup of bradenhead pressure influences methane migration in the subsurface. We present a two-dimensional model that simulates single phase flow of dissolved methane away from the wellbore. We consider best and worst case scenarios and we vary the boundary conditions to represent both closed and open wellbores. Our results show that the buildup of pressure in the annulus of a wellbore has a very small impact on methane migration. Of the parameters we consider, the density of the fluid in the wellbore has the greatest influence on methane migration.
1. INTRODUCTION
Over the last ten years, the extraction of resources from unconventional formations has fueled a significant rise in United States oil and natural gas production [1, 2]. Public concern with the potential environmental impacts of the extraction process has increased as well. In particular, debates have arisen about the fate of the chemicals used in the high volume slick water hydraulic fracturing process [3]. As a result, a number of studies have begun to investigate the quality of groundwater in regions with heavy unconventional oil and gas development [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
These studies have found varying degrees of methane in the shallow subsurface in the vicinity of oil and gas wells [4, 5, 9]. Although methane itself is not hazardous to human health, unless present in explosive quantities, its isotopic signature provides insight into the origin of the gas. Methane formed through intense heat and pressure (thermogenic) and methane formed by microbes (biogenic) can be distinguished from one another through analysis of the carbon and hydrogen isotopes of the methane molecules [10]. These properties make methane an attractive tracer that could indicate contamination from oil and gas drilling operations. If thermogenic methane is found in a drinking water aquifer, its presence suggests that a flaw in the oil and gas well may exist or a permeable pathway may be present between the producing formation and the shallow subsurface [4, 11]. |","Document Type

Rock burst is the dynamic failure of rock that poses serious threat to the underground activities. This is particularly the case in deep underground mining in which high in situ stresses and brittle rocks are involved. In this paper, strain burst which a type of rock burst in which gradual accumulation of strain in a rock structure such as a pillar is the cause of dynamic failure is discussed. A steel frame structure was designed as a tool to apply the compressive load to the rock specimen in the lab. The accumulated energy in the beam is high enough to cause sudden rock failure. Rock fragment velocities up to 4 m/s were measured using a high speed camera. A bonded particle-finite element model was used to simulate the rock burst testing in the lab. An approximate formulation is proposed to evaluate the induced kinetic energy due to strain bursting of a pillar. The numerical simulation results appear to support the appropriateness of the proposed formulation. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock burst is a spontaneous and uncontrolled failure of a brittle rock structure. As a result of rock burst in a pillar, in a very short period of time, the apparently statically deforming rock can turn into the dynamic deformation and violent failure. Consequently, rock particles can be ejected with a velocity of 8 to 50 m/s [1] which can cause fatal injuries and damages to the equipment. Stacey et al. [2] report that during a rock burst, the thickness of the ejected rock can be in the order of 1 meter and hence supports for the rock must be capable of absorbing the rock kinetic energy. One of the first attempts to model rock burst in a room and pillar mining system was proposed by Salamon [3] who used the stiffness matrix (K) of the mining layout together with the slope matrix (A) of the complete load convergence relations of pillars to predict the stability of the rock structure. He showed that the stable situation is achieved if the system matrix K+A is positive definite. Petukhov and Linkov [4] considered the interaction between a linear elastic rock mass with a softening material and used some energy equations to introduce a criterion for the stability of the system. Zubelewicz and Mroz [5] considered rock burst phenomenon as a dynamic instability problem. In their approach, a dynamic perturbation was superimposed into the static solution of the problem and then the possibility of kinetic energy growth of the system as an indication of rock burst was investigated. Lippmann [6] developed an elasto-plastic formulation to simulate the translatory rock bursting in the vicinity of tunnel faces. Whyatt [7] reported on the dynamic failure in deep coal mines. In particular, he showed the growing rate of dynamic failures in mines in Colorado and Utah that have caused injuries or disruption of the mining activities.|","Document Type

R., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory| Korneev, V. A., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","|Abstract
We present theoretical models and laboratory experiments for guided wave propagation within fluid-filled, open and partially open, and proppant-filled fractures. The laboratory experiments are conducted using an analogue fracture (a “trilayer” model) consisting of a pair of slender glass plates with a water and proppant-filled gap between them. Velocity and attenuation of the waves are predicted by dispersion (frequency) equations, which are derived by plane-wave analysis that employs seismic-linear-slip interface (displacement-discontinuity-boundary) conditions for modeling the low-frequency behavior of a fluid-filled fracture. The theory and the experiment are in good agreement, showing highly dispersive (i.e., the velocity changes with frequency) and attenuating wave behavior. Additionally, we present co-seismically induced electrical fields via the electokinetic effect within a proppant layer, and discuss their possible application for fracture characterization.. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Open and partially open fractures can trap and guide seismic (pressure) waves within fluid contained in the aperture. Krauklis [1] first predicted the behavior of these waves—we will call them “Krauklis waves” in this paper—which are (1) highly dispersive (the velocity depends on the frequency), (2) strongly attenuating, and (3) their propagation velocity can be far below the acoustic velocity of the fluid at low frequencies (tens of m/s to a few hundred m/s, over frequencies of a few hertz up to several kilohertz). These are essentially the characteristics of Biot’s slow compressional waves in porous, fluid-saturated rock. However, for highly permeable fractures, Krauklis waves should propagate for a substantial distance away from the source, which may allow us to use them for subsurface fracture detection and characterization (e.g., [2]). 
Although the theoretical models for Krauklis wave propagation in an open, fluid-filled fracture have been developed by many (e.g., [3][4][5]), experimental confirmations in the laboratory and in the field are still scarce. Recently, Hassan and Nagy [6], conducting laboratory ultrasonic wave propagation tests on a fluid-filled fracture, demonstrated strong velocity dispersion of the waves guided by the fracture. Nakagawa et al. [7] also conducted similar experiments at low frequencies below 1 kHz, on fractures with varied mechanical compliance and permeability. (Part of the results from this experiment will be reviewed in this paper.)|","Document Type

During the development and construction stage of the crusher chamber of Dacita Project at El Teniente mine, instabilities such as rock fall due to the looseness of rock mass confinement took place mainly in zones with singular geometries. With the purpose of evaluating the deviations that the design implementation could have, geomechanics monitoring plan considered several topographical tri-dimensional measurements with a laser scanner, using LiDAR technology, obtaining as-built geometries with a millimetric precision, which were later processed in order to analyze statistical differences in time, in other words, to monitor deformation fields in large scale. This information also represented an opportunity to develop local calibrations for the tri-dimensional numerical models built on the feasibility stage. Stress tensors were calculated on each point of the cloud obtained by LiDAR; then, results were filtered, considering all the points with lower scatter, orientations of the principal stresses and magnitudes of the mean stress, discarding points outside the preferential clusters. Two different populations of data were recognized, depending on the depth of the overbreak compared to the geometry of the design. Finally, results obtained from the back-analysis allowed corroborating the initial design considerations and the consolidation of the background information necessary for future requirements. 
1. INTRODUCTION|1.1. El Teniente Mine overview El Teniente Mine is a Codelco Chile underground copper mine. It is located in the Andes range in the central zone of Chile, about 70 km SSE from the capital city, Santiago. El Teniente is the largest known copper– molybdenum deposit in the world. It is hosted in a copper porphyry system. The main rock types include Andesites, Diorites and Hydrothermal Breccias of the Miocene era. Since 1906, more than 1100 million tons of ore have been mined. The mine is currently extracting around 140,000 tons/day using mechanized caving methods. Advanced and post-undercut panel caving methods, variations of the standard block caving, were introduced in 1982 and 1994, respectively to exploit primary copper ore. |","Document Type

H., Curtin University| James Cornwell, A., Curtin University| Rasouli, V., University of North Dakota| Hossain, M., Curtin University","|Abstract
In this study, hydraulic fracturing tests were conducted on 150 mm synthetic cubic samples. The borehole drilled in the center of the sample was cased and perforations were created in the samples. A true tri-axial stress cell was used to simulate real far field stress conditions. In addition, dimensional analyses were performed to correspond the results of lab experiments to field-scale operations. Three different fracturing fluids with viscosities ranging from 20 to 600 Pa.s were used to investigate the effects of varying fracturing fluid viscosities and fluid injection rates on fracturing mechanism. The results indicated that by increasing the fracturing fluid viscosity and fluid injection rates, the fracturing energy rises, and consequently the fracturing pressures will increase. However, as the fracturing energy is transferred to the sample at a faster rate, the fracturing power increases, and accordingly the fracture initiation angle rises; this would lead to more curved fracture planes. It was evident that fractures would reorient perpendicular to the minimum principal stress direction despite the angle of initiation. Furthermore, it was observed that the presence of casing in the wellbore would influence the stress distribution around the casing in such a way that the fracture propagation tends to deviate from the wellbore vicinity. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is commonly used as the most viable stimulation technique in order to improve the production rate and recovery factor of the oil and gas reservoirs. When performing a hydraulic fracturing operation in a cased perforated wellbore many problems may arise. These problems lead to high frictional pressure losses near the wellbore, and consequently would result in significant increase in the operation pressures and eventually premature screen-out [1-3]. Additionally, other issues such as multiple fracturing and near wellbore fracture tortuosity have been encountered during the implication of the hydraulic fracturing operation in cased perforated completions [4]. The quality of a hydraulic fracturing operation could be negatively impacted by these issues, and consequently the fracturing treatment may not improve the production of the wellbore effectively. Such kind of challenges are mainly due to the existence of the perforations cavities which complicate the fracture initiation and near wellbore propagation [5, 6].|","Document Type

Cemented and uncemented aggregate materials form the main component of road pavements, and play a key role in pavement behaviour under vehicle-induced cyclic loads. In this paper, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) was used to simulate the response of these aggregate materials under various loading conditions. Initially, aggregates of five different shapes and four different sizes, assembled at a certain volume ratio, were subjected to compression tests under constant confining pressure. The results indicated that: (i) cracks initiate more easily in larger particles and in the angular rocks at sharper corners; (ii) shear cracks occur more frequently than tensile cracks; and (iii) more micro fractures are obtained with increasing the confining pressure. Additionally, four different cyclic loadings were applied to a simulated flexible pavement with a Cement Treated Base (CTB) layer to understand the impact of loading type on pavement behaviour. The results showed that: (i) settlement of the CTB layer increases significantly with increasing the stress amplitude and decreased with increasing vertical loading frequency for sinusoidal vertical loading; and (ii) more settlement occurs in the CTB layer under cyclic moving wheels carrying constant vertical loads than that caused by cyclic moving wheels carrying sinusoidal vertical loads both at the same mean stress. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The breakage of particles relies on multiple factors; namely, particle size distribution (PSD) [1], particle shape [2, 3], confining pressure [4, 5], and loading conditions [6]. Laboratory observations show that the fracturing of different types of particles depends heavily on their contact with neighbouring particles [7]. This has been visualised by numerical simulations of circular particle assemblies under compression [8] and inter-particle breakage of irregular aggregate assemblies having limited and arbitrary particle sizes [9, 10]. However, to better understand particle breakage caused by particle interactions, further study on various irregular particles having specified sizes and volume ratios should be performed. |","Document Type

Economical production of shale resources requires drilling horizontal wellbores with either sequential or zipper-frac completion in order to increase the fracture complexity in tight reservoirs. Properly estimating the final fracture geometry is the primary challenge in these compound fracturing practices. Various parameters control the fracture geometry including: fracture spacing, in-situ differential stress, pump rate and fluid viscosity. Two important fracture characteristic that should be addressed in such a complex system in order to have a proper estimation about fracture geometry, are fracture height and out of plane propagation. Although the modeling of hydraulically driven fractures in such a medium has been advanced over the past decades, there have been a few attempts to investigate these two phenomena together in an implicit model.
This article advances a hydraulic fracture model that predicts single and multi-fracture propagation. The model simultaneously simulates the dynamic growth of multiple fractures while addressing the stress interference between the fractures and its effect on fracture propagation. The hydraulic fracture model is based on displacement discontinuity method for simulating fracture propagation in multi-fracture systems. Using the simulator, variations in the parameters affecting the behavior of hydraulic fractures were explored. The simulator is able to predict non-planar fracture propagation due to stress interference between adjacent fractures. For studying fracturing fluid, fluid flow equations are solved using finite difference and are fully coupled with geomechanical solver. The effect on fracture propagation from variations in fluid viscosity, injection rate, stress interference, fracture spacing, stress anisotropy and perforation direction are presented for a multi fracture system.
The result of this study indicates that stress shadowing is the main factor affecting hydraulic fracture propagation. It changes the direction and magnitude of the principal stresses around fractures and may cause early screen out or tortuosity in fractures created from single or multiple wells. Therefore, an optimized fracture spacing is needed for placing more fracture into the system. The results of this study would help operators to better optimize the fracture spacing in horizontal wellbores and maximize the complexity needed for a typical horizontal fracturing job. |","Document Type

The segment lining structure physical modeling experiment of shield tunnel cross the ground fissure with 30° is designed according to the similarity theory, which based on the Xi’an metro engineering and the geological environment of Xi’an ground fissure. The strain of segment concrete, longitudial bolt, and circumferential bolt, the contact soil pressure and peripheral soil pressure, convergence displacement of segment lining, the soil settlement on the top of model and other macrophenomena show that the main deformation and damage modes of segment lining structure of shield tunnel cross the ground fissure with 30° is shearing with distortion on local; the deformation and damage range is from 1.25D (D is the external diameter of segment ring) in the hanging side to 0.75D in the lying side; the deformation and damage of segment ring is asymmetric and partial compressive; the dislocation of circumferential seam on the soffit which is up to 40mm(0.033D) is bigger than that of crown and arch waist. It is difficult for the model to apply the 20cm(0.1667D) deformation of ground fissure, and the segment lining structure of shield tunnel is unsuitable to the geological environment with violent activity of ground fissure. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Shield tunnel structure is widely used in the urban area, because of its small influence to the surrounding environment, little pollution and fast speed. Lining segment structure of shield tunnel belongs to flexible structure. Its deformation in response to the force, because of the subside of stiffness of bolt joint, is clearly different from the integral tunnel lining structure. Furthermore, due to the special geological environment, there are more than 10 existing ground fissures in Xi’an area and their activity is in progress at present[1]. Lining segment structure of tunnel is potentially in great danger. The angle of intersection and the distance between the ground fractures greatly affect the severity of the damage. At the same time, the stiffness and strength of the structure also play an important role on the extent and other regularity of damage.|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
The primary concern when constructing underground spaces for dumping and storing high-level radioactive waste deeper than 300 m in the earth, and when constructing tunnels for the Linear Chuo Shinkansen 1000 m below earth cover, is space destabilization due to high ground pressure or sudden water leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to assure construction safety and maintain the stability of the underground space for as long a time as possible. Furthermore, these structures should be sound and have a quality higher than is required in the construction of ordinary underground structures. Simultaneously, the reduction of construction costs is very important; this means that more efficient and effective designs and construction methods are required. 
For this, the authors developed a grouting quality control system (Japanese patent publication number 2013-221298) to provide the best water stopping measures, which differ according to the geological features present, and applied it to the construction of a dam1) and examined the applicability to underground space construction.2) To provide the best water stopping measures possible according to the geological features, this system combines the use of (1) a crack density diagram to calculate the direction of the drilled injection holes that will best intersect with extant cracks and (2) a method to draw a contour plot of rock water channels based on the results of geostatistical analyses.|","Document Type

Laboratory experiments on samples from a consolidated sandstone reservoir are presented that demonstrate rate type compaction behaviour similar to that observed on unconsolidated sands and soils. Such rate type behaviour can have large consequences for reservoir compaction, surface subsidence and induced seismicity resulting from oil and gas production. During traditional single loading rate laboratory experiments, the effect of loading rate on uniaxial compressibility can be ignored to first approximation. In contrast, strongly non-linear compaction occurs when stepwise increases or decreases in loading rate are applied within a loading cycle, during loading after creep or during loading after partial unloading. A modified version of the RTCM rate type compaction model, built on Dieterich’s rate and state friction equation describes the experimental results well. The new isotach version solves a number of limitations of the original model at the cost of an additional parameter that specifies the split between direct (elastic) and secular (creep) strain. The good fits between the updated model and the experimental data suggest that rate and state friction - e.g. on sliding contact surfaces between assemblies of cemented grains or on sliding micro-cracks - causes the observed non-linear compaction. The same rate and state friction phenomena have been linked to the non-linear rate-dependent earthquake generation in volcanism-induced seismicity, suggesting similar rate dependence for the induced seismicity in depleting oil and gas fields. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Production of gas from the large Groningen field in the Netherlands causes surface subsidence as predicted prior to the start of production [1]. Above the centre of the field the subsidence is now some 35 cm, important for a country like the Netherlands which would largely flood without the presence of dykes and active pumping. As for a number of other oil and gas fields [2, 3] subsidence in Groningen was initially much lower than expected based on measurements carried out on samples taken from the reservoir. As for other fields the subsidence later accelerated, coming closer to values expected and leading to the notion of “delayed subsidence” [2]. During the stage of accelerated subsidence, shallow earthquakes started to occur in Groningen that have been increasing in numbers and strength over time (Fig. 1.). An example is the strongest tremor so far with a magnitude of 3.6 that occurred near the village of Huizinge in 2012, causing damage to thousands of homes and raising anxiety among those living on or near the field [4]. The mechanism behind the earthquakes is understood to be (differential) compaction at reservoir level reactivating larger faults with substantial offset [5]. Better understanding of the physics of these processes is important to predict the further evolution of the Groningen subsidence and to find out if it is possible to influence the level of seismicity by production changes. Rate and state friction has been proposed as an explanation for the observed non-linear compaction behaviour of the Groningen field [6, 7]. The same rate and state friction phenomena have been linked to rate-dependent earthquake generation [8, 9]. Hence a number of laboratory experiments, previously carried out to study the effects of changes in loading rate on the compaction behaviour of Groningen reservoir rock, have been re-analysed using a modified (isotach) formulation of the rate type compaction model [10] with the hope to derive new insights into the physics of reservoir compaction and induced earthquake generation.|","Document Type

This paper presents a model of the stress and pore-pressure dependence of permeability in organic-rich shale rocks such as gas shales, which are porous media that consist of (at least) two constituents – kerogen (organic) and inorganic matter – with significantly different mechanical properties. The model treats these organic-rich rocks as porous media in which both organic and inorganic constituents have laminar morphology. This leads to a more complicated dependence of permeability rather than that of differential (Terzaghi) effective stress, i.e. confining stress minus pore pressure as in the case of one-solid constituent porous medium. The model provides a better description of effective stress, and better explains the dynamic impact of geomechanical stresses on key production parameters such as porosity and permeability. Comparison of this model with classical theories and limited experimental results is performed. This new model is a generalization of the earlier developed spherical composite model [1] for more realistic laminated texture of gas shale rock. Additional dependence of permeability on pore pressure is captured by taking into account Knudsen flow contributions. The model provides basis for estimation of maximum drawdown which still avoids collapse of porosity and permeability of softer organic constituent. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Gas shale rock has at least two distinct solid constituents, which are organic and inorganic matter. The most important mechanical difference is that the organic matter is significantly softer (approximately four times, see [1, 2]) than the inorganic matter. It may cause a noticeable difference in stress values in organic matter and inorganic matter. In turn this feature leads to different evolution of porosity and permeability in the different solid constituents. |","Document Type

J., Texas Tech University| Cook, T., Apache Corporation| Barnes, W., Apache Corporation| Mody, F., Apache Corporation| Watson, M., Texas Tech University| Porter, M., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Viswanathan, H., Los Alamos National Laboratory","|Abstract
The current technique to produce shale oil is through primary depletion using horizontal wells with multiple transverse fractures. The oil recovery in oil-bearing shale reservoirs may be less than 10%, which leaves a large percentage of the oil unrecoverable without enhanced oil recovery methods. However, there is no EOR method tested or implemented in shale oil reservoirs. Before testing an EOR method, feasible methods need to be screened. 
In this paper a screen study was first conducted to analyze the feasibility of every EOR method for a Wolfcamp shale oil reservoir. Actual reservoir and fluid data, and field operational parameters were used. The study shows that water injection and gas injection are most feasible EOR methods. After that, a detailed simulation study was carried out to evaluate the potentials of water and gas injection. The model was calibrated with the actual reservoir performance data. Waterflooding, cyclic water injection, gas flooding and cyclic gas injection were evaluated. The results show that cyclic gas injection provides the highest EOR potential for this reservoir. Simulation results indicate that the oil recovery factor can be increased more than one time by gas injection. This study provides a justification for a possible field implementation in the shale reservoir. It also provides a guide for the EOR screening in shale oil reservoirs.
1. INTRODUCTION
Unconventional shale reservoirs are generally produced by stimulation techniques. A horizontal well with multiple transverse fractures has proven to be an effective technique for shale gas and shale oil production. However, shale oil production faces more challenges compared with shale gas production. Even applying multi-stage hydraulic fracturing techniques, the final oil recovery factors using existing methods are only a few percent. Oil rate and reservoir pressure drop very quickly. Because most of oil remains unrecoverable even using the expensive horizontal well drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing, seeking the ways to enhance oil recovery will be the continuous efforts. |","Document Type

Experimental methods and results are presented for two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic fracturing experiments investigating the interaction and crossing of a hydraulic fracture with a pre-existing frictional discontinuity. The 2D experimental results include direct viewing and measurement of fracture path along with fracture and interface displacement. These data are compared directly to results from a 2D numerical hydraulic fracture model. The 2D experimental method involves propagating a hydraulic fracture from the centre of a 350 by 350 by 50 mm rock sample. Transparent shims are used to transmit the normal stress to the face of the sample and allow continuous digital video records to be made of the fracture growth and fracture interaction with the orthogonal discontinuity. Displacement of a grid drawn onto the sample face is measured by optical analysis methods, allowing the fracture and interface opening to be measured to better than 10-micron resolution. The data provide information about fracture crossing/arresting, path, and fracture and interface displacement with time. The numerical model matched the experiment in the sense of correctly predicting crossing in one case and blunting in the other. The model was unable to match the pressure from the experiments in siltstone, primarily because of not including effects from the pump and injection system compliance.
1. INTRODUCTION
The mechanics involved in a hydraulic fracture interacting with a natural fracture have been extensively studied over the past years because this process produces a number of first order effects on fracture growth. The crossing interaction can result in branching, offsetting, and even blunting of the hydraulic fracture tip, significantly changing the fracture growth, excess pressure, and width. A verified method to predict the outcome of a crossing interaction is therefore necessary in any fracture stimulation model intended for design and post-treatment analysis of hydraulic fractures placed in naturally fractured rock. This paper is primarily concerned with describing and illustrating the use of a new experimental method that allows two dimensional hydraulic fractures to be grown and studied as they interact with a frictional interface. Therefore, only a brief review of previous work on the topic of hydraulic fractures interacting with frictional discontinuities is provided.|","Document Type

T., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory| Battistelli, A., Saipem SpA","|Abstract
We present preliminary simulation results of coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical-chemical processes in saliferous formations in the context of underground disposal of heat-generating nuclear waste in rock salt with crushed salt backfill. The work presented in this paper is the continuation of recent work in which the effects of halite dissolution/precipitation were not considered. The simulations have been performed using TOUGH-FLAC, with an equation-of-state module that effectively considers fluids of variable salinity. The preliminary results presented suggest that the backfill reconsolidation process is not affected noticeably when halite dissolution/precipitation is accounted for (in particular, time for reconsolidation and final porosities reached). Concerning the natural salt, the most important effect is related to the increasing solubility of halite with temperature, which affects the effective porosity. Assuming that porosity changes due to chemical effects influence permeability, our simulation results suggest that the extension of the area affected by a secondary permeability is greater when dissolution/precipitation is considered. These results are preliminary and should be validated based on experimental evidence. The time frame during which chemical effects have a noticeable impact is dependent upon the heat power released by the waste packages, and extends between 10 and 100-200 years in the scenario investigated. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock salt is a potential medium for the underground disposal of nuclear waste because of several favorable properties: undisturbed rock salt is water and gas tight, it has very low porosity and high thermal conductivity as compared to other shallow-crustal rock types. In addition, rock salt shows creep behavior and is able to heal technically induced fractures if the stress regime is propitious [1-4]. Moreover, rock salt is usually found underground in large volumes in geologically stable areas and is easy to mine [5]. The run-of-mine salt can be used to backfill the open mined spaces (crushed salt backfill, with average grain size smaller than 50- 60 mm [6]).|","Document Type

Construction of mountain roads at western Saudi Arabia is a challenge, where the rock masses are high-rising, steep slopes. Al-Hada mountain road of almost 22 km long shows many incidents of rockfalls. A studied 100 m long portion of mountain road lie along a man-made and natural sharp slope cut suffers from slope failures, rockfalls incidents, mainly in rainy seasons. The igneous rock masses are medium quality. The 40 m-height rock slope-cut along the road has no benches. The steep man-made rock slope cut is very close to the road, forming a potentially source for rockfalls. The Swedge, Roctopple, and RocFall computer program utilized to perform modeling and mitigation of the rock slope. No remedial measures taken to prevent the debris flows to take place. Input parameters such as block size, seeder point’s locations of blocks falls, slope angle, restitution coefficients, and slope roughness used to model the rock mass characteristics such as strength, bounce height, kinetic energies, and translational and rotational velocities. Modeling of the input parameters indicates the increase of the hit energy and end-point of rockfalls as the block size and slope angle increases. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The slope failures, landslides and rockfalls frequently occur along mountain roads in rugged terrains. One of the most difficult terrains in western Saudi Arabia is the Al-Hada descent (Fig. 1). The famous Al-Hada descent lies at the upstream high elevation region of Wadi Na’man in the western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which known as Arabian Shield. The elevations at the top of the Al-Hada road reach almost 2,000 m a.m.s.l. and its alignment lies within the sharp cliff edges of the Sarawat Mountains at the highest elevations. Before ascend the road starts from about 500 m elevation and reaches to more than 2,000 m, in a number of road twists.|","Document Type

The fracturing of any component of the CO2 storage system is generally viewed as a liability to be avoided. Yet in large-scale CCS, injection-induced fracturing of the storage reservoir is almost a certainty, even when operators keep injection pressures below the nominal fracture gradient. Models and field data indicate that pipeline-delivered CO2 will still be relatively cool when it enters the reservoir. The consequent thermoelastic stress reduces the fluid pressure needed to fracture the reservoir, so much so that commercial injection rates will not be possible if fracturing is prohibited. Simple models show that the CO2 does not warm significantly within the fracture, but the injection-induced fracture nevertheless propagates only a finite distance into the storage reservoir because friction within the fracture reduces the fluid pressure at the fracture tip. This prediction is consistent with field observations of injectivity. Such self-limiting propagation is useful for increasing the rate of storage and need not jeopardize the containment of the CO2, especially if injection is coupled with pressure management via extraction wells. We present field data from water flooded oil reservoirs that support this assertion. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Geological CO2 sequestration (GCS) in deep saline aquifer is one of the most promising techniques for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but its potential strongly depends on large injection rates, long term storage security and low-cost operations [1]. An important regulation of GCS could be the constraint on the injection pressure to be below the formation breakdown pressure [2]. Yet even if the pressure constraint is met, injection-induced fractures can still occur in the storage reservoir. One reason is the reduction of tangential stress caused by injecting cool fluid into a warm reservoir [3-5]. When the temperature of injection fluid is significantly lower than the formation temperature at the bottomhole of injection well, the superposition of thermoelastic stress greatly reduces the tangential stress around the wellbore, allowing initiation of a tensile fracture at fluid pressures below nominal fracture pressure [6]. |","Document Type

In the petroleum industry, the stress evolution is considered a key factor to understand the geomechanical behaviour of hydrocarbon production fields. Inside the reservoir, changes of stresses have been linked with uniform changes of pore pressure through simple relationships, called reservoir stress paths. However, the stress evolution can also be affected by the mechanical properties and the reservoir geometry. Analytical solutions have been proposed for ellipsoidal reservoir shapes. Enhanced methods based on the theory of nucleus of strain have been developed for arbitrary three-dimensional reservoir shapes, but they cannot provide results inside the reservoir. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a methodology to assess the evolution of displacements, strains and stresses both outside and inside the reservoir. As an application of this methodology, a synthetic model considering a thick cylindrical reservoir submitted to uniform and non-uniform depletion is shown. The results are discussed through the identification of different geomechanical behaviour inside and outside of the reservoir. Nevertheless, this methodology can be applied to arbitrary reservoir shapes, providing an alternative tool which properly extends the concept of reservoir stress paths to reservoir stress changes. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In overall, changes in reservoir pore pressure due to fluid production or injection induce stress changes within the reservoir and its surrounding rocks. These stress changes lead to reservoir swelling or compaction, which in turn can trigger potential geomechanical problems such as surface subsidence, fault reactivation, pore collapse, casing deformation and seismicity. 
Inside the reservoir, changes in the horizontal and vertical stresses have been linked with uniform changes in pore pressure through simple relationships, called reservoir stress paths. In general, it is assumed that the reservoir supports the overburden pressure completely. Consequently, the vertical stress path is disregarded and the horizontal stress path occurs under uniaxial deformation. According to Goulty [1], in the reservoir rock three mechanisms can provide different approaches to the horizontal stress path: normal compaction, poroelastic behaviour and normal faulting. |","Document Type

The shale gas boom has been a game changer for the energy industry. Many drilling problems related to wellbore instability are caused by incompatibilities between the drilling fluid and the shale formations encountered. This problem is not new, and the drilling industry has developed many effective testing methods for evaluating the compatibility. However, these useful methods are not effective for unconventional resources, as unconventional shale is very different from traditional swelling shale. This paper presents recently developed testing methods for on unconventional shale. The new testing methods presented in this paper include: a) Indentation test to evaluate shale mechanical property degradation as a function of drilling fluids’ chemistry and rheology over time; b) Scratch test with repeated passes to evaluate the depth of shale mechanical property degradation; c) Fluid penetration test to evaluate drilling fluids’ penetration rate into the shale and sealing of micro-fractures in fissile shale; d) Wellbore stimulator to evaluate drilling fluids’ chemistry, rheology, and filtration effects on wellbore stability under downhole pressure and temperature. Test results on the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of these testing methods for evaluating drilling fluids’ effects on unconventional shale and wellbore stability. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The shale gas and oil boom has been a game changer for the oil and gas industry, with an investment of billions of dollars and creation of over two million new jobs [1]. Many thousands of shale gas and oil wells have been drilled every year. In the Eagle Ford shale play alone, over 4,000 new wells were drilled every year since 2012 [2]. Much experience has been gained and much progress has been made from drilling such a large number of wells [3], resulting in improved drilling efficiency from year to year. Wellbore or shale instability is still the largest cause of non-productive time in shale oil and gas drilling operations [3]. The design, evaluation, and selection of the most suitable drilling fluid is central to managing shale instability and to achieving drilling cost reduction.
Managing shale instability is not new to the drilling industry, yet oil/gas shale is quite different from traditional shale. The industry has been dealing with shale instability since the beginning of oil well drilling and has developed many effective and fit-for-purpose testing methods for testing and evaluating shale and fluid interaction [4]. These methods are often effective and useful in selecting the most suitable drilling fluid for highly or moderately reactive shale. When these traditional methods are applied to oil and gas shale, little or no differences with various fluids are seen from the traditional tests, resulting in the conclusion, according to conventional understanding and knowledge, that gas or oil shale is non-reactive shale and drilling fluids do not make a difference. Drilling experience in unconventional resources showed a clear difference of drilling fluids on wellbore stability and non-productive time [3, 5, 6]. |","Document Type

In the Clay formation of the Mont Terri, we have performed acoustic experiments to monitor the excavation damaged zone induced in the surrounding of a new gallery Ga08. The experiments took place in the end-face of a previous gallery Ga04 with an excavation operation coming from the opposite direction to joint both galleries. The study dealt with the rock mass segment, 8 m in length, left for two weeks between the Ga04 end-face and the Ga08 excavation front. Acoustic surveys, performed with a controlled acoustic source introduced inside the rock mass segment, allowed defining the transversely isotropic P-wave velocity field of the medium. Passive acoustic measurements, which consisted in detecting induced acoustic events, allowed identifying actual microseismic events induced by stress redistribution in the surrounding of the Ga08 excavation front. We assessed the damage mechanism of these events and clearly highlighted strong correlations between spatial, temporal and mechanism attributes, in agreement with both the geological facies and the gallery orientation with respect to geological preexisting features. Finally, we present preliminary results on additional acoustic events located inside the rock mass segment.
1. INTRODUCTION
A large scale geological rock mass is subjected to different natural stresses, including tensional, compressive and shear stresses. The rock response to such ambient stress is controlled by the lithology, the pressure condition the rock is under, i.e. the normal to horizontal stress ratio, and the time the rock is under stress. Depending on these in situ conditions, which control the stress field, different damage structures may appear in the geological structure, including faults, fractures, cracks and/or crystal dislocations [1,2]. 
At short time and space scales, the stress field can be modified for instance when a gallery is excavated in such a stressed environment : it induces a stress redistribution in the vicinity of the excavation, in particular the so-called excavation damaged zone (EDZ) [3,4]. Characterization of the EDZ, where plastic deformation occurs leading to significant hydromechanical changes [5], is of primary importance in many research topics related to underground galleries, in particular when dealing with deep geological repositories. Indeed, damage structures constitute preferential pathways for radionuclides to reach the free surface or ground water reservoirs. In this context, clay formation are interesting for both its low permeability and its self-sealing capacity [4,6]. As a consequence, monitoring the EDZ in such geological formation is a major but not straightforward research field which motivate numerous in situ experiments in the underground research laboratory (URL) of Mont Terri (Switzerland), situated in the Opalinus Clay formation of the Folded Jura [7,8].|","Document Type

The generation of a subsidence crater on the surface derived from an underground mine exploitation, has been under study since the 70’s with works done by Peck (1969), Shandbolt (1978), Kvapil et al (1989) and Flores (2005), among the most famous. All these studies were developed using available observations together with the characterization of rock massifs and materials disposition, to elaborate rules that would allow the estimation of the extension of motion caused by the phenomena of subsidence. 
Since 2010, El Teniente mine of CODELCO – CHILE has been monitoring the ground subsidence generated by the underground exploitation using radar satellite data (InSAR) by applying methods based in differential interferometry (DInSAR). This has allowed obtaining accurate ground motion measurements over large extensions of land, which have been used to develop a behavior model that establishes a link cause-effect between the underground works and surface subsidence. This conceptual model represents a consistent relationship between underground mining and subsidence development on the surface. 
These analyses have been applied in the delineation of the subsidence effect and in the development of a conceptual model for the subsidence process that is generated by the phenomena from the base of the exploitation up to the surface. The results indicate a significant difference between the traditional estimation of subsidence angles and results obtained from inSAR technology. Finally, the subsidence interpretation using interfereometric satellite methodologies show a reduction of the extension effect on the surface due to underground drawing with a consequent reduction in angles of breaking and influence. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Today, the availability of technologies such as InSAR, has allowed us to build digital terrain models (DTM) with high accuracy and updating periods in the order of 10 days. These measurements have been carried biannually since 2011 (due to the snow in winter no measurements are made) Thus, to date there exist sufficient measurements with which to generate a model of behavior that allows estimation of the range of subsidence parameters as a function of mining, geotechnical and environmental efforts.|","Document Type

D., Memorial University of Newfoundland","|Abstract
This study is an evaluation of the feasibility of real-time drilling performance monitoring using a near-bit AE detection tool in drilling with PDC drag bits under laboratory conditions to investigate an improved drilling performance with a new Vibration Assisted Rotational Drilling tool. This paper focuses on calibrating the micro-seismic response to rock failure mechanisms, improved Rate of Penetration (ROP) and cutting particle-size distribution. Concrete cylinders with comparable properties to natural rock were fabricated in the laboratory. Drill-Off Tests (DOT) were conducted under rigid and compliant drilling with a two-cutter PDC bit. Simultaneously, micro-crack Acoustic Emissions (AE) from the bit-rock interaction process were monitored by four symmetrically mounted Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) sensors. The fracture characteristics were investigated by analyzing acoustic events in terms of event occurrence rate, and average event energy. Analysis from the DOT indicates that some factors are correlated with improved drilling performance, including particle-size distribution, vibration compliance setting and acoustic emission. A stronger vibration compliance setting increases ROP by increasing cutting depth per revolution and bigger cuttings are generated. Higher average event energy corresponds to bigger cracking when cracking event rate increases. All of this has contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms of improved drilling performance. 
1. INTRODUCTION
One of the major problems for field drilling engineers is how to drill to target formations fast and safely. In drilling subsurface formations a vertical oscillation generator was found to increase penetration rate [1] and this early stage of oscillation vibrator drilling was called Resonant Sonic Drilling. After that, both surface and offshore mechanical vibrator were introduced [2]. Vertical vibration applied to a bit leads to fluctuations in WOB which interact with rock. A new vibration tool developed in the Advanced Drilling Laboratory (ADL) at Memorial University was tested for improving ROP [3, 4]. Laboratory tests have shown that controlled amplitude and frequencies of vibration are available from this vibration tool and the effect of vibration on drilling efficiency and penetration rate was investigated.
Micro seismic events, or acoustic emission (AE), are the elastic waves produced when rock undergoes internal change, such as micro crack initialization and propagation. In non-destructive testing (NDT), piezoelectric transducers are commonly employed in detecting and monitoring micro crack propagation. As an alternative way to ‘see’ micro crack initiation and propagation, AE detection has been applied in triaxial compression tests to monitor the whole deformation process [5]. Some AE parameters such as dominant frequency, event energy and cumulative emission counts are related to the different deformation stages. Numerical simulation with PFC2d models has been used to simulate UCS tests to predict rock failure [6, 7]. In this PFC model, hit number is scaled by counting crack number under tri-axial compression tests. AE detection is commonly used in hydraulic fracturing (HF) researches. Fluids has been injected at high pressure into cylindrical rock to simulate hydraulic fracturing with AE detection of crack initiation and propagation [8]. |","Document Type

The Particle Flow Code (PFC) is a useful tool for simulating the failure behavior of hard rocks. The introduction of clump logic into the PFC modeling has made it possible to better reproduce the brittleness characteristic of hard rocks, namely, the large difference between compressive strength and tensile strength. However, there is a problem in the PFC simulation with the clumped particle model, namely, when we simulate Brazilian tensile tests on hard rocks, the results do not fully express the rapid decrease in tensile stress after the peak stress. One reason for this problem is the existence of clumps that block the rapid propagation and the connection of the micro-cracks in the model by their interlocking effect. Focusing on the effect of clump configuration on the Brazilian tensile failure behavior of hard rocks, this paper carried out simulations by varying clump and ball size. The experimental mechanical properties of Lac du Bonnet granite were targeted in the simulations. From the simulation results, we confirmed that brittleness can be controlled by changing the ratio of clump size to minimum ball size and that under a constant ratio of clump size to minimum ball size, the local peak stress does not change with the minimum ball size. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The Particle Flow Code (PFC), a numerical simulation code based on the distinct element method (DEM), is an effective numerical tool for simulating the failure process of hard rocks. By introducing the contact- and parallel-bond and clumped particle model (Cho et al., 2007 [1]), PFC has become better able to express the brittle failure of hard rocks (e.g., Funatsu et al., 2008 [2]). On the other hand, a problem has been pointed out, namely, that a PFC simulation with the clumped particle model cannot reproduce the rapid strain-softening behavior in Brazilian tensile tests (Inoue et al., 2009 [3]; Nakashima et al., 2011, 2013 [4, 5]). In addition, the cracks generated in the simulation are too widely distributed in the specimen compared to those in experiments. This problem should be overcome before handling actual excavation problems, firstly because the stress field generated around real underground cavities may be more complicated than that of the Brazilian tensile condition, and secondly because Brazilian tests and uniaxial compression tests are the most commonly used element tests to calibrate the input parameters of a PFC simulation. If Brazilian tests are not simulated with adequate accuracy, reliable input parameters cannot be obtained to model the targeted rock.|","Document Type

In order to simulate the behavior of composite structures consisting of discontinuous blocks on the saturated ground, a soil-water coupled code based on NMM-DDA (coupled Numerical Manifold Method and Discontinuous Deformation Analysis) for saturated ground was newly developed. The code consists of three governing equations, the equation of motion for the DDA part, the equilibrium equation and the continuity equation for the NMM part. In the formulation, the first and the second equations were combined using the contact treatment with the penalty method similarly to the original NMM-DDA. Then, the equilibrium equation and the continuity equation for the NMM region was coupled with the effective stress concept based on u-p formulation. This coupling formulation enables the stability analysis of masonry structure on the saturated ground. As a verification of newly developed simulation code, one-dimensional consolidation analysis was carried out. The simulation results showed good agreement with the analytical solution of Terzaghi’s consolidation equation, and the validity of the new code was confirmed. 
1. INTRODUCTION
There are many geotechnical engineering problems significantly affected by geometrical discontinuity, although the soil mechanics is usually discussed based on the continuum mechanics. A typical example is the stability problem of masonry or concrete block structures constructed on a soil foundation. Fig. 1 is a historic masonry building in Cambodia which foundation ground showed uneven settlement due to the self-weight of the structure [1]. The building was inclined because of the settlement, and some joint openings appeared on the wall. The mechanical behavior of this kind of structure is governed by mutual interaction between discontinuous structural members, interaction on the ground-structure interface, and the deformation of the ground. Additionally, when a structure was constructed on a ground which may shows consolidation phenomenon, generation and dissipation of excess pore water pressure will have much impact on the long-term deterioration process of the structure. Since it is difficult to solve such a complicated problem theoretically, development of numerical methods which can consider above factors is demanded for the stability evaluation. In this paper, as a method which satisfy the requirements mentioned above, a soil-water coupled analysis code based on NMM-DDA [2], one of the discontinuum based numerical methods, was newly developed. |","Document Type

In recent years, subway has developed rapidly in many cities of China. However, the environmental problems caused by train vibration load, such as the large settlement of surrounding ground around tunnels, can’t be ignored. The subway tunnels in shanghai mainly lie in the 3rd layer of muddy-silty clay or the 4th layer of muddy clay. These two layers of clay were especially soft and sensitive to vibration load. In this paper, a numerical study on long-time deformation characteristics of soft clay around the tunnel of Shanghai Metro Line 9 under train vibration load was presented. The numerical simulation adopted an elasticplastic constitutive model that can take into account the long-term accumulation of soil deformation and excess pore water pressure under a huge number of cyclic loadings. The simulated results, including long-time displacement of soils around the tunnel, ground surface subsidence, and the variation of excess pore water pressure, were analyzed and discussed. The final settlement of surrounding ground was predicted through analyzing the variation tendency of maximum vertical displacement of soil. By comparing the simulated results and the measured data, it was proved that the simulated results were consistent with the measured data. Therefore, the long-term deformation of soil around subway tunnels under vibration load can be evaluated and predicted by the numerical method presented in this paper.
1. INTRODUCTION
Metro has become an important part of urban public traffic because of the less occupation of land and space, fast speed and little pollution. Subway effectively eases the pressure on increasingly overloaded urban traffic and expands the available space in the city. According to statistics, the total length of metro lines has reached 1200km in China. In addition, a large number of city’s metro construction projects have been approved. With the rapid development of city rail traffic, a new round of metro construction boom will inevitably be set off. But the environmental problems caused by city rail traffic construction cannot be ignored. Among the problems, environmental impact of vibration induced by metro is particularly significant |","Document Type

A serials of loading-unloading experiments of marble in Jinping II hydropower station, China, are carried out to investigate its failure mechanism under complex stress condition. It is found that, the marble failure process is divided into five stages, including initial crack closure, linear elastic stage, damage development, macro-crack development and rock structure stage. During the initial crack closure stage, different confining pressures produce different initial crack volumetric strain and different compressible extents of initial crack which indicates the dominant effect of confining pressure during the initial crack closure stage. The results obtained from confining pressure reduction test show that the inflection point of volumetric strain of Jinping II marble always lags behind the unloading point and the macro failure happens at 80%-95% of peak stress. This behavior plays an important role to control the support time when tunnels are excavated and provides a theoretical basis for preventing the failure of hard rock under loading-unloading condition. 
1. INTRODUCTION
With the development of human's society, the scarcity of energy becomes increasingly serious. Jinping II hydropower station in China [1,2], was built to solve part of the energy problem. With the excavation of tunnels, some complex mechanical behaviors, such as highly nonlinearity, discontinuity and anisotropy, of the deep-seated marbles were exhibited. Therefore, it's important to study the behavior of marble in Jinping II hydropower station which will help us to understand its complex failure mechanism.
In this paper, a serials of loading-unloading experiments of Jinping Marble were conducted. The volumetric strain, crack volumetric strain, equivalent plastic strain and the relation of stress-strain are combined to analyze its failure mechanism. Especially, the crack volumetric strain can reflect the damage development in the rock. This variable first introduced by CD. Martin[3-5] and then widely used to study on the deep-seated rock by many researchers[6-11]. However, the variable is rarely used to study on the mechanical behavior of rocks under loading-unloading conditions. |","Document Type

Modeling of discontinuities (fractures and fault surfaces) is of major importance to assess the geomechanical behavior of oil and gas reservoirs, especially for tight and unconventional reservoirs. Numerical analysis of discrete discontinuities traditionally has been studied using interface element concepts, however more recently there are attempts to use extended finite element method (XFEM). The development of an XFEM tool for geo-mechanical fractures/faults modeling has significant industrial potential; particularly within the hydrocarbon industry where it could lead to improved predictions for porosity/permeability changes in coupled geomechanical reservoirs. In this paper, we present a novel methodology based on the extended finite element method (XFEM) to analyze the behavior of pre-existing multiple strong discontinuities (faults and/or fractures) in reservoir rock. Detailed mathematical framework leveraging XFEM for multiple discontinuities in rock masses has been derived. This XFEM based framework is robust enough to represent strong discontinuities independently of the mesh. The approximation of discontinuities is constructed in terms of Heaviside/junction functions which lead to additional unknowns to capture the displacement jump across and at intersections of joints. Our framework and algorithm are general in nature and can handle complex geo-mechanical problems with different loading conditions. For validation of the implemented mathematical framework using XFEM, we analyze the behavior of a rock sample with multiple discontinuities and compare displacement and stress with known theoretical solution. Triaxial3D loading examples involving multiple discontinuities are also presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Modeling of big faults or planes of strong discontinuities is of major importance to assess the geomechanical behaviour of reservoirs. The presence of such discontinuities in rock mass possesses common characteristics on strength, deformability and development of a sudden jump in displacement field across the discontinuity and hence needs special attention for its inclusion in continuum mechanics. Numerical techniques to capture discontinuities basically fall into two categories depending on how the interface is represented: On the one hand, we have the explicit representation methods, such as the interface element methods and some possible related variants with classical references [1, 2], in which the fault is explicitly discretized with special elements inserted in-between element faces/edges. In this case additional degrees of freedom are introduced at the nodes to capture the discontinuous behaviour of the displacement field.|","Document Type

Multiscale characteristics of anisotropic, heterogeneous pore structure and compositional (e.g., kerogen, clay, cement, etc) distribution profoundly influence the hydro, mechanical, and chemical response of shale materials during stimulation and production. In this work the impact of these lithologic heterogeneities on physical, chemical, and mechanical properties is investigated over a micron to core scale of shale samples for Cretaceous Mancos Shale. Principal macroscopic lithofacies at a decimeter scale are petrographically examined. Thin sections (~2-3cm ) impregnated with fluorochromes are examined using laser scanning confocal microscopy and optical microscopy with different filters to characterize micro-facies (i.e., texture patterns) and using electron microprobe to identify the mineralogical distribution. Advanced multiscale image analysis for texture classification will be used to identify key features of samples which will be further analyzed using dual focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy, aberration corrected-scanning TEM and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry for nano-pore and organic-pore structures and mineralogies at nano scale. This characterization will be examined against experimental data including acoustic emission and nano-indentation measurements of elastic properties using focused ion-beam milled pillars. Finally, multiscale 3-D image stacks will be segmented to rigorously test the scale of a representative elementary volume based on multiple measures from image analysis and pore-scale simulations. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Shale gas recovery relies on the combined horizontal drilling and hydrofracturing, or “fracking” technologies, required to produce sufficient permeable pathways for gas to flow from these low permeability formations. Production rates progressively decline from slow diffusive transport in nanometer-sized pores, closure/collapse of fractures, and other factors [1]. Shales are unique among rock types and pose challenges for continuum scale modeling. This is both due to the low permeability, scaling of pore sizes, and compositional heterogeneity at all scales [2,3]. Multiscale characteristics of anisotropic, heterogeneous pore structure and compositional (e.g., kerogen, clay, cement, etc) distribution are critical to improving our understanding of large heterogeneity and variability between shale formations, uncertainties in the nature of the stimulated volumes, and the physics of what underlies the rapid decline in production rates. In this work the impact of these lithologic heterogeneities on physical, chemical, and mechanical properties is being investigated over a micron to core scale of shale samples for Cretaceous Mancos Shale.|","Document Type

M., Swiss Federal Institute of Technology| Amann, F., University of Alberta| Martin, C. D., University of Alberta| Wassermann, J., Universite de Cergy-Pontoise| David, C., Universite de Cergy-Pontoise| Barla, M., Politecnico di Torino","|Abstract
A series of laboratory tests on back-saturated specimens of Opalinus Clay was conducted to investigate the pore pressure response during undrained isotropic compression and elastic/inelastic shearing. Pore pressure measurements conducted during undrained loading utilizing a standard triaxial stress path suggest that pore pressure changes are primarily controlled by the transversal isotropic elastic behavior at low compressive loads, and the tendency of the clay shale to dilate as the differential stress exceeds the dilatancy threshold. In addition, both, poroelastic properties (i.e., Skempton’s pore pressure parameter B) and the tendency of the clay shale to dilate depend strongly on the confining stress. The stress path utilized in standard triaxial tests may substantially differ from the stress path associated with drilling or tunneling, and its influence on the effective strength is to date poorly understood. An alternative stress path used in this study, however, does not reveal significant differences with respect to strength or pore pressure evolution during shearing. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Clay shales are amongst the most difficult rock types in terms of characterizing their effective strength and stiffness properties and modeling their short- and long-term deformation associated with stress perturbation due to drilling or tunneling. Due to their often extremely low permeability, the response of clay shales to short-term loading or unloading (e.g. tunnel excavation) is essentially undrained and excess pore pressure (positive or negative) may develop with the tendency of the material to contract or dilate.
A series of undrained triaxial tests were conducted on Opalinus Clay samples to determine the pore pressure evolution during the elastic and inelastic behavior. This contribution explores the effect of confining stress on poroelastic properties, the confining stress dependent dilatancy and related pore pressure effect, and the influence of stress path on the pore pressure response.|","Document Type

This paper is based on a Monte Carlo simulation of a problem where a coal mine is divided into two sections (East and West) by a dyke such that the East section experiences no pillar failures while the West does despite having the same safety factor. This may prompt one to mine the East section at a lower safety factor arguing that the East section must be logically stronger compared to the West section. Probabilistic evaluation using Monte Carlo simulation is useful in clearing such misconceptions. It brings more light to the extent of dismissing (step by step) an argument which would have seemed to be originally reasonable (like in this paper). The simulation undertaken utilizes observations of road width, mining height and mining depth for both sections. A sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to select the most appropriate formula for solving the problem between the power formula and the linear formula. The linear formula was considered to be the best as it gave the same stability as the power formula but enabling mining to smaller pillar size. This enables stable, safe and sustainable utilization of mineral resources. A detailed analysis of both sections using the linear formula showed that contrary to one’s argument, both sections are over designed with actually the West section, which is failure ridden, being more over designed than the East section. West section failure is attributed to more variability in observations compared to the East section. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Probability and Risk in Rock Engineering is one of the crucial pieces which make up the Rock Engineering Puzzle. The Probabilistic approach enables Engineers to evaluate risk and make decisions within reliable confidence limits. Probability and Risk utilizes statistical observations and powerful assessment tools such as Monte Carlo simulation (MC), First order second moment solutions and fault tree diagrams in coming up with a solution to an engineering problem. This approach leads to justifiable designs such as slope stability, rock mass characterization, layout of underground excavations and design of support systems among others.|","Document Type

The primary objective of wellbore cement is to provide zonal isolation as a hydraulic barrier and ensure controlled fluid flow from the reservoir to the production facilities. During the lifetime of a well, cement has to cope with variations in stress, temperature and pressure. Frequent and dramatic oscillations of stress, temperature and pressure can cause damage within cement and its interfaces as well, which may leads to damage of cement sheath integrity, resulting in loss of zonal isolation and sustained casing pressure. This study investigated the effect of the mechanical compression and cyclic temperature variations on the mechanical properties of the cement, such as hardness and Young’s modulus; furthermore, this study included evaluation of cement slurries typically used in the deep drilling in the Gulf of Mexico US for cement compression.
Micro indentation tests were conducted on cement samples to evaluate the changes in mechanical properties with various cement designs. Analysis of indentation results on the cement samples showed: (a) a decrease in hardness and Young’s modulus right after compression while an overall increase one month after compression; (b) cyclic temperature variations significantly decreased neat cement hardness and Young’s modulus, but this effect varied when cement had other chemical additives; (c) hardness and Young’s modulus decreased after increasing water to cement ratio. Based on these results we are further investigating how to optimize cement slurries for field application that are characterized by thermal oscillation and under confined compression of cement sheath. 
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Wellbore CementThe main engineered hydraulic barrier in wellbores, cement sheath, can be subjected to many types of failures during the well life. The primary functions of wellbore cements are to provide zonal isolation, mechanical support of the metal pipe and prevent corrosion of metal component of wellbore system. Failures in cement sheaths can lead to the contamination of fresh water aquifer, migration of reservoir fluids from high pressure sands to low pressure sands, and sustained casing pressure as a result of fluid migration from the reservoir to the surface [1, 2]. The integrity of the wellbore cement sheath is a function of the mechanical properties of the hydrated cement, the geometry of the cased well and the properties of the surrounding formation [3]. During cementing operations, insufficient mud removal and improper cement placement might lead to weak bonding on both interfaces of the cement sheath. [4, 5]. Debonding may be caused by casing movement, pressure and/or temperature changes, and cement shrinkage. Pressure and temperature oscillations caused by completion and production operations contribute to the development of fractures and microannuli within the cement matrix [6]. Cement fractures created due to internal pressurization of the casing generally cause loss of annular zonal isolation in the lower quarter to third of the well, while large temperature changes cause cement sheath fracturing in the upper third to half of the well [7] . Both tensile and shear failures of the cement sheath have been shown to have a strong relationship with wellbore pressure and temperature [8]. |","Document Type

The passive-Vibration Assisted Rotary Drilling (p-VARD) technology was developed to enhance the drilling Rate of Penetration (ROP) for using Poly-crystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) drill bits by modulating the rock-bit interactions. A labscale p-VARD prototype was tested by drilling rock analogue fine-grained concrete samples with an Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) ~50 MPa. Results showed that within the operational range of the tool, defined by the range of WOB applied during drilling, ROP was consistently 50% or more greater as compared to conventional drilling without the p-VARD tool, as other drilling conditions being the same. A field-scale p-VARD prototype was developed and tested during field trials in September 2014. Evaluation of data from the field trials is ongoing; however, representative drilling results for drilling a red shale formation (with mechanical properties similar to the laboratory concrete material) showed similar results with ROP increased 50% to 100% when WOB was in the operational range of the tool.
1. INTRODUCTION
By studying Vibration Assisted Rotary Drilling (VARD), the Advance Drilling Laboratories (ADL) of Memorial University of Newfoundland aims to introduce technologies that provide higher penetration rates and greater economic values in the process of drilling. Vibrations are mostly considered undesirable in the field of drilling and efforts are done to mitigate them. Vibrations are linked to whirl, stick-slip and nonuniform dynamic loading, which cause damage to bits and down-hole equipment. The Institute of Technical Mechanics, Ukraine tested devices that work on the principle of cavitation. A two to three times increase in ROP was reported [1]. Another study was done on an Axial Oscillation Generator tool (AGT) and it was found that the AGT improves weight transfer to the bit and reduces torque on bit. Also it was found that it significantly reduces stick-slip [2]. National Oil-well Varco Down-hole Ltd. (NOV) developed a small scale vibration test-rig, to simulate stick-slip and study stickslip mitigation methods. Axial friction reduction and axial load transfer can be achieved by introducing axial excitations in the oil-well, which results in an improvement in ROP and better Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) [3]. Heng Li et al reported that the combined effect of vibrations and rotation increases the rate of penetration for a coring bit [4]; also ROP improvement was reported as a function of amplitude of vibrations. Babatunde et al studied the effect of vibration frequency on penetration rates using natural diamond drag bits. Here again VARD improved the penetration rates [5]. Both Heng Li et al and Babatunde et al used a shaker table under the sample as a source of vibrations. To further study the effect of vibrations on drilling performance, a prototype in-line tool (lab scale p-VARD tool) was designed and tested. Initial results were promising and significant increase in ROP using concrete specimens of medium strength was observed.|","Document Type

P., University of North Florida| Hudyma, N., University of North Florida","|Abstract
Although JRC profiles are commonly used for shear strength assessment of rock joints, they can also serve as a base model for weathering assessment. In this study, JRC profiles were characterized using eight promising roughness algorithms from diverse fields such as geomorphology, rock mechanics and signal processing. Roughness indices of digitized JRC profiles were assessed at three different sampling intervals to observe how scale impacts their correlation with JRC. Plots of JRC versus roughness indices exhibit one of two general shapes: either a generally (but sometimes monotonically increasing) curve with occasional small peaks at JRC 6-8 and JRC 12-14 or a bimodal shape that peaks consistently at JRC 10-12 and JRC 14-16 followed by a sudden drop in roughness. Z2 and Mean Absolute Angle show the highest linearity of the eight algorithms. Z2 has been used numerous times to assess JRC profiles but Mean Absolute Angle is a new and promising roughness algorithm. Standard Deviation (<U+03C3>) and Signal Energy (Es) demonstrate remarkable consistency between sampling intervals but their relative non-linearity with JRC suggests they are insufficient in quantifying roughness. A new JRC relationship, based on Z2 and intercept of the log-log plot of Z2 versus sampling interval, is presented
1. INTRODUCTION
Roughness and associated shear strength of discontinuities has long been an important aspect of rock engineering. One of the first studies relating normal force and joint roughness to shear behavior was conducted by Patton [1]. As this research progressed, joint roughness became an input into rock mass classification systems. All students, practitioners, and researchers in the field of rock mechanics are familiar with the joint roughness coefficient profiles (JRC) developed by Barton and Choubey [2]. This seminal tool has been instrumental in the development of roughness and shear strength assessment of discontinuities.
Quantifying roughness using various algorithms to compute roughness indices (RI) is far from a novel idea and has been explored very soon after the publication of the JRC profiles. However, agreement is seldom found in regards to the proper roughness index [3, 4, 5, and 6], discretization methods such as sampling interval selection [4, 7, 8, and 9], and even the statistical nature of the JRC profiles and other rough surfaces [10 and 11], proving that the task can be deceptively complex. As such, the particulars of proper JRC roughness assessment are still being openly discussed.|","Document Type

B., Montana State University| Spangler, L., Montana State University| Hiebert, R., Montana Emergent Technologies| Kirksey, J., Schlumberger Carbon Services| Esposito, R., Southern Company","|Abstract
Novel strategies aimed at increasing underground storage security by sealing unwanted leakage pathways near wellbores are currently under development. One such strategy is to engineer the process known as microbially-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) to achieve mineral-based sealing of fractures and reduction of permeability. Laboratory-based MICP research reported herein has demonstrated the ability to effectively reduce permeability in multiple 2.54 cm (1 inch) diameter Berea sandstone cores, seal fractures in shale cores, and seal a hydraulically fractured, 74 cm (29 inch) diameter sandstone core. This research involves integration of experimental testing and simulation modeling. In all experiments reported, Sporosarcina pasteurii biofilms were established and an injection strategy developed to optimize CaCO3 precipitation induced via enzymatic urea hydrolysis. Permeability reductions of 3-5 orders of magnitude were demonstrated. A field demonstration project successfully sealed a fractured sandstone formation located 341 m (1118 feet) below ground surface with MICP using conventional field delivery technology. MICP is a developing novel technology with the potential to seal fractures to reduce the risk of leakage from the subsurface. 
1. INTRODUCTION
To manage the environmental risk of storing carbon dioxide in geologic formations, unconventional oil & gas resource development and nuclear waste disposal, novel methods are needed to prevent leakage of subsurface fluids to functional overlying drinking water aquifers or the ground surface. One method currently being explored on multiple scales (from laboratory to field) is the use of microbially-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) [1-8]. This method utilizes microbes that have the capability to alter the chemical environments in host rock pore spaces. One example is the use of ureolytic microorganisms that produce enzymes to create saturation conditions favorable for promoting MICP [9- 11]. MICP has been proposed for a number of subsurface engineering applications including preventing gas leakage by sealing fractures to secure geologic storage of CO2 or other fluids, improving wellbore integrity, and stabilizing fractured and unstable porous media [3, 6, 12-16].|","Document Type

Experimental studies of shale cores of different orientations have been performed to compare the angular dependence of dynamic moduli acquired at ultrasonic frequencies with static moduli (Young’s moduli and Poisson ratios) obtained during initial loading and during subsequent unload – reload cycles. The data show that the dynamic moduli by far exceed their static counterparts. Dispersion explains part of this behavior: Dynamic moduli measured at seismic (10 Hz) frequency are significantly smaller than ultrasonic moduli, but reasonably similar to stiffnesses obtained from finite stress cycles. The difference between moduli obtained during initial loading and during stress cycles is largely caused by non-elastic behavior. 
1. INTRODUCTION
While anisotropy has become state-of-the-art in geophysics for petroleum exploration and monitoring [1, 2], it is often neglected in geomechanical applications to petroleum engineering. For example, shales are known to exhibit pronounced anisotropy, which has significant impact on e.g. hydraulic fracture growth and borehole instabilities caused by failure of rock around the hole.
The incorporation of anisotropy in geomechanical analysis is however limited by availability of data: Full anisotropic characterization requires either laboratory tests on several cores with different orientations, or procedures to convert anisotropic velocity data from seismic or sonic log data to static moduli. This is hampered by the fact that static and dynamic moduli may be quite different [3, 4], and that there is as yet no established theory that enables us to link the two sets of mechanical parameters. |","Document Type

In order to estimate the changes in fracture aperture under various long-term confining and thermal conditions, measurements of the fracture aperture are conducted using microfocus X-ray CT (µX-ray CT). Through the imaging data, the height of the fracture surface and the contact points are evaluated, and contact ratios for the fracture, the JRC and the aperture distribution are estimated. On the other hand, measurements are also conducted using a laser scan profile sensor, and some parameters are estimated. In comparing these parameters, the validity of the µX-ray CT data and an analysis of the data will be discussed. In addition, a fracture flow simulation will be conducted using the surface roughness and aperture data obtained by the µX-ray CT. 
1. INTRODUCTION
It is well known that for a rock fracture under various thermal and stress conditions, a reduction in permeability occurs due to chemical and mechanical compaction. The chemical and mechanical compaction may include a pressure solution and a reduction in permeability could be explained by this pressure solution [1]-[5]. Yasuhara, et al. [6] conducted flow-through experiments on a single fracture in granite under controlled temperature and stress conditions. Specifically, two different experiments, short-term and long-term, were performed to examine the influence of the loading time on the evolution of fracture permeability. The measured changes in fracture permeability showed reversible and irreversible behaviors under short-term and long-term conditions, respectively. These results indicated that the surface roughness and the structure of a fracture may be changed by pressure solution. However, no change in the fracture structure could be directly obtained. A change in the hydraulic conductivity was indirectly obtained.
The joint surface roughness is basically measured with a non-contact laser scan profiler or a CCD camera, and then, high quality profiling data can be obtained. On the other hand, the fracture roughness and the aperture distributions of a single rock fracture under certain confining stress conditions have not been evaluated, although it is very important that a measurement system is developed to measure these parameters under confining stress conditions. Measuring the joint surface roughness and the aperture distribution is not enough to obtain the height of surface roughness, the contact conditions and the aperture distribution under confining stress conditions.|","Document Type

A vast number of experimental and numerical studies have been performed in the literature to understand the fracturing process in brittle rocks under uniaxial compression; several types of cracks including tensile, shear, and combined tensile-shear have also been observed at the tip of pre-existing flaws. In this study, numerical simulations of a single oriented flaw in brittle rock materials in uniaxial compression were carried out using the extended finite element method (XFEM) and the displacement discontinuity method (DDM). The code FROCK was used for DDM simulations and the ABAQUS commercial package was used for the XFEM simulations. FROCK uses stress-based criteria in which the crack initiation is a function of the local stress relative to the strength of the material. In XFEM analysis, the maximum principal stress (MAXPS) failure criterion, assuming crack initiation and propagation in the direction perpendicular to the maximum principal stress, was used. The results from numerical simulations and experimental studies were in good agreement when predicting wing (tensile) cracks at the tip of the flaw. The stress intensity factors obtained from FROCK and XFEM were close to the values obtained from the closed-form solutions. However, the numerical simulations only predicted tensile cracks and failed to predict the shear cracks.
1. INTRODUCTION
The understanding of brittle rock failure in uniaxial compression is an important issue in rock engineering and petroleum engineering due to its applications in earthquake physics, rockburst in mining, wellbore stability, hydraulic fracturing, geothermal reservoirs, among others [1]. Several studies have addressed the deformation and fracture characteristics of brittle rocks under uniaxial compression, identifying the following main stages in the failure process [2-5]: (1) crack closure occurring during the initial stages when pre-existing microcracks close; (2) linear elastic deformation behavior after microcracks close, (3) crack initiation and stable crack growth, (4) critical energy release, crack propagation, and unstable crack growth, and (5) failure and post-peak stage. Crack initiation and growth result in the non-linear deformation behavior of the rock mass; thus, it is critical to study the crack initiation and propagation processes in brittle rock under uniaxial compression.|","Document Type

In Brazilian test, applied diametrical compression stress induces indirect tensile stresses normal to the vertical plane crossing through the rock disc and the ultimate failure occurs at the place where the maximum tensile stress is concentrated. The mechanical behaviour of rock with pre-existing cracks under static loading has been studied widely. In this study, the fracturing behaviour of Brisbane Tuff, under static and cyclic loading has been analysed applying an ISRM standard Cracked Chevron Notched Brazilian Disc (CCNBD) geometry. Specifically, X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) techniques have been used to investigate the fracturing behaviour of rocks under static and cyclic loading. The fracturing behaviour of rocks technically depends on the nature of loading, strength of mineral and text of rocks. Laboratory observations demonstrated that there is a distinct difference in fracturing between the static and cyclic loading. It was found that the cyclic loading had an important effect on microfracture propagation through the Fracture Propagation Zone (FPZ).p>
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock cutting is a common rock breakage, or excavation mechanism in tunneling, mining, well drilling and road construction projects. Understanding of rock brittle failure and propagation of cracks under the applied cutting loads is significant for rock engineers to investigate cuttability, crushing effect and production efficiency in rock fragmentation process. A considerable amount of literature has been published in rock fracture modeling, however, large amounts of the research have been published based on the experimental and mathematical models developed based on the elastic fracture mechanics. The first prediction model was established based on the maximum tensile stress theory by Evans [1]. Later, Roxborough and Philips [2] modified Evans model for various rocks and found correlation between the rolling forces, disc diameter, edge angle and penetration rate. According to the experimental studying, brittleness index was established as a function of uniaxial compressive and tensile stress [3]. Alehossien and Hood [4] proposed a linearized dimensional model to predict rock cutting forces based on the linear model. Non-linear and multi-linear predictive model were suggested by Tiryaki [5]. Amongst the different models of cutter tools, drag picks are more efficient as they attack rock in the tension mode and undercut by the lower magnitudes of forces compared to the shearer or compressive cutters. Rock cutting and fragmentation is essential for rock breakage process and forming different sizes of fragments, chips and particles during the rock excavation. As most rocks are weaker under tensile loading, applying tensile stress for rock breakage is the premise for new cutters. Moreover, rock initial flaws and cracks are locations for stress concentration, and play an important role for further fracturing and damage by coalescence and propagation. In brittle fracture mechanics, stress intensity factor and critical fracture toughness are the most fundamental parameters used for determining fracture propagation, energy release rate, and crack extension driving forces. Typical brittle fracture in rock is characterized by compressive or tensile tests, and post-failure behavior can be explained as the brittleness index for rock. However, under cyclic loading, the fatigue life of rock depends upon both frequency and amplitude of the cyclic loading [6-8]. Crack tip characteristic parameters are generally governed by the crack tip stress components and displacement functions to determine crack propagation analysis. The critical fracture toughness can be obtained experimentally according to the suggested methods of International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) in a different ways that listed and compared in Table 1.|","Document Type

We present a new definition of a brittleness index which is used as a criterion for candidate selection of rock intervals for hydraulic fracturing. The new index is a combination of material strength parameters and insitu stresses. It was derived from an analytical model of hydraulic fracturing in weak formations of varying ductility. The model is based on Mohr-Coulomb dislocations that are placed in the effective centres of the complete slip process that is distributed around the crack tip. The new brittleness index varies between 0 and 1 with the one limit to correspond to brittle propagation and the other limit to a fracture that requires infinite energy release per unit advance. The values between 0 and 1 correspond to fracture propagation of increasing ductility from brittle to small scale and finally to large scale yielding. The results are particularly interesting for predicting the propagation of axial fractures in the horizontal direction and their confinement in the vertical direction. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The Brittleness index of rocks is often used as a criterion for candidate selection of rock intervals for hydraulic fracturing in shale reservoirs [1]. Several definitions for measuring the brittleness of the rocks were proposed based on different mechanical properties of rocks that are derived from the stress-strain curve or from correlations with physical properties [2, 3, 4]. An inherent problem with some proposed definitions, which are based on simple definitions that were not derived from scientific principles but from correlations that are fitted on dynamic measurements, is that they do not follow the expected trend with some varying parameters such as the confining pressure [1]. Therefore, in unconventional shale reservoirs it is important to understand how brittleness can be represented and be used for practical applications of hydraulic fracturing. An extended report and comparisons of 9 different definitions of brittleness numbers based on uniaxial, triaxial and Brazilian tests on gas shale and overburden analogues were presented in [5].|","Document Type

Since a decade, observations and experiments conducted in underground environments worldwide (mines, underground research laboratories - URL) allowed to bridge the scale gap between laboratory scale and large scale faults. This is particularly important in the study of faults affecting clay formations which could not be observed at the Earth’s surface because of weathering processes. Here we show how examples from the Mont Terri (Switzerland) and Tournemire (France) URLs may help in (i) defining the concepts of fault architecture in shales, and (ii) estimating fault hydromechanical properties from decameter scale field experiments. Some key results are that critically stressed shale faults can be reactivated with little stress changes in the range of those produced by shallow underground excavations, and that micrometer-to-millimeter scale reactivations may lead to an increased permeability of one order of magnitude without generating any noticeable seismicity. This appears to be related to complex multi-scale geological processes linked to fault history such as differential hardening, partial sealing, pressure solution and gouge development within the fault zones rather than to the regional state of stress. Such results are important in evaluating fault seal integrity in oil and gas exploration, production or CO2 storage or monitoring underground excavations for deep geological repositories. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Little is known about the rock mechanical characteristics of pre-existing tectonic faults and their influence on rock mass properties and behavior in clay rocks. Underground research laboratories provide exceptional conditions to observe unaltered fault zones in shales and to perform relatively well constrained experiments. Studies on induced macroscopic fracturing around tunnels in faulted shale indicate that reactivation of tectonic faults as a consequence of excavation-induced stress redistributions play an essential role in the development of the Excavation Damage Zone (EDZ) fracture network [1-4]. Hence, faults significantly alter the homogeneity of the rock mass in strength, stress and deformability, and thus have a significant effect on induced fracturing. |","Document Type

Any bord and pillar platinum mine thrives on effective design of bords and pillars. Pillars have to be large enough to ensure safety and small enough to ensure economic and sustainable exploitation of the mineral resource. Consideration of span of the bords of the working area is also crucial to safe and economic design of the mining layout. This research makes a critical review of the current design approach so as to understand the contributors to pillar failure in a section of an underground platinum bord and pillar mine. The research focuses on the areas that have been plagued by bad ground and seeks to determine the suitability of the current design in such conditions with an objective to redesign the section so as to curb the consequences of pillar failure in the operation. At the core of this research is the detailed geotechnical data of the area that was studied. Making use of Rock Mass Classification (RMC) and other rock engineering techniques, the review indicates that the adopted design is not suitable for the ground conditions evaluated, thus confirming the problem’s origin. The safety factor analysis shows that the ground conditions in the area of study would pose a greater risk due to failure of pillars. The conditions, predominantly the closer joint spacing made the rock mass deteriorate in strength and quality thus the pillar size needed to be increased so as to maintain the required strength. This shows that the pillars in the study area are at a higher risk of failure hence motivating for the redesign process. This paper details the proposed redesign which, if implemented, is expected to see a reduced extraction ratio but will enhance stability and facilitate optimum mining operations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Accurate pillar design and stability analysis are crucial to safe mining in a bord and pillar layout. This paper makes a critical review of the current bords and pillar design and layout at a platinum mine in Zimbabwe which has been affected by ground failure. The mine is located on the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe and exploits an orebody which is not deeper than 500m below surface for Platinum Group Elements (PGEs). While PGEs are the main minerals of interest and extraction at the mine, copper, nickel and gold are also recovered from the operation. The mine is located in a block delineated by two faults in a fairly stable region. Regionally, the geology at the mine is similar and consistent with the rest of the Great Dyke. Locally, the orebody lies at the bottom of the main sequence of sulphide bearing rocks and is about 1.2m above a footwall fault (FWF) that occurs consistently throughout the mining environment. The fault infill material is known to negatively affect the metallurgical process through which the ore is taken to recover PGEs. Due to the clayey nature of its infill material, the fault presents a high risk on regional support (pillars) especially where it coincides with the footwall of mining excavations and can be subjected to water flows.|","Document Type

In uniaxial compression the end constraint has a large influence on the geometry effect of rocks. However, the relationship between the end constraint and the geometry effect and their combined effects on the post-peak behavior of rocks are poorly understood. In the present study, a numerical experiment of rock specimens with different geometries in 3D uniaxial compression was carried out. Specimen geometry (slenderness and shape) and contact properties (loading stiffness and friction) were considered in the simulation. It is found that in the absence of the end constraint, the post-peak behavior of rocks depends on the specimen slenderness, implying that the slenderness effect can be an intrinsic geometry effect of Mohr-Coulomb material such as rocks. Next, it is shown that the end constraint enhances the post-peak strength of rocks by inducing confined zones in the specimen, and the size of the confined zones increases as the specimen slenderness decreases. Furthermore, it is observed that it is the slenderness rather than the cross sectional shape of a rock specimen that is closely related to the end constraint; therefore, the slenderness dominates the geometry effect of rocks in laboratory test results. Finally, it is confirmed that there is a critical value of H/W ratio where the specimen is least affected by the end constraint. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Obtaining complete stress-strain curves of rocks is important for rock strength characterization in laboratory and pillar design in deep underground mines [1]. End constraint is initiated under compression at specimen-platen contacts in rock laboratory tests due to the elastic mismatch between the rock specimen and the steel loading platen [2, 3]. Although different testing apparatus and approaches have been employed to minimize the influence of the end constraint on rock property testing [4-6], it is practically impossible to exclude the end constraint from rock tests [7]. Therefore, it is important to study the influence of end constraint on the post-peak behavior of rocks in compression.
End constraint at the specimen-platen contacts mainly consists of two aspects: loading machine stiffness along the normal direction of the contact and friction across the surface of the contact. In most previous studies on the investigation of the friction effect on peak strength of rocks, a plane stress condition was usually assumed, which is inconsistent with the boundary condition in laboratory tests [7-10]. Furthermore, the effects of loading machine stiffness and friction on the post-peak behavior of rocks were not considered together [11]. Hence, the relationship between the end constraint and the geometry effect and their combined effect on the post-peak behavior of rocks are poorly understood. Therefore, a three dimensional (3D) model that can realistically consider the stiffness and friction properties of the specimen-platen contact is needed to better capture the post-peak behavior of rocks in compression.|","Document Type

S., Catholic University of Pernambuco| Lima, A., Federal University of Pernambuco| Guimaraes, L. J. N., Federal University of Pernambuco| Gomes, I., Federal University of Pernambuco","|Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the horizontal stress evolution and soil collapse during the cement dissolution process using a combination of experimental and numerical methods. The experimental procedure was carried out using a modified oedometer cell with horizontal stress measurements and synthetic samples in order to simulate simultaneous cement dissolution, stress changes and sample deformation. The samples were loaded at a constant vertical stress and exposed to a reactive fluid which dissolved the cementation of the artificial soil. During the dissolution process, sample volume decreased and horizontal stress changes were observed. Initially the horizontal stress decreased due to grain mass loss and then increased due to solid matrix rearrangement. Numerical simulation of these coupled chemical and mechanical processes was performed using a general purpose finite element code capable of performing numerical analysis of engineering problems. The constitutive model adopted to reproduce the sample behavior is an extension of the Barcelona Basic Model for unsaturated soils including the cement mineral concentration as state variable. Some new features were incorporated to the original elasto-plastic model in order to represent the results observed in the experiments. Encouraging agreement has been found concerning the validation of the proposed formulation. 
1. INTRODUCTION|Some geotechnical problems that are likely to require new approaches or, at least, extension of the classical ones are as follows: collapse and expansion of active soils, subsidence due to oil and gas extraction, dissolution, degradation and weathering of soils and rocks and CO2 sequestration [1]. For instance, the large-scale injection of CO2<sub> and other gases into geological formations may induce complex interaction of multiphase flow, diffusion, convection, mineral and gas dissolution, mineral precipitation, and other chemical reactions. Depending on the composition of the rock and fluids and CO2 injection strategy, the rock-fluid interactions may have a significant impact on safety and reservoir storage capacity [2]. |","Document Type

Q., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)| Moradian, Z., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)| Goncalves da Silva, B., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)| Germaine, J. T., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","|Abstract |Hydraulic fracturing has become increasingly prevalent in the oil and gas industry as well as in enhanced geothermal systems as a method to increase the permeability of rock masses. However, the process is still not very well understood in terms of the fracture mechanisms that occur as cracks initiate, propagate and coalesce. Laboratory tests can be useful in this regard as they provide insights into fracture behaviour during hydraulic loading under controlled conditions. This paper describes the development of an acoustic emissions setup capable of capturing a stream of data over approximately five seconds corresponding to crack initiation and propagation. |The AE setup was used in a series of hydraulic fracturing experiments on granite specimens. It was found that for one particular specimen, few emissions were observed until the applied water pressure reached 90% of the failure pressure. After this point it was observed that low energy emissions were produced at a constant rate until approximately 0.1s before failure, whereupon a series of higher energy emissions occur. These higher energy emissions were compared to high speed video taken at 15 000 fps, and it was observed that significant local white patching (microcracking) occurred in this time period. Finally, crack initiation appears to be related to the onset of a high amplitude emission with a duration of 0.3s, as observed using high speed video. |1. INTRODUCTION |It is a well-known phenomenon that the rate of acoustic emissions increases close to the time at which shear failure occurs [1]. This is particularly true in brittle materials, where the rate of emissions often exceeds that which can be handled by the acquisition system [2], [3]. |AE systems have traditionally had issues recording data at the time of a fracturing event due to hit based architecture, where the system acquires data in discrete segments and requires time to re-arm after every hit. It is possible to circumvent this problem by use of a continuous waveform recorder [4], however in such an approach the data only span a limited time window due to memory limitations. Consequently, any longer experiment would require a separate hit based acquisition system to acquire data in the early phase of the experiment. The main disadvantages of such a setup is that splitting the sensor signal into two acquisition systems increases the electronic noise in all voltage readings, the continuous data can often consume significant memory space, and analysis can become more difficult due to sheer volume of data. As a result, it would be ideal to develop a single acquisition system with both hit-based and continuous modes of operation.|",""

Rock mass classification (RMC) plays a pivotal role in the design of excavations in both civil and mining engineering. It is a quick and an uncomplicated powerful tool to assess stability of excavations as well as the support requirements of the same. Rock mass deformation properties can also be determined using RMC systems. While it is so easy to use them, one needs to have the requisite technical skills to comprehend the theory underlying each classification system together with its limitations. This approach in using rock mass classification systems minimize abuse and ensures maximum benefit from them. The author also briefly discussed some of the ways to address serious concerns about RMC systems.
1. INTRODUCTION
The mining engineering fraternity strives to achieve safe, fast and economic extraction of mineral resources. Rock mass classification is one of the powerful tools to this end. While Rock Mass Classification (RMC) techniques like Rock Mass Excavability (RME) index, Q system, Geological Strength Index (GSI), Terzaghi’s rock load approach, Bieniawski’s RMR system, Laubscher’s MRMR system, Potvin stability graph method, Barton’s QTBM, Mark and Molinda’s Coal Mine Roof Rating (CMRR) and the Rock Wall Condition Factor among others have gained wide spread use, they must be used with great care and caution if users are to get workable solutions from them. RMC systems are like a pencil handled in an artist’s hand calling for greater skill and experience in order to leave an artful impression. One needs to beware of the limitations of each system and its areas of applicability before attempting to use it. It must be noted that RMC systems have to work hand in glove with laborious engineering design in order to come up with a workable solution. RMC systems should complement more sophisticated and detailed design procedures [1]. In the goal to realise workable solutions in engineering including classification of rocks, [2] point out that technical skills are among major strategic issues to be considered. Like other approaches there is risk associated with making RMC approaches part of our designs. This risk has to make part of our decision criterion as advised by [3]. This way, RMC systems become reliable, fast, easy and much less complicated means of addressing design needs.|","Document Type

The rate dependence of dry, oil- or water-saturated high-porosity outcrop chalk is investigated based on whether the fluid effect could be excluded from a governing material parameter, the b-factor. The b-factor is used in geotechnical engineering to establish the difference in evolution of load between stress-strain curves when applying different loading rates. The material investigated is outcrop chalk from Stevns, Southern part of Denmark, with a porosity of 43 to 44% and subjected to varying loading rates. The Biot critical frequency is a function of the fluid properties viscosity and density, and the material properties porosity and permeability. The critical frequency is interpreted as a measure of the solid-fluid friction and hence relevant to use for subtracting the fluid effect to arrive at a pure material parameter. The results show a correlation between the b-factor and the Biot critical frequency.
1. INTRODUCTION
For hydrocarbon reservoir behavior upscaling from laboratory results to field behavior is important. One of the central parameters which are challenging to apply in the laboratory is the low strain or stress rate involved. These can range from as much as 1 %/hour for the laboratory tests to 10–4%/hour for a hydrocarbon reservoir under depletion [1]. Thus upscaling parameters measured in the laboratory is important. The time dependence is vital as it affects both the strength and the deformation such that a slow loading results in a weaker material response and a faster loading rate yields a higher strength and a stiffer response. Dealing with the time effect is exemplified by Rhett [2] for the Ekofisk Field, and by de Waal and Smits [3] for Goose Creek, Wilmington, Inglewood, Nigata, Boliva coast, and Groningen fields.|","Document Type

The interaction between hydraulic fractures (HF) and natural fractures (NF) will lead to complex fracture networks due to the branching and merging of natural and hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs. In this paper, a newly developed hydraulic fracturing simulator based on discrete element method is used to predict the generation of complex fracture network in the presence of pre-existing natural fractures. By coupling geomechanics and reservoir flow within a dual lattice system, this simulator can effectively capture the poro-elastic effects and fluid leakoff into the formation. When HFs are intercepting single or multiple NFs, complex mechanisms such as direct crossing, arresting, dilating and branching can be simulated. Based on the model, the effects of injected fluid rate, viscosity, NF orientation, NF permeability, NF cohesion and stress anisotropy on the HF-NF interaction process are investigated. Combined impacts from multiple parameters are also examined in the paper. The numerical results show that large values of stress anisotropy, intercepting angle, injection rate and viscosity will impede the opening of NFs.
1. INTRODUCTION
According to the microseismic observations, hydraulic induced fractures in shale reservoir often deviate from the conventional bi-wing fracture geometry and lead to complex fracture network, which may be caused by stress shadow effect from multiple hydraulic fractures (HFs) or interaction with pre-existing natural fractures (NFs). It has been demonstrated that the widespread presence of natural fractures in most shale formation will significantly impact the induced fracture pattern. Understanding the interaction between HF and NF plays a crucial role in quantifying the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and optimizing the well completion strategy. 
As shown in Figure 1, there are several possibilities that might occur when hydraulic fractures intersect with natural fractures[1,2]: 
(1) The hydraulic fracture directly crosses the natural fracture and keeps propagating with its original direction; 
(2) The hydraulic fracture crosses the natural fracture with an offset, where hydraulic fracture will deflect into the natural fracture for a certain distance and resume its propagation along the maximum stress direction at some weak points of natural fracture;|","Document Type

This paper presents the results of a laboratory study aimed at assessing the influence of indexation (the ratio of the bit angular velocity over the activation frequency) and impact energy on the performance of percussive drilling. A block of Kuru grey granite is subjected to sequential impacts with a O33mm seven-button drill bit driven by a drop machine. The force versus displacement curve is obtained through a strain gauge located on the impacting tup and the volume of removed rock is captured by taking a rubber specimen of the drilling bottom-hole, cleaned by air-flushing, after each impact. These two measurements enable to investigate the link between the penetration of the bit after each impact and the average rate of penetration of the bit after multiple impacts. Understanding and quantifying the dependence of these relationships on indexation and impact energy will lead to the formulation of more realistic bit/rock interface laws that implicitly account for repeated impacts of the bit on the rock.
1. INTRODUCTION|Down-the-hole (DTH) percussive drilling is a widely used technology to complete boreholes in hard rock formations. This technology consists in applying repetitive impacts on a continuously rotating drill bit (Lindqvist, 1984; Hustrulid and Fairhurst, 1971). At each impact, compressive waves travel the drill bit down to the rock material, which enable the bit penetration by indentation of the drill bit buttons into the rock material. Crushing of the rock occurs right under the indenter and consumes most of the energy provided to the drill bit (Saksala et al., 2014). However, most of the material removal is achieved by the formation of larger rock fragments from lateral cracks. Indeed, this so called chipping process creates craters that are larger than the bit button marks i.e. rock is fragmented and removed under and between the buttons (Lindqvist and Lai, 1983). This process requires (i) a minimum amount of impact energy (Saksala et al., 2014) and (ii) a rotation of the drill bit between each impact. This work is motivated by the recognition that despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies (Hustrulid and Fairhust, 1971; Lundberg, 1973a, 1973b; Kou et al., 1995), the dependence of the penetration rate on indexation and impact energy remains poorly understood. A subsidiary issue that we address is the link between the penetration of the bit after each impact and the average penetration rate of the bit after multiple impacts: due to the chipping of the rock, the observed rate of penetration (ROP) obtained during percussive drilling (PD) is larger than what could have been inferred from the penetration obtained with a single impact test made in laboratory. This relationship between the bit ROP and the button penetration depends on the indexation between two percussive activations and presumably also on the impact energy. Understanding the relations between average bit ROP and single impact bit penetration, and quantifying the dependence of these relationships on indexation and impact energy will lead to the formulation of more realistic bit/rock interface (BRI) laws that implicitly account for repeated impacts of the bit on the rock. Realistic BRI laws are critical for modeling the dynamical response of DTH percussive drilling systems (Depouhon, 2014; Depouhon et al., 2014).|","Document Type

Single digit percentage of oil shale recovery leaves a large room for recovery improvement, while aqueous phase injection into shale formation is extremely challenging. Injecting Carbon Dioxide (CO2) into oil shale formations can potentially improve oil recovery. Furthermore, the large surface area in the organic rich shale could permanently store CO2 volume without jeopardizing the formation integrity. This work is a study on evaluating the effectiveness of CO2 enhanced oil shale recovery and shale formation CO2 sequestration capacity. A compositional reservoir simulator is used to model CO2 injection. Petrophysical and fluid properties similar to the Bakken formation are used to set up the base model for simulation. The reservoir model considered petrophysical characteristics of shale formation that affects CO2 flow migration like in-situ stress changes, reservoir heterogeneity, and natural fractures. The results are based on sensitivity analysis of the characteristic shale petrophysical and geomechanical properties. Sensitivity analysis method analyzed all uncertain parameters together using the Design of Experiment and Response Surface Modeling approach to counter the interaction between parameters and influential parameters into generating a proxy model for optimizing oil recovery and CO2 injection into the formation. The above studies are implemented with and without geomechanical module and results are analyzed. The results show that facilitating oil recovery from shale reservoirs by CO2 injection is much higher than primary depletion depending on fracture network connectivity and geomechanical impact. Also, significant CO2 storage capacity if applicable in shale formations, will be a major step towards advances in CO2 sequestration in widely spread shale reservoirs. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Unconventional reservoir is a term to describe a hydrocarbon resource that could not be technically or economically recoverable without stimulation. Reservoir quality of tight formations is categorized as very poor because the ultra-low permeability restricts fluid movement within the reservoir. This leads to single digit oil recovery factors and costly development activities. Commercial development of low permeability, ultra-tight formations by advances in horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing techniques have led to the production of significant amount of hydrocarbons. A typical production profile of an unconventional tight oil formation is illustrated in Figure 1. The high initial production rates usually attribute to hydraulic fractures, and then oil rate declines steeply once the oil near the fractured zone is produced. Beyond this rate, the flow is mainly controlled by inter-porosity mass transfer between the matrix and fracture network. In literature we studied, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) for unconventional oil reservoirs are limited. |","Document Type

The feed rate of the natural building stone cutting processes is determined by the properties of the natural stone and the machine being used. The most significant factors that affect the feed rate during natural building stone cutting processes are the mineralogic and petrographic properties of the natural stone. The feed rate is determined by the operator, and is generally selected based on the operator’s own experience. Regardless of the type of stone being cut, the main goal of natural building stone cutting processes is to achieve an optimum feed rate, while also ensuring minimal power expenditure and tool wear. In this study, the cutting data for nine different natural building stone cutting processes classified under three different groups were investigated. The mineralogic and petrographic properties were determined for the natural stones being cut, and the effects of rock mineralogy on the optimum feed rate was evaluated based on the comparison of feed rates with these properties. In this context, the cutting processes of building stones consisting of marble, limestone, and travertine were evaluated. According to the study data, factors that played an important role in the selection of feed rate under industrial cutting conditions include the mineral structure of the rock, the mineral grain size, the porous structure of the rock, rock hardness, and the layer structure. Natural building stone cutting processes can generally be classified into three groups as low-speed, medium-speed, and high-speed cutting conditions. In each one of these groups, the cutting speeds are directly affected by the mineralogic and petrographic properties of the rock.
1. INTRODUCTION
The process of cutting dimensioned products from natural stone blocks requires the use of circular saw blades with very different diameters and characteristics. To ensure efficiency of production, it is important not only to select a saw blade that is suitable for the type of stone being cut, but also to operate the saw blade under suitable working parameters, in that the cutting of natural stone does not generally take place under ideal conditions [1]. One of the most important factors affecting the efficiency of natural stone cutting with circular saws is the feed rate. In addition to this, the life and performance of the saw are also affected by a number of different factors, the most important of these being the diamond and matrix properties (hardness of the metal bond formulation, grit size, diamond concentration and diamond type); the method used for manufacturing the segment; the applicable sawing conditions (cutting depth, cutting speed and feed rate); and the mineralogical and physico-mechanical properties of the stone being cut [2]. To ensure cutting under ideal conditions, it is necessary to carry out a detailed evaluation of all cutting conditions.|","Document Type

One of the major challenges during drilling in hard-brittle formation in Tarim basin is to evaluate the rock drillability and to predict the rate of penetration (ROP) accurately. The aim of this article is to analyze the drilling resistance of rock breaking and to predict the ROP from a new angle. In this paper, the fractal characteristic of rock fragmentation and the problem of rock energy consumption in drilling process are studied based on the fractal theory through rock-breaking laboratory experiment by roller cone bit and rock cuttings screening experiment. A new prediction model of energy consumption on rock fragmentation is proposed based on size distribution of rock cuttings, fractal dimensions, and energy dissipation analysis. Also, the prediction equation of ROP is given based on the principle of energy conservation. The biggest advantage of this model is that the energy consumption on rock fragmentation and the ROP can be predicted entirely based on rock cuttings, fractal dimensions and drilling parameters. According to field data analysis, the consistency, is encouraging, with an average error below 15%. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In drilling process, to make an accurate evaluation of rock drillability is an important basis for optimizing drilling parameters and determining drilling measures. Currently, many investigators have evaluated the rock drillability and predicted the ROP mainly from the perspective of rock drillability test indoor or drilling rate equation [3-6]. However, these methods are not only costly but also takes a long time; the ROP predictions are complicated and infeasible in field application.
Fractal geometry was originally developed by Mandelbrot to describe the highly irregular and self-similar objects, and then the fractal theory was applied to many other science fields [1, 8, 9]. In the field of rock comminution, numerous studies show that rock fragmentation has fractal characteristic; the fractal characteristic of cuttings reflects the rock crushing mechanism and energy dissipation process [2, 7, 8, 9]. In this paper, the size distribution of cuttings and drilling parameters are combined based on fractal geometry to develop a fractal model for energy dissipation of rock crushing. This model can be applied to determine the required minimum energy for rock breaking. Meanwhile, according to the principle of energy conservation, we can use this model to predict drilling speed. Therefore, the establishment of this model provides a new method for optimizing drilling parameters and improving drilling efficiency.|","Document Type

D., Sandia National Laboratories| Lampe, B., University of New Mexico| Mills, M., University of New Mexico| Stormont, J., University of New Mexico","|Abstract
Crushed salt is being considered as a backfill material in the event of a salt repository for high level nuclear waste. The thermal-mechanical-hydrological properties of crushed salt as it reconsolidates in response to pressure and temperature changes are therefore important. An experimental system to measure gas flow through consolidating crushed salt at elevated temperature and pressure has been developed and tested. An experiment completed at 250°C, and hydrostatic pressures to 20 MPa, compacted a crushed salt sample from ~40 percent porosity to near zero porosity. For this consolidation history, apparent permeability decreased from greater than 10-12 m2 to ~10-22 m2. 
1. INTRODUCTION
It is important to improve the understanding of the coupled thermal-mechanical-hydrologic response of granular (or crushed) salt used as a seal material for shafts, drifts, and boreholes in mined salt repositories. Granular salt consolidation is being investigated through an integrated program of laboratory measurements, observations, and constitutive model development and evaluation. In particular, we are focused on measuring the deformation and corresponding permeability reduction of granular salt as it consolidates to fractional densities greater than 0.90. Behavior at high fractional densities is of principal importance to repository applications because this is when the permeability of granular salt is expected to decrease to a condition comparable to intact salt, that is, it becomes nearly impermeable. An extension of an existing constitutive model is being developed using these data to allow prediction of changing properties as granular salt consolidates.
Rock salt has been considered as a potential disposal medium, because salt is essentially impermeable. The very existence of salt millions of years after deposition is proof that water has not flowed through the formation. The undisturbed formation permeability of salt is essentially too low to measure using traditional hydrologic and reservoir engineering methods. In undisturbed and healed salt, brine is not able to flow at rates that would lead to significant radionuclide mobilization and transport. In terms of disposal, one of the most important features of salt as an isolation medium is its ability to heal previously damaged areas. Damage recovery is often referred to as “healing” of fractures. The healing mechanisms include microfracture closure and bonding of fracture surfaces. Evidence for healing of fractures in salt has been obtained in laboratory experiments and through observations of natural analogs. Fracture healing can restore the low permeability of intact rock salt. The consolidation of granular rock salt is envisioned to occur under similar mechanisms to healing.|","Document Type

While numerous definitions of what makes Unconventional Plays ‘unconventional’ have been put forth, ranging from the reliance on horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing technology to the often ultra-low permeability of the matrix, a key characteristic of Unconventionals is the impact of geomechanics on hydraulic fracturing in reservoir formations with natural fractures and/or weakness planes (e.g., bedding planes). Critical geomechanics effects include the influence of: 1) all three principal stress magnitudes; 2) anisotropy in the stress magnitudes; 3) the orientation of the stress field; 4) in-situ pressure (e.g., pressure within the natural fractures and weakness planes); 5) natural fracture and weakness plane frequency and connectivity; 6) natural fracture and weakness plane orientation relative to the stress field; 7) natural fracture and weakness plane mechanical properties (elastic properties such as stiffness as well as strength properties such as cohesion and friction coefficient); 8) natural fracture and weakness plane initial aperture; and 9) the interaction with operational parameters during a hydraulic fracture stimulation (e.g., rate, volume, and viscosity). In this paper, the authors review the importance and impact of these critical geomechanical parameters on hydraulic fracturing design and effectiveness in Unconventionals. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Numerous definitions of what makes Unconventional Plays ‘unconventional’ have been put forth ranging from the reliance on horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing technology to the often ultra-low permeability of the matrix (as low as single-digit nanodarcy). However, an important key to Unconventionals is the impact of geomechanics on hydraulic fracturing in reservoir formations with natural fractures and/or weakness planes (e.g., bedding planes), which has often made hydraulic fracture design and implementation both challenging and inconsistent in Unconventionals.
While commercial hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for more than 65 years [1], hydraulic fracture design has been based upon the assumption that equal half-length, bi-planar fractures will develop since a dominant control on fracture length is fracture height growth, which itself is dominantly controlled by the vertical profile of the minimum in-situ principal stress, Shmin [2]. This assumption is often valid because hydraulic fractures are created using hydraulic energy, which acts omni-directionally, ensuring that hydraulic fracture propagation always follows the path of least resistance, which itself is often dominated by a laterally-uniform stress field. |","Document Type

B., GTEP PUC-Rio, Rio de Janeiro| Inoue, N., GTEP PUC-Rio, Rio de Janeiro| Anjos, J. L. R., Petrobras, Rio de Janeiro","|Abstract
Casing integrity is a major concern in wells drilled through salt zones due to the salt time-dependent behaviour. As wellbore closes, the trapped annular experience a pressure build-up that may subject casing to high loads, leading to its collapse. In this scenario, a big concern of the well design engineers is to predict whether or not the string will fail, and the consequences to the integrity of the production casing, which can lead to serious problems and possibly making any workover infeasible. Therefore this paper focus in the contribution of salt creep to the annular pressure build up (APB) phenomenon, and the consequences of wellbore closure in the integrity of both intermediary and production casings. The analyses involve FEM simulations of different case scenarios with considerations of fluid elements, which can account for fluid compressibility, i.e., pressure build-up as the wellbore closes and pressure relief as the casing collapses.
1. INTRODUCTION
Many reservoirs can be found beneath Salt formations. This occurrence is favorable because of Salt extremely low porosity and low permeability, which makes it a excellent sealing rock. In through-Salt environments, well integrity in long-term production is a great concern due to rock creep. For deep wells, where high temperature and high pressure are expected, a proper casing design has to be carefully analyzed so as to guarantee a safe operation until well abandonment.
When crossing Salt formations, intermediary casing has an extremely important role, as it must protect production casing from Salt-related problems. To assure production casing integrity, a series of studies have to be conducted so as to determine whether the casing configuration will withstand different types of loads over time. One of these studies is the analysis of the pressurization on the annulus above top of cement, which can lead to casing system collapse due to trapped drilling mud.|","Document Type

Shale rocks with high clay and carbonate content show time-dependent deformation at different conditions of stress. In this paper, we present a series of time-cycling triaxial deformation creep tests conducted on two samples from the Haynesville formation in east Texas. A power-law model was fit to all creep measurements to find the constitutive parameters of the time-dependent deformation of these samples. We obtained these constitutive parameters from triaxial creep experiments over time periods of 3-4 hours, one day, one week and 3-4 weeks. Although further experiments are needed, the experimental results obtained to date show that short-term creep tests are able to provide constitutive parameters that predict long-term deformation of these clay-rich shales. Both Young’s modulus and the viscoelastic properties are anisotropic, with the samples being more compliant and more viscoplastic when deformed normal to bedding.
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding time-dependent deformation in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs is one of the most difficult technical problems in the oil and gas industry. Viscous deformation can change both mechanical and fluid flow properties of shales, which are of primary importance in determining production capacity of shale gas reservoirs. Clay minerals may be significantly responsible for the inelastic deformation of shale rocks because of their high viscoelastic behavior [1, 2, 3, 4].
Several techniques have been used to determine the inelastic time-dependent deformation of rocks, among which uniaxial and triaxial creep experiments have been used widely [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The main problem with conducting these experiments is that time dependent essences of creep experiments make these tests costly and time consuming. Consequently, predicting the longterm inelastic deformation of rocks from short-time experiments has been a matter of interest to the scholars. 
In this study, we performed a series of conventional triaxial creep experiments on two clay-rich samples from the Haynesville shale formation to investigate the inelastic deformation process in shales. The triaxial experiments were performed in a time-cycling pattern on a horizontal and a vertical shale sample to understand the bedding orientation effects. This time-cycling pattern includes a series of multi-stage loading/unloading experiments at different time spans. The main goal of performing this type of experiment was to study the authenticity of the few-hours long creep experiments.|","Document Type

The resultant distributions of ground surface deformation simulated using different gridding algorithms are compared and some principles counter-intuitive to a usual work flow in analyzing ground surface heave induced by deep gas injection are studied. In addition, as a foundation to facilitate the decoupling strategy, an tractable interface is programmed to provide completely identical models as well as their discretization between reservoir flow simulation software CMG’s GEM and reservoir Geomechanics modelling package Itasca’s FLAC-3D. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Geomechanics is playing a significant role in assessing the leakage-proof security related near-field integrity and far-field manifestation, along with subsurface volume perturbation induced by pressure transients from its reservoir initial state to distribution driven by injected flows, particularly, e.g., in case of geological sequestration of carbon dioxide into deep saline aquifer [1]. Among the geomechanical responses to gas injection, an obvious mechanics is the inflation of reservoir. It is well known that effective stress acting on porous rocks can be simplified as the difference of total stress applied by regional tectonic stress and overburden weight subtracting the pore pressure [2], which means any increase in pore pressure caused by injection will reduce the effective stress acting on porous rocks [3], hence leading to reservoir inflation. In many cases, this change in depth transfers all the way and can reach the surface being manifested as extremely slight ground heave or sag. Though ground surface deformation falls into hardly detectable magnitudes, geodetic methods, such as tiltmeter array, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radae (In SAR), GPS surveying [4] as well as certain combination of these approaches, are usually feasible to monitor and reflect the reservoir pressure growth caused by CO2 plume spreading at reservoir depth.|","Document Type

A., Shell International Exploration and Production Inc.| Geilikman, M. B., Shell International Exploration and Production Inc.","|Abstract
An outstanding question in the design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment is how fractures, which often initiate in non-ideal orientations under the influence of near-field stress concentrations, propagate outwards and turn towards their ideal orientations under the far-field stress conditions. Using a fully coupled 2D/3D Finite Element hydraulic fracturing model in GEOS, we simulate fracture initiation and propagation for three distinct cases. First, we consider the growth of a simple bowl shaped fracture near a free surface. The numerical results are compared against recently published experimental results and are used to calibrate the model response. Second, we consider the growth of an infinitely long axial fracture from a vertical wellbore for a range of stress states, fracture orientations, and fluid characteristics. Finally, we consider the case where a discrete axial fracture from a horizontal wellbore propagates outward and transitions to a transverse fracture.
1. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we consider the mechanisms that govern the initiation and growth of hydraulic fractures from an uncased horizontal wellbore. This is a challenging problem because the solution extends over a wide range of scales in solid and fluid dynamics. At the onset of the problem, the fluid in the wellbore is slowly pressurized until the resulting tensile hoop stress triggers the growth of an axial fracture in the surrounding rock. Shortly after initiation, the stored energy in the wellbore drives rapid axial fracture growth in the near-wellbore stress regime and the fluid flow is dominated by viscous forces. As the fracture increases in height, its rate of growth slows and it begins to encounter the far-field stress regime, which may favor azimuthal fracture propagation. At some distance, the fracture will tend to curve towards its new ideal orientation, or simply open a new branch in the azimuthal direction. Finally, the fracture will enter a more regular stage of azimuthal growth that is controlled by the pumping rate, fluid viscosity and/or rock toughness.
The behavior of this type of hydraulic fracture is well understood at very early times, where it effectively is a half-penny shaped fracture propagating in the near-wellbore stress regime, and at very late times, where it is approximated by a PKN or penny shaped fracture propagating in the far-field stress regime [1, 2, 3]. However, at intermediate times, there is very little experimental or theoretical work available to describe its behavior.|","Document Type

During a previous solute transport study (TRUE Block Scale) at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory in Oskarshamn, Sweden, an extensive characterization of a 100m scale rock volume was undertaken with an emphasis on fracture and deformation zone geometry and connectivity. The construction of a new experimental tunnel (TASS) adjacent to the TRUE Block allowed the opportunity for the detailed characterization of one of the key hydraulic conductors, a brittle-ductile shear zone named Structure #20. Utilizing high-resolution HDR and UV digital images alongside hydraulic interference analysis, borehole core and image log analysis, tunnel wall mapping and mineralogical analysis of fracture fillings, this study focused on understanding the geometric, mineralogical, structural and hydraulic heterogeneity of Structure #20 at a scale (centimeter to decimeter) important to radionuclide transport understanding. The result was a greater understanding of the in-plane variability of an important class of structural features in rock types typical for proposed high-level spent nuclear fuel repositories in the Nordic countries.
1. THE ASPO HARD ROCK LABORATORY
The Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) is a key element in the research and design of geological spent nuclear fuel repositories in Sweden. Seated approximately 450 m beneath the island of Aspo off the eastern coast of Sweden near the city of Oskarshamn, construction of the Aspo HRL began in 1990 and ended in 1995, though the excavation of new experimental niches and tunnels continues [1]. The geology of Aspo HRL is dominated by granitoids of the Trans-Scandinavian Igneous Belt, but also includes fine-grained granite dikes and sheets, mafic inclusions and xenoliths [2]. The age (1.85 Ga), mineralogy and chemistry of the rocks at Aspo are similar to those at the candidate sites (Forsmark, Laxemar and Olkiluoto) for spent nuclear fuel repositories elsewhere in the Nordic countries.
Aspo is run by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB), an organization tasked with the disposal and safety of the legacy of Sweden’s nuclear power program. Aspo HRL is used for the development of systems and processes for safe long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel using the KBS-3 concept. |","Document Type

N., The University of Texas at Austin| Pereira, J.-M., Universite Paris-Est| Vandamme, M., Universite Paris-Est| Dangla, P., Universite Paris-Est| Vidal-Gilbert, S., Total S.A.","|Abstract
Unmineable coal seams constitute important domestic sources of natural gas in several countries. Although limited in size, coal seams have the advantage of being naturally fractured, which facilitates drainage upon depletion. Reservoir depletion changes the state of stresses in the reservoir. The change of stress is suggested by order-of-magnitude increases of permeability upon depletion and observation of significant fines production in some mature wells, this latter phenomenon known as ""coal failure"". Desorption-induced shrinkage of coal appears to cause changes of stress in the formation in addition to those of porepressure reduction during depletion. We summarize laboratory data replicating the stress path of coal seams far from the wellbore considering no change of horizontal strain and constant total vertical stress. Experimental results show that desorption-induced shrinkage promotes significant lateral stress relaxation sometimes leading to shear failure. Desorption amplifies the effect of pore pressure reduction and makes shear fracture reactivation more likely to happen than in non-sorbing rocks. This study shows the importance of considering depletion in coal seams as a chemo-geomechanical coupled process and the importance of rock failure in bulk reservoir permeability. 
1. INTRODUCTION
It has been long known that depletion of water- and hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs can change the state of stresses in the subsurface. Changes in stress can affect both the reservoir and surrounding formations [1-2]. Pore pressure reduction associated with depletion commonly causes an increase of effective stress in the reservoir rock such that the reservoir rock suffers a process of compaction. This change of stresses in the reservoir is usually anisotropic. Effective vertical stress is expected to increase more rapidly than horizontal vertical stress in horizontally extensive reservoirs. Such anisotropic changes in stress can cause shear failure in the reservoir rock. These changes are commonly measured as a reduction of total horizontal stress as documented in fields in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico [3-5]. Significant changes of effective stresses upon depletion are also expected in the vicinity of the wellbore and perforations. Localized failure in these areas coupled with high flow rates leads to production of fines, a phenomenon known as sand production [6-7].
Coal seams are naturally fractured gas reservoirs [8-9]. They are usually laterally extensive with modest net thickness. For example, the net thickness of the Fruitland Formation in San Juan Basin varies from less than 1 m to ~20m [10]. |","Document Type

Fluid flow in fractured rock is controlled by flow paths in a network of discrete pre-existing fractures. The same can be said for fracture networks induced by loading or unloading. In both cases, or in the combined case, the determination or evolving modification of an equivalent permeability tensor is necessary for up-scaling the equivalent continuum hydro-mechanical properties of a fractured rock. The evolution of fracture aperture during shearing and the associated dilation process control the permeability of single fractures and fracture networks. In order to understand this process, a number of rotated Discrete Fracture Networks is generated with different mean fracture orientations. Permeability tensors are calculated, from distinct element hydro-mechanically coupled models, when initial fracture apertures are correlated with fracture trace length in 2D models at different stress ratios. A non-linear behavior between normal stress-normal displacements of fractures is adopted so that both scale and stress-dependent normal stiffness of the fractures can be considered. The results show that overall permeability continued to decrease, with the increase of stress ratio, when zero dilation is assigned to the fractures. However, when the dilation mechanism of the fractures is modeled, equivalent permeability decreases with increasing stress magnitudes when stress ratio is not large enough to initiate shear dilation processes in a fracture. In this case, normal closure of the fractures is the dominating mechanism for decreasing the overall permeability of models. When stress ratios increased up to k=3 or higher, most of the fractures will experience shear dilation with increasing overall flow rates of models. Flow rate distribution at different stress ratios show that a small number of large fractures with large initial aperture values remains conductive in all stress conditions and control the permeability and flow pattern of the models significantly. With increasing stress ratios, it becomes more and more difficult to establish an equivalent permeability tensor, compared with the non-stressed model. For models with non-zero values of fracture dilation angle, the existence of permeability tensor is not affected by changing in the magnitude of dilation angle when small stress ratio is applied. However, when stress ratio increases up to k=3 or higher, the values of dilation angles lead to additional contributions from shear dilations of fractures which become the main reason for increasing of permeability, compared to the models with lower dilation angle. |","Document Type

Uncertainties in rock and soil engineering are connected with the cognitive boundaries and with the natural variability of the relevant variables. In particular, uncertainties are linked to geometrical and mechanical aspects and the model used for the problem schematization. While nothing can be done to remove the randomness of natural variables, except defining their variability boundaries with stochastic studies, the uncertainties due to the cognitive gaps could be filled by improving the quality of measuring instruments and numerical codes. The present paper considers uncertainties connected to the design of protection barriers against rockfall and contains a simple application of interval analysis to the problem, in order to quantify spacing influence on predicting rock block volume. A case study is also presented: block volume calculated from interval analysis is compared to results obtained from a non-contact survey and validated with in situ measurements. Also kinetic energy calculation is performed in order to show block volume influence on the design of a protection barrier.
1. INTRODUCTION 
The design of a geotechnical structure has inevitably to include the identification and the evaluation of a series of uncertainties due to the characteristics, the complexity and the non-homogeneous nature of the involved medium, either soil or rock. If the design concerns slope stability problems, the amount of uncertainties is further complicated. In fact, not only the time factor has to be considered as an additional variable, but also the spatial dimensions of the potentially involved areas. Therefore, for a better design in the rock engineering field, it is necessary to focus the attention on the involved uncertainties [1]. The nature of the uncertainties in rock engineering is extensively discussed in literature. In [2], for example, sources of errors in sampling are classified as:
• Sampling error; • Estimation (“statistical”) error; • Measurement error. |","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing is carried out to create a conductive fracture in tight reservoirs to provide an easier path for fluids to flow to the wellbore. The actual performance of fractured wells is often turned down due to the loss of fracture conductivity. The inertial effects such as Forchheimer drag and acceleration are believed to the major sources for this. This paper presents an analytical method to model the accelerating flow effect on the production performance of hydraulically fractured wells by modifying the fracture conductivity. The method is suitable to conveniently incorporate the accelerating flow effect in a production prediction model usually used for fracture treatment design and optimization. The method is then used to demonstrate that the accelerating effect is the only one source for the minimum of fracture conductivity, one of the major sources for the loss of fracture conductivity, and account for the source for discrepancy between the predicted and actual productivities.

In recent years, petroleum exploration and production from the Bakken Formation in Williston Basin have gained great momentum and pushed the oil production to over one million barrels per day. Estimation of original oil and gas in place and recoverable hydrocarbons of the Bakken Formation requires an accurate estimation of porosity. Unfortunately, uncertainty in porosity measurements in tight rocks such as Bakken could be as high as +/-1.0 porosity unit if a single method is applied. This is significant considering that most Bakken sample porosity is less than 8%. In this study, we measured the porosity of tight rocks utilizing four different methods: gas expansion method, radius-of-investigation method, pressure buildup method, and oscillating pulse method. In this way, porosity of over 200 Bakken core samples have been measured in this study. The uncertainty in the porosity measurement is reduced by applying proper experiment procedures and cross-checking by different approaches. The comparability of results from different methods increased. Experience and lessons learned from this study can be a good guideline to the accurate measurement of other tight rock porosity. Therefore, a more accurate evaluation of hydrocarbons in place is possible and the primary production design and enhanced oil recovery method selection can be more appropriate. Furthermore, difference among the results is useful for indicating the heterogeneity and/or microcracks of the rock, which are crucial in drilling and completing unconventional oil and gas wells.
1. INTRODUCTION
During the last decade, petroleum exploration and production from the Bakken Formation in Williston Basin have gained great momentum and pushed the oil production to over one million barrels per day. However, producing hydrocarbons from the Bakken Formation is challenging due to its low porosity and permeability. The high uncertainty in the estimation of original oil and gas in place and recoverable hydrocarbons of the Bakken Formation is reflected by the wide range estimated by many researchers. In addition, porosity is one of the key parameters in modeling fluids flow in reservoir matrices. Unfortunately, uncertainty in porosity measurements in tight rocks such as Bakken could be as high as +/- 1.0 porosity unit if a single method is applied. This is significant considering that most Bakken sample porosity is less than 8%.

Inherently anisotropic rocks are modeled with the use of two-dimensional Discrete Element Methods (DEM). In the simulated anisotropic rock sample, the rock matrix is modeled as an assembly of rigid particles and the existence of weak layers is directly represented by imposing individual smooth joint (SJ) contacts with same orientation into the rock matrix. The properties of a SJ contact include normal and shear stiffness, normal strength, cohesion, and friction angle. A systematic study is conducted to investigate the influence of these parameters on the macro behaviors of anisotropic rocks with different anisotropy angles under uniaxial compression condition. The Young’s modulus is found to increase significantly with the SJ normal stiffness when the anisotropy angle is low (0°-30°). The USC increases with the SJ normal strength at high anisotropy angle (<U+03B2>>60°) while cohesion raises the UCS at medium anisotropy angle (30°-60°). The influence of friction angle is not significant. Understanding the influence of each parameter is of great importance for the calibration of micro parameters to represent certain type of rock. A general process for the calibration of micro parameters to reproduce the strength and deformation behaviors of different types of anisotropic rocks is proposed. 
1. INTRODUCTION|Anisotropy is everywhere while isotropy is rare [1]. Many rocks are characterized by a structural inherent anisotropy which is due to the existence of rock fabric elements such as bedding, layering, foliation and lamination planes [2]. Such rocks are said to be inherently anisotropic as their physical, mechanical and hydraulic properties vary with direction. Rock anisotropy affects many rock related projects, e.g., borehole stability [3], propagation of hydraulic fracturing [2], and deviation of drilling. Therefore, a complete understanding of the behaviors of anisotropic rocks under different stress conditions is extremely important.|In the past several decades, many investigators have performed compression tests on various anisotropic rocks, e.g., Niandou et al. [4] on shale, Nasseri et al.[5] on schists, Tien et al. [6] on artificial materials. In general, the variation of failure strength with the anisotropy angle is characterized by a U-shaped curve with the minimum strength obtained when the anisotropy angle (<U+03B2>) is around 60°. In fact, the geometry of the curves as well as the failure modes with different anisotropy angles vary for different types of rocks [4]. Attempts have also been made aiming to investigate the effect of weak planes orientation on the behaviors of anisotropic rocks on the micro-scale through laboratory testing [7, 8]. However, it is very difficult to explore the micro-scale mechanisms from laboratory testing which leads to a lack of a thorough understanding of the underlying failure mechanisms. |","Document Type

Fracture process of inherently anisotropic rock discs under Brazilian test conditions are investigated with the use of two-dimensional Discrete Element Methods (DEM). In the DEM model, the rock matrix is represented as an assembly of rigid particles bonded at their contacts and the presence of intrinsic anisotropy is explicitly modeled by imposing individual smooth joint contacts into the bonded-particle model. A series of anisotropic models with different angles between weak layers and loading direction are tested (<U+03B8>=0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°). The anisotropic numerical model is firstly calibrated to match the variation of Brazilian tensile strength with anisotropy angles of anisotropic rocks from published experimental data [1]. Good agreement can be found between the failure patterns of numerical model and those observed in laboratory. After that, the fracture process of anisotropic rock under diametrical compression is investigated in detail by exploring the occurrence, development and coalescence of micro cracks with different anisotropy angles. Micromechanical studies are also conducted by examining the modes, increment and distribution of micro cracks at different stages in order to gain insights on the failure mechanisms of anisotropic rocks under indirect tensile test conditions with different anisotropy angles 
1. INTRODUCTION
Among the many mechanical parameters, the tensile strength of rock material is a key one because rocks are in nature much weaker in tension than in compression. Many rock mechanics applications like the propagation of hydraulic fractures, rate of rock blasting, and drilling of boreholes in sedimentary rocks are highly dependent on the tensile strength of surrounding rocks [2, 3]. The Brazilian tensile test [4] (diametrical compression of circular discs) has been widely adopted in laboratory to determine the tensile strength of rock materials. 
In laboratory, a series of experimental studies have been performed on different rocks with anisotropic properties in order to understand the responses of them under indirect tensile stress [5-8]. In fact, there is no consistent trend for the variation of Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) with the anisotropy angle due to the complex stress distribution between the weak layers and rock matrix. Based on results from nine types of rocks, Vervoort et al. [1] proposed four different trends for the BTS and failure patterns of anisotropic rocks under the Brazilain test conditions: trend1, the BTS stays constant over the entire anisotropy angles; trend 2, the BTS stays constant between 0° and 45°, followed by a linear decrease; trend 3, the BTS systematically decrease over the entire interval; trend 4: the BTS decreases from very low anisotropy angles (between 0° and 30°) and followed by a leveling off. They provided some explanations based on the relative lengths of fractures observed along the weak planes and in the matrix. However, the micromechanics for these different trends are still not fully understood. In addition, the failure patterns of anisotropic rocks are found more complex than those of isotropic rocks. |","Document Type

The interdependent effects of mechanical stresses and fluid-rock reactions govern the evolution of fracture permeability. Yet, the ability to predict whether the coupled chemical and mechanical processes will enhance or diminish the permeability of heterogeneous fractures remains elusive. In this paper, we present a modeling framework based on a previously developed model that calculates the combined effect of reactive-flow and geomechanical deformation on a heterogeneous fracture. We use synthetic aperture fields with varied micro-scale roughness and correlation length to investigate the effect of geometrical heterogeneities on the evolution of fracture apertures due to reactive flow. An Increase in fracture fluctuations amplitude enhances the development of channels in the fracture and can shift the dissolution regime from advection-dominated to reaction-dominated. Whereas an increase in correlation length reduces the number of channels while enhancing their widths. Anticipating such differences in permeability evolution is important in engineering application involving fluid-rock interactions, such as acid stimulation, for effective and efficient reservoir permeability enhancement. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Fractures often control transport properties in rock formations. Quantifying fracture permeability is crucial for the long-term isolation in geologic formations of (i) injected greenhouse gases (CO2) for climate change mitigation [1, 2], (ii) waste fluids for underground disposal [3], and (iii) nuclear waste for secure storage [4, 5]. The successful isolation of these fluids within rock formations requires robust predictions of fracture permeabilities, particularly in caprock formations relied upon to provide structural seals [6, 7]. Also, quantifying fracture permeability is important for the production of fluids through enhanced hydrocarbons extraction [6] and geothermal systems [8, 9] for energy purposes. 
The combined effects of fluid-rock reactions and mechanical stresses govern the evolution of permeability and porosity of reservoir and seal systems subjected to reactive fluids (e.g. [9-12]). Three processes govern the evolution of fracture porosity and permeability during reactive flow: (i) fluid flow through the fracture aperture for a given pressure drop or flow rate, (ii) concomitant evolution of the aperture and fluid composition due to chemical mass transfer across the fluid-rock interface, and (iii) aperture evolution due to mechanical stresses applied on the fracture surfaces. While normal compressive stresses deform the fracture and decrease its permeability, reactive fluid-flow can both increase and decrease fracture permeability by means of mineral dissolution and precipitation, respectively. Moreover, the combined effect of mechanical deformation and reactive flow on permeability can be dramatically different from the effect of mechanical deformation and reactive flow separately [13-15]. Tuning the flow rate or the reaction rate can result in the onset of reaction instabilities at certain length scales [16, 17]. Here we show how the onset of reaction instabilities is influenced by fracture heterogeneities characterized by the correlation length and fluctuation amplitude of the aperture. In the following sections, we present our model, use the model to confirm previously reported results on the effect of reactive flow and mechanical deformation on fracture aperture evolution, and investigate the influence of geometrical heterogeneities of the fracture aperture on the evolution of fracture permeability.|","Document Type

Dynamic loading methods promise new modes for stimulating geological resources. In contrast to traditional fracturing methods (e.g. hydraulic fracturing) the stresses in the source region may be significantly larger than the in situ stress which helps creating fractures not oriented with the maximum in situ stress. This paper discusses simulation of dynamic fracture initiation and propagation using Lawrence Livermore’s GEODYN-E and GEODYN-L codes. These are massively-parallel multi-material codes developed for shock wave propagation in heavily jointed rock masses. The codes have been validated by modeling various underground explosions. Here, we focus on various mechanisms of dynamic fracture generation in a rock formation with pre-existing joints/cracks. Various source geometries and energy release rates are considered to optimize the enhancement of the fracture network, which could be stimulated later using traditional methods..
1. INTRODUCTION
Large-scale deployment of long lateral wells supporting the initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures has led to a surge in production from unconventional resources in North America. However, one limitation of such fracturing operations is that the induced fractures tend to be aligned with the maximum in-situ stress direction, which is not necessarily the optimal direction required to create the most permeable fracture network. Here, we investigate possible advantages of emerging technologies using explosives to dynamically fracture deeply buried shale formations as well as provide flexibility and control to design more efficient fracture networks and enhance permeability in tight formations at depths of a few kilometers. In this approach we rely on the ability of stress waves from an explosive charge to overcome the in-situ stresses and create fractures in many directions, in contrast to one stress-aligned fracture formed during hydraulic fracturing. Additional approaches are presented to create enhanced fracture networks by using multiple explosive charges, varying their geometries, and optimizing their initiation times. The massively parallel codes, GEODYN-L and GEODYN-E used in the current studies have been validated for underground explosions in rocks [1].|","Document Type

A geomechanics study was conducted to examine the seismic risks associated with late stage mining at a case study mine in Canada. Recent large scale pillar extractions and increasing seismicity at the site identified the need to consider seismic risk as the mine extends deeper and sill pillars are thinned and removed. Due to a lack of available quantitative data, a 3D FDM model was developed and the rock mass strength and behaviour was qualitatively calibrated to various geotechnical data sources. With the installation of a mine-wide seismic array, as well as measures of ""depth of damage"" during drilling and observed damage recorded throughout the mine during several field visits, sufficient data was accumulated to qualitatively calibrate a plastic model of the mine. The challenges in implementing a mine-wide inelastic model calibration with data acquired late in mine life are discussed. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Numerical methods are utilized in geomechanical engineering to improve understanding of physical processes, to determine stress or strain at specific instances in space or time and to predict rock mass response to excavation, construction or support. Some of the key advantages of numerical methods in mine design include the timely prediction of rock mechanics processes for the duration of a mining project, experimentation with design and construction options (e.g. stand-off distances and sequencing strategies), and performance of sensitivity analyses. Numerical analyses also allow engineers to gain a qualitative understanding of the complex geomechanical system through quantitative evaluation. The largest challenges faced in numerical modelling of geomechanical problems originate from lack of complete knowledge of the true rock mass properties, fracture networks, stress conditions and groundwater influences for the entire region of interest (i.e. project site). Rock masses are discontinuous, anisotropic, inhomogeneous, and for inelastic mine-scale simulations; the determination of material properties or in situ stress conditions is typically difficult over the full extent of a region being modelled. |","Document Type

Assumed stress states can have significant implications to the feasibility of mining projects, as stope design, strategic sequencing and permanent infrastructure siting are major controls on development costs and production rates, and henceforth life of mine economics. The stress state used for numerical modelling purposes is typically a global assumption for the entire mining area of interest, when in fact the actual magnitude and orientation of the stress tensor may vary by localized geological controls. This paper provides a discussion on how to minimize uncertainty imn pre-mining stress state assumptions by utilizing analytical and numerical methods to back-calculate far field stresses from observations of borehole breakout. A case history is presented examining breakout observed in acoustic televiewer data in a deep shaft pilot hole at KGHM International’s Victoria Project in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. In addition to the use of conventional analytical methods, the available data are analyzed based on a series of two-dimensional numerical models. Ultimately, a stress model is developed to demonstrate the proposed analysis methodology. The proposed model shows the local variability in stress magnitudes across different lithologies while generally agreeing with a regional stress model from the literature 
1. INTRODUCTION
When designing excavations at depth, the stress model used in empirical, analytical, and numerical tools plays a significant role in the outcomes of analyses. In the field of mining geomechanics, the stress state can have significant implications for the feasibility of projects, as major controls on life of mine economics such as stope design, excavation sequencing, and permanent infrastructure siting are all dependent on predicted stress re-distribution patterns.|The most recent ISRM Suggested Method for rock stress estimation provides a strategy for stress model development which integrates geology and tectonic setting, stress indicators, stress measurements, and numerical modelling into a final model [1]. One of the preliminary stress estimation techniques recommended by Stephansson & Zang [1] is the analysis of borehole breakout data. Borehole breakout data provides a convenient way to estimate the in-situ stress tensor, as all the necessary information can be obtained simply by logging existing boreholes using a device such as an Acoustic Televiewer (ATV).|","Document Type

Measurement of the shear to normal compliance ratio is one of the few remote sensing techniques available for estimating the in situ properties of fractures. We present an accurate yet efficient method for predicting the normal and shear compliance of fractures using an asperity-based approach. The resultant capabilities provide an efficient, versatile tool for predicting the normal and shear compliance of fractures with arbitrary roughness under a given level of closure stress. We apply the method to the prediction of evolving shear compliance under closure stress. We also calculate the corresponding anisotropic conductivity of the deformed fractures and find that the direction of highest shear compliance correlates well with the direction of highest fracture conductivity. This suggests that the degree of shear compliance anisotropy may be an indicator of conductivity anisotropy in natural fractures over a range of stresses. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Seismic and acoustic measurements are the most readily available methods for inferring the mechanical properties of fractures and faults in the field. As a consequence, many authors have sought to develop approaches that can relate the geometric properties of a fracture to its seismic or acoustic signature. In particular, the ratio of shear compliance to the normal compliance has been pursued as an indicator of the microstructure within a fracture or as an indicator of fluid content [1]. Kachanov et al. [2] studied the similarities and difference between treating fractures as surfaces with discrete points of contact versus traction-free cracks. They found that although the resulting formulas for the fracture compliances have similar form, the microstructural parameters controlling the magnitude of the results were different. Sayers et al. [3] pointed out that such approximations obtain very different results because fundamentally distinct assumptions are made regarding the way the fracture surface interact. Sayers et al. [3] concluded that such discrepancies can be avoided if more realistic geometries and deformation models are utilized for the asperities or cemententation within the fracture. Sayers et al. [3] went on to demonstrate that 2-D finite element calculation can address asperity deformation directly and provide more reliable insight into the shear and normal compliance of fractures. In theory, more representative results could be inferred through the use of 3-D finite elements, however, it is currently impractical to use such an approach for large fractures or within extensive parameter studies |","Document Type

P., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; USASwiss Seismological Service| Cappa, F., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis","|Abstract
In this paper we summarize and compare numerical simulation results of injection-induced fault reactivation and seismicity associated with underground CO2 injection and hydraulic fracturing of shale-gas reservoirs. Overall, the analysis shows that while the CO2 geologic sequestration in deep sedimentary formations are capable of producing notable events (e.g. magnitude 3 or 4); the likelihood for such felt events is much smaller in the case of shale-gas fracturing. The reason is that CO2 geological sequestration involves injection and pressure disturbances at much larger scale and duration than in the case of shale-gas fracturing. In the case of shale-gas fracturing, the expected low permeability of faults intersecting gas-saturated shales is clearly a limiting factor for the possible rupture length and seismic magnitude. For a fault that is initially impermeable, the only possibility of larger fault slip events would be opening by hydraulic fracturing allowing pressure to permeate along the fault causing a reduction in the frictional strength over a sufficiently large fault surface patch and very brittle fault properties that would allow sudden (seismic) shear slip to develop over a sufficient large rupture area. In both CO2 sequestration and shale-gas fracturing, the brittleness of the rock is an important factor, which is a site-specific factor and it should be considered when assessing the likelihood of felt seismicity. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The potential for fault reactivation and induced seismicity are issues of concern related to both geologic CO2 sequestration and shale-gas fracturing [1-7]. It is well known that underground injection may cause induced seismicity depending on site-specific conditions, such as stress and rock properties and injection parameters. In the case of shale-gas fracturing, only three cases of felt seismicity have been documented out of hundreds of thousands of hydraulic fracturing stimulation stages performed to-date [5]. So far no sizeable seismic event that could be felt by humans on the ground surface has been documented associated with CO2 sequestration activities [2, 7]. However, at future industrial scale projects for CO2 sequestration, a much larger rates and volumes than current pilot scale projects would be required to mitigate the global emission of greenhouse gases. |","Document Type

The validation of numerical models of geomechanical processes relies on physical testing of these processes in a laboratory setting. However, due to their heterogeneous nature, test specimens of natural materials often show a wide range of geomechanical properties. In the last decade, major advances have been made in the quality and commercial availability of 3D printers. At present, 3D printing has been used in the fabrication of medical implants and prosthetics, prototyping of mechanical designs and even in the construction of complete buildings. This paper presents 3D printing as an opportunity to control many of the variables that are inherent to the study of geo-materials. By using a 3D sand printer to fabricate test specimens, we were able to produce multiple, exact replicas of specimens with a high level of control on the nature of the heterogeneities and the properties of the matrix. Preliminary test results are presented from uniaxial compression tests and optical microscopy evaluation of introduced flaws. By knowing and controlling inter-sample variability in terms of porosity, fracture networks, grain size distribution, density distribution, etcetera, 3D printing of geomaterials provides a valuable tool to validate numerical models, develop scaling laws and constitutive relationships, quantify the degree of influence from pore geometry, fracture network characteristics and structural heterogeneity on macroscopic properties such as bulk modulus and effective permeability 
1. INTRODUCTION
In the last several decades, numerical models of geomechanical processes have become a highly sophisticated and powerful tool to study the behavior of rock from a micro-scale to a basin-scale [1, 2]. These numerical models are heavily reliant on physical testing of natural rock samples for calibration and validation purposes. However, due to their heterogeneous nature, test specimens of natural materials often show a wide range of geomechanical properties [3]. This poses a significant obstacle for both calibration and validation of the numerical models. 
The rapid development of the additive manufacturing (3D printing) industry in recent years has resulted in the commercial availability of a wide range of 3D printer models [4, 5, 6, 7]. Although the vast majority of 3D printers produce plastic parts [4, 5, 6], there are 3D printing techniques that allow the printing of metals [7], ceramics [8] and sand [9]. |Although the possibilities of 3D printing have been recognized in the rock mechanics world [10, 11, 12], plastic has been the prevalent material of choice. To the authors’ knowledge, the ability to print granular materials such as sand has not yet been utilized in the rock mechanics scientific community. |","Document Type

Underground mines commonly use drill core rigs to anticipate future ground conditions. These drill core rigs can be highly expensive and can easily miss changes in rock characterization, depending on the amount of drilling taking place. In an attempt to provide a more efficient means of determining changes in rock characterization, a study was conducted using the Refraction Microtremor (ReMi) process in an underground mine. ReMi involves acquiring noise data along a linear array of geophones. Data is processed to obtain shear-wave velocities underneath the array. The data for our study was collected at an underground gold mine in Nevada, and was analyzed using the SeisOpt® ReMi™ (© Optim, 2015). The data was collected using horizontal and vertical geophones, placed into the ribs of the drift in a horizontal plane, rather than the industry standard placement of vertical geophones into the ground in a vertical plane. In order to determine whether the changes seen actually exist, shear wave velocities were measured in location of known rock characterization. These shear wave velocities were then compared with the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) and previously published correlations between RMR and shear wave velocity. This comparison yielded results that did not match the published correlation between RMR and shear wave velocity. It is likely that the stresses surrounding the excavation affected the shear wave velocity values recorded; however, it is difficult to quantify these affects due to minimal research regarding in-situ stresses in the area. In addition, the use of ReMi as a tool to determine the extent of voids underground was investigated. This can then be used to determine the extent of voids underground and help to distinguish locations where voids may be near above or below excavations. The recordings showed that a void existed, however, did not show the entire extents of the void. This is because the geophone array was not long enough to cover the full length of the void. In order to determine if the ReMi process can effectively be employed to detect voids into the rib, further research is suggested. |","Document Type

Enhancing formation permeability through hydraulic fracturing has become a common tool for oil and gas, as well as enhanced geothermal systems reservoir production. Nanodarcy permeability is common in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs requiring the production to greatly depend on the complex network of induced and natural fractures. Proppant is used in these complex fracture networks to keep conductive pathways open and connected to the wellbore for flowback after fracture closure. The quality and mechanical properties of proppant directly impact the conductivity of the fracture network. Numerous proppant and proppant pack characterization tests can be performed to understand the behavior of the proppant pack in a fracture, some of which were initially outlined in API RP-56/58/60 and later in ISO 13503-2. According to ISO 13503-2 section 11, proppant pack crush strength is determined based on the amount of fines generated at specific loading conditions. Although this method gives an idea of proppant pack failure in a stress range, numerous tests are required to deconvolve the actual pack strength but still do not provide any information regarding partial pack yielding and precise full pack crush strength providing only wide application strength limits for a group of proppants. To study this problem, numerous proppant crush tests were performed according to this standard with the inclusion of acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. Two AE piezoelectric transducers were placed on the crush cell to observe sound waves stemming from grain friction as well as particle fracture initiation. The observed AE rate throughout the test showed stress level at pack grain alignment as well as the initiation of particle fracture, or proppant pack yield. Testing was performed on 20/40 mesh white sand, manmade proppant, resin pre-coated proppant, as well as other saturated and unsaturated conditions, including surface-modification agent (SMA) coatings. Information gained from AE analysis was compared to post-test particle size distribution. As a simple, non-invasive technique, AE monitoring proved to be a valuable and effective tool in evaluating proppant pack yield and strength performance at downhole conditions, allowing the well operator to select the optimal proppant material used in the hydraulic fracturing treatments for his well.|","Proppant,  Acoustic Emission (AE),  Proppant Crush Test,  Proppant Strength"

Telegraph Hill has a colorful history extending back more than 150 years, and the geology and legacy of this promontory currently haunt the urban corridors that closely line its slopes. Telegraph Hill is underlain by resistant Franciscan Complex greywacke sandstone, largely unsheared, and grossly stable. The high quality rock in close proximity to the burgeoning shipping industry was a valuable commodity in the mid- to late-1800s, and the sandstone was mined extensively for seawalls, jetties, roads, and for ship ballast. The quarrying resulted in near-vertical rock faces up to 50m in height along the eastern slopes. The resistant sandstone exposed along many of the old quarried slopes remains standing to this day at near-vertical angles, with very slow retreat rates that resulted in builders gaining confidence in ‘snuggling’ close to these old slopes. The high, steep walls experienced blast fracturing and relaxation jointing from the removal of large volumes of the hillside, resulting in periodic, hazardous rockslides that serve as a persistent reminder of the quarrying legacy. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Telegraph hill received its name in the mid-1800s from the signal flags, or semaphore, located at the top of the hill that were raised by the lookout to inform residents of incoming ships [1]. Prior to the gold rush era, Telegraph Hill was a uniformly sloped, stable hillside, as illustrated in artist George H. Burgess rendering of the hill in 1849 (Fig. 1) [2]. However, this gently to moderately inclined, rolling hillside topography was dramatically and forever altered when the eastern slope experienced approximately 50 years of intense quarrying activity. The geology of this hillside, with resistant sandstone outcrops along the eastern slope, proved to be an invaluable and irresistible commodity for San Francisco’s gold rush and post-gold rush boom. The resistant and hard rock qualities that made this rock so valuable for a variety of construction related activities are also the qualities that have preserved these steep quarried faces, some virtually unchanged, for nearly 150 years. The resistant rock lured builders into placing structures dangerously close to the tops and toes of these slopes, leaving little margin for error. Telegraph Hill continues to experience hazardous rockslides and rockfalls along an approximate 1 km (0.7-mile) stretch of the southeastern, eastern and northeastern portions of the hill. |","Document Type

Surface deformation is commonly observed phenomenon in various geothermal fields and reflects subsurface volume change due to shrinkage or dilation. However, faulting and fault reactivation induced by fluid injection (seismic and aseismic faulting) can also be a significant source of surface deformation. Monitoring subsurface deformation is useful in understanding reservoir behavior such as fluid mass and energy transfer and the evolution of transport characteristics. Moreover, detection of slip may allow a more precise understanding of injection-induced seismicity. We assess surface deformations (vertical displacement, surface tilt and horizontal strain) as signatures in two different modalities: (i) isotropic volume change (Mogi model) and (ii) injection induced shear offset (Okada model) and compare the results with both the resolution of current geodetic tools and existing observations of surface deformation. Comparison of predicted deformations with instrumental resolutions confirms that geodetic signals, especially tilt and strain, are indeed sufficiently large to describe reservoir evolution in detail and comparison to field data suggests probability of significant contribution of slip on surface deformation. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Surface deformations of significant magnitude have been observed by both interferometric methods (InSAR) [1~9] and by direct measurement of surface tilt [10] in a number of geothermal fields. Subsurface deformations induced by cold water injection conform to two different modalities: (i) isotropic volume change and (ii) injection induced shear offset. Isotropic volume change can be induced by either thermal contraction (volume decrease) or pressure dilation (volume increase) in the reservoir with shear slip similarly resulting from changes in effective stress induced by changes in fluid pressures or temperature. 
Linking the observed deformation signal with a causative subsurface mechanism is useful in defining active processes in reservoir evolution. Such models may be used to constrain magnitudes of heat energy transfer from rock to fluid, fluid leakage and the evolution of transport characteristics of the reservoir. The detection of slip processes in turn constrains fluid flow and the evolution of major flow paths. Moreover, the detection of slip may allow the precursors to injection induced seismicity to be defined and monitored [11, 12] |","Document Type

Faults are geological entities with thicknesses several orders of magnitude smaller than the grid blocks typically used to discretize reservoir and/or over-under-burden geological formations. Introducing faults in a complex Reservoir and/or Geomechanical mesh therefore poses significant meshing difficulties. In our work, we introduce faults in the mesh without meshing them explicitly, by using the extended finite element method (X-FEM) in which the nodes whose support intersects the fault are enriched. For the Geomechanics the fault is treated as an internal displacement discontinuity which allows slipping to occur using a Mohr-Coulomb type criterion. For the Reservoir the fault is either an internal fluid flow conduit which allows fluid flow in the fault as well as to enter/leave the fault or a barrier to flow (sealing fault). In the X-FEM, the framework of partition of unity is used to enrich the nodes. The faults are represented by enriching the displacement approximation with a discontinuous (Heaviside) function. For internal fluid flow conduits, the approximation for the fluid pressure uses continuous functions that admit a discontinuity in their normal derivative across the fault. For sealing/impermeable faults a discontinuous (Heaviside) function is used to model pressure discontinuities across the fault. The procedure has been implemented in both 2D and 3D for both structured and unstructured meshes. Examples that demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of the procedure(s) are presented. Also, the influence of rate of loading on activation of faults is demonstrated. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Faults are geological fractures of rock in which there has been relative displacement in the plane of fracture. Fault slip reactivation may be triggered by changes in hydraulic pressures and deformations of the rock matrix which occur during injection and/or extraction of resident fluids as a result of disposal of waste water or CO2, or as a result of hydrocarbon extraction. Fault slips are known to induce seismicity (see e.g. [1]), and for potentially generating leaks in containment scenarios. The potential for fault reactivation associated with industrial activities is obviously an important problem not just from a safety point of view but also from a public acceptance perspective. |","Document Type

Usually the study of the strength and stability of pillars in cave mining is performed through empirical, analytical and numerical modeling methods. A comparative assessment of two empirical methods used to estimate the stability of hard rock pillars was conducted. Considering different pillar geometries, and specially an abutment stress model, the induced vertical stress in a rib pillar type were evaluated. To demonstrate the application and variability of the outcomes, the factors of safety was calculated taking as input variables the vertical stress over the pillars and the strength values obtained from the empirical methods mentioned. For the simple example of rock pillar stability analysis chosen, it has been demonstrated that a significant range in potential outcomes are possible, based on the natural variability (known and/or unknown) of the rock materials, pillar geometry and induced stress state. The empirical pillar design methods cannot be directly used for the design of pillars loaded in both compression and shear. The improve of rock mass characterization methods, in combination with probabilistic analysis and numerical modeling, may provide a means to incorporate natural variability in modeling parameters into the design of hard rock pillars in deep cave mining. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In cave mining projects, the pillars are the main support system for the production and undercut levels. The mining operations must be safe and with a minimum cost of reinforcement and/or repair, so the pillars must be and remain stable.
Empirical methods provide an attractive rock pillars design option for geotechnical engineers. These provide an effective means of analyzing the geometry, strength, and pillar stresses, as well as the properties of the rock mass. This paper makes a comparative assessment of two empirical methodologies available to design rock pillars, also the scenarios where these are applicable, and in addition the critical parameters required for a complete analysis are studied.
A comparative assessment of two largely empirical methodologies used to estimate the stability of hard rock pillars was carried out. Considering different pillar geometries, and specially an abutment stress model, the induced vertical stress in a rib pillar type were evaluated by Stacey and Paige [1], and Lunder and Pakalnis [2] methodologies. |","Document Type

Pierre shale is soft and difficult to frac. This is because of its high clay content. To increase the chances of a successful standard frac, we find that shale of this nature could be fractured by using a heat medium. Previous research has shown that a small increase in the temperature of frac fluid or water vapor creates a great number of micro fractures in shale, thus increasing the networks of interconnected gas and oil passageways in the shale mass [1,2,3]. Use of a heating medium to enhance the production of standard fracking requires documentation of Pierre shale thermodynamic properties. A set of experiments was designed to find the specific thermodynamic properties and associated strain properties of Pierre shale. Specimens of shale were prepared and coated with a film of random paint particles to allow us to perform digital image correlation and strain measurement. The results of data analysis showed that it is possible to create a model of frequency buildup behavior. The graph of strain data versus time shows how the heat waves pass through the shale with specific frequencies as it is exposed to the heat load. Additionally, we have calculated Poisson’s ratio and the resonance frequency of Pierre shale. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique first pioneered in the 1940s. It is used after the drilling is completed to create fractures in a formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production. This increases the paths in which hydrocarbons can flow and be produced. Usually, high volumes of fracturing fluids are pumped into the well at a high pressure. These fluids are usually composed of 99% sand and water, with the other 1% containing additives such as gellant, friction reducers, acid, corrosion inhibitor, clay control chemicals, iron control chemicals, scale inhibitors, and biocide [4]. These additives vary from formation to formation. |","Document Type

The potential and extent of erosion due to plunging jets of water from flows overtopping dams need to be evaluated for many dams. Hydraulic scouring is a phenomenon that may cause erosion of material downstream, potentially causing dam failure. Methods to assess the effects of erosion have received considerable attention in the past few decades. Many of the current methods have been developed based on empirical data, carrying a significant level of uncertainty. A numerical simulation based on the Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) is used in this study to allow a physically based assessment that takes into account the actual geologic conditions. Conventional DDA models are improved to allow the application of time-dependent and heightdependent loads from water overtopping the dam. An abutment slope just downstream of a dam is analyzed considering the joints in the rock mass. The results show that rock erosion is affected by the duration and intensity of the water jet hitting the rock. Moreover, rock stability is influenced by the strength of the joints. Failure phenomena are observed in some cases analyzed. The purpose of this paper is to present a DDA model that incorporates preliminary hydro-mechanical coupling effects and to present some preliminary results of analyses using this DDA model to assess dam abutment erosion.
1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, many dams have experienced significantly larger flood events than they were designed for, resulting in dam overtopping. When dam overtopping occurs, the hydraulic power of the impinging jet might cause foundation and downstream scouring/erosion, which potentially could lead to failures resulting in significant consequences. Significant scouring/erosion has been reported at several dam sites worldwide. As future flood events are expected to be more severe due to climate change, dam erodibility is becoming a significant risk concern.
Dam erodibility assessment typically consists of four steps: (1) selection of the extreme precipitation event to be considered, such as the probable maximum precipitation (PMP); (2) hydrologic rainfall-runoff analysis to estimate the extreme discharge rate, such as probable maximum flood (PMF), that a dam will experience under the extreme precipitation event; (3) hydraulic analysis to compute the impinging water jet load on rock foundation under the extreme flood event; and (4) geomechnical stability/erodibility analysis of the rock foundation subject to the hydraulic load. For step (4), the empirical Erodibility Index (EI) method [1] and the Comprehensive Scour Model (CSM) [2] are the most common approaches used for assessing the potential for dam overtopping scour and erosion. This paper presents an alternative way to complete step (4) using a geomechanical stability analysis. In this geomechanical analysis, the rock mass is modeled as a blocky system and its behavior is analyzed using the Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) [3-6].|","Document Type

F., BP American Inc| Patel, H., BP American Inc| Gil, I. R., BP American Inc| Hazzard, J., Itasca Consulting Group, Inc.| Damjanac, B., Itasca Consulting Group, Inc.","|Abstract
The contribution of natural fractures to well performance in hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in shale reservoirs is not fully understood. To better understand the influence of natural fractures on well performance, numerical discrete element modelling software was used to simulate the hydraulic fracturing process in shale. Two cases were analyzed: one with natural fractures and the other without natural fractures. For the first case, the modelling results show that critically stressed natural fractures undergo shear failure caused by the injected water from the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as tensile failures on the extreme limits of natural fracture planes. In the second case without natural fractures, there are only tensile failures associated with the hydraulic fracturing process. The microseismic energy of these shear and tensile failure events are simulated by the modelling software and recorded as a function of time or amount of injected fluid. Analyzing the results from both cases reveals a significant difference in the number and magnitude of microseismic events. A variation in the coefficient b of the Gutenberg-Richter’s empirical formula for the magnitude-frequency relation is observed with and without natural fractures. Similar variations in b value measurements are observed using downhole microseismic measurements from hydraulic fracturing in horizontal shale wells. For the downhole microseismic magnitude-frequency relations, it is recommended to use the coefficient b of the Gutenberg- Richter’s empirical formula to indicate the presence or the lack of natural fractures in shale reservoirs. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Downhole, buried array or surface microseimic measurements are used to infer the size of the stimulated rock volume during hydraulic fracturing in vertical and horizontal wells. It is, however, often difficult to establish a significant correlation between microseismic events (dots in the box) and well performance. To better understanding the hydraulic fracturing process in complex rocks various numerical models are being developed. One such approach — discrete element modeling (DEM) — simulates the hydraulic fracturing process in a rock matrix with or without natural fractures. An output of this modeling method is the microseismic energy associated with either the microcrack of the host material and/or microslip along natural fracture/joint surfaces. The modeling of this microseismic energy is complex and needs to be validated.|","Document Type

Subsurface pressure and temperature variations can alter rock properties both near and relatively far from the disturbance, causing detectable changes in seismic travel times. In modelling such phenomena, we employ large-scale geomechanical simulations to translate reservoir depletion values into rock deformations accounting for overburden heterogeneity and heavy faulting patterns derived from seismic interpretation. Subsequent velocity perturbations are then obtained using straindependent stiffness perturbations from nonlinear elasticity theory. By applying this methodology to a channelized turbidite reservoir located in offshore West Africa, we show that appropriate calibrations can generate geomechanically-derived overburden time-shift predictions that reproduce signatures from an actual 4D seismic monitor survey, providing valuable insights into reservoir pressures, rock compressibility and fault stiffness. The results also demonstrate the importance of integrating nonhomogeneous overburden descriptions in successfully explaining many 4D seismic signatures. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The advent of reservoir geomechanical models has enabled further levels of subsurface characterization by incorporating the complex interplays between finely characterized rock properties, detailed structural elements and changes in reservoir conditions. The models allow field management strategies to account for the operational risks associated with changes in reservoir pressures and temperatures, and therefore any potential impact this may have in a field’s drilling and production plan. These same pressure and temperature variations can alter rock properties both near and relatively far from the reservoir, causing detectable changes in seismic travel times.
Many authors have demonstrated the use of geomechanical simulations (driven by the pressure and temperature changes) to explain changes in travel times derived from time-lapse seismic surveys over compacting reservoirs (see Hatchell et al., 2003; Sayers, 2004; Hatchell and Bourne, 2005; Herwanger et al. 2007; Janssen et al., 2007; Kosco et al, 2010; Herwanger et al., 2013). Following these ideas, we employ largescale geomechanical simulations to translate reservoir depletion values into rock deformations accounting for overburden heterogeneity and heavy faulting patterns derived from seismic data.|","Document Type

We predict anisotropic velocity perturbations around a salt dome on the edge of the Sigsbee escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico, using a combination of 3D geomechanical modelling and the application of rock-physics predictions. The modelling predicts an increase in compressive stress in directions perpendicular to the salt face compared to a background model without salt. This stress increase causes an increase in P-wave velocity in the direction perpendicular to the salt wall. Similarly, parallel to the salt wall a decrease in compressive stress is predicted, compared to a salt-less background model. The stress decrease causes a decrease in P-wave velocity in directions parallel to the salt wall. A good match is observed between these predictions andobserved azimuthal seismic velocity variations from a multi-azimuth seismic survey. This firmly establishes a geomechanical cause for anisotropic velocity perturbations around salt. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The work of this paper contributes to the general topic of improving the seismic imaging of complex subsurface structures. Combining improved subsurface velocity models and more accurate migration algorithms, new wide-azimuth seismic acquisition schemes aim at improving our ability to image steeply dipping and overhanging salt-bodies, as well as sub-salt reflectors. In this context, these imaging applications have benefited greatly from the application of wide azimuthal raycoverage acquisition patterns and processing the data with anisotropic velocity models (Zdraveva et al., 2012). Nonetheless, given that anisotropic velocity models are parameterized with large number of variables (compared to the isotropic case), the task of attaining all parameters involved becomes much more complex. Given the inverse nature of the imaging process, the analysis of the seismic gathers may prove insufficient in some cases to efficiently reconstruct all parameters describing the subsurface velocity field.
This problem was addressed by the work of Sengupta, et al. (2008, 2009) and Bachrach, et al. (2008), where it was proposed to employ geomechanical modeling in deriving updates to subsurface velocity models in the vicinity of salt. This paper examines the application of these concepts to real field data, where apparent azimuthal anisotropy is observed surrounding a salt diapir. The aim is to provide a geomechanical basis aimed at explaining observed azimuthal velocity changes by numerically simulating the expected geomechanical conditions for subsurface sediments lying in the vicinity of salt bodies and the manner in which these would affect the velocity field. The eventual outcome of this technique should contribute to attaining improved velocity models that incorporate complex geological structures, and therefore, improve the quality of the seismic image. In this paper we show that geomechanically-derived orthorhombic velocity predictions are consistent with wide-azimuth anisotropic seismic data observations in the Gulf of Mexico. |","Document Type

We present a mechanism for shear wave generation from buried explosions as part of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Source Physics Experiment (SPE) series. SPE fielded various sized cylinder-shaped sensitized heavy ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (SHANFO) sources grouted into a borehole in the jointed Climax stock granite and detonated. A highfidelity site model was included in a numerical simulation that mimics the near field velocity environment measured by an array of in-ground accelerometers. This approach was accommodated through a coupled Euler-Lagrange (CEL) code that allows simultaneous solving of an Eulerian domain to model the high-deformation source region and a Lagrange domain that includes the complex geology with full contact. Specific laboratory-measured geomechanical properties for the rock and the joint sets were included in the model. The simulations compare favorably to the data and provide a possible physical mechanism for unexpected shear motion through the release of stored shear strain on the joints. This research will advance our understanding of explosion generated shear wave energy from low yield nuclear tests. This paper has been approved for unlimited release under LA-UR-15- 21405. 
1. INTRODUCTION
One of the most important phenomena that remains to be understood in the nuclear verification community is how buried explosions generate shear waves. Possible sources for horizontal shear energy generated by explosive sources have been postulated [1, 2], and widely accepted underground nuclear explosion source models currently exist [e.g., 3, 4]. These models are based on a spherical source that couples at some radius to the elastic earth. In more recent models shear is accommodated by invoking a damage mechanism [2, 5]. A shortcoming is that the exact phenomenological mechanism for a specific test site is not included in these models. The analysis of the near-field Source Physics Experiment (SPE) data described herein proposes a mechanism for shear waves in a jointed rock mass.|It has long been observed that near source effects from underground nuclear explosions generate shear waves [1, 2, 6] and that the magnitude and spectra of these shear waves can be used to help discriminate nuclear explosions from earthquakes [7, 8]. Recent experiments in granite have been conducted to investigate the near source dynamics of buried explosions – including detonation velocity, fracture, and spall – and attempt to account for shear content in the received waveforms [9, 10]. |","Document Type

Underground gold mines in Nevada are exploiting increasingly deeper ore bodies comprised of weak, to very weak rock masses. The Rock Mass Rating (RMR) classification system is widely used at underground gold mines in Nevada and is applicable in fair to good quality rock masses, but is difficult to apply and loses reliability in very weak rock mass to soil-like material. Because very weak rock masses are transition materials that border engineering rock mass and soil classification systems, soil classification may sometimes be easier and more appropriate to provide insight in material behavior and properties. The Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) is the most likely choice for the classification of very weak rock mass to soil-like material because of its accepted use in tunnel engineering projects and its ability to predict soil-like material behavior underground. A correlation between the RMR and USCS systems was developed by comparing underground geotechnical RMR mapping to laboratory testing of bulk samples from the same locations, thereby assigning a numeric RMR value to the USCS classification that can be used in spreadsheet calculations and geostatistical analyses. More broadly, this RMR/USCS correlation helps define the transition between engineering soil and rock mass classification systems, and may provide insight for geotechnical design in very weak rock masses. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Underground gold mines in Nevada are exploiting increasingly deeper zones composed of weak to very weak rock masses. Production zones within ore bodies are typically composed of intensely fractured and highly altered rock with Rock Mass Ratings (RMR) [1, 2] less than 45 [3, 4]. Access drifts and infrastructure often intersect faults and altered material of varying thickness and geotechnical quality ranging from blocky competent rock to soil-like material.
The RMR system [1, 2] is a numeric geotechnical classification system commonly used at underground gold mines in Nevada. RMR data is typically collected from drill core, underground mapping and surface mapping. Spreadsheet calcuations and geostatistical analyses are often perfomed on RMR data to construct predictive geotechnical models for a variety of uses including: a) mining method selection, b) stope design, c) ground support design, d) primary development and infrastructure planning, e) estimate development rates and costs, f) anticipate poor ground conditions, and g) quick reference to mine-wide geotechnical conditions. |","Document Type

In gas and oil as well as in several mining applications hydro-mechanical phenomena play an important role and need to be considered in numerical models for calibration and forecasting analyses. In this paper, a two-way coupled hydromechanical formulation is described and applied to real size, complex 3D mining and reservoir model examples including structures using the Finite-Element Method (FEM) framework. The proposed coupling considers increasing hydraulic conductivities due to the evolution of rock mass damage induced by mining activities or fluid injection. This enables the potential development of additional flow paths and affects the fluid pressure distribution, which, in turn, affects the mechanical response via the effective stress concept. The mechanical framework uses a strain-softening, dilatant and discontinuum constitutive model for both bulk rockmass and structures such as faults on a regional scale and discrete fracture networks (DFN).
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydro-mechanical phenomena for geotechnical extraction applications, as in the mining or gas and oil industries, are very important aspects of global or well stability, subsidence and in some cases, accurate forecasting of recovery. Most adverse rock related hydro-mechanical phenomena are stress path dependent. Uncoupled or loosely coupled modelling of flow or rock deformation is therefore not ideal; the important fluid rock coupling is over-simplified, or else, the stress path may not be replicated with high similitude.
Here, we present closely and fully coupled, parallel solution formulation adopting single and multi-phase, multi-component fluid flow formulations into a discontinuum, strain softening, and dilatant Finite Element model. Particular emphasis is on the nonlinear coupling of the deformable and strain softening solid skeleton and the fluid phase(s), e.g. the change of hydraulic properties with evolution of damage in the matrix material as well as the effect of pore pressures on the overall stress distribution. This governing system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is embedded in the framework of a Finite-Element (FE) algorithm and applied to various large-scale real-life mine and reservoir models. |","Document Type

This paper presents the result of a series of three-dimensional numerical studies that investigate the response of enhanced geothermal reservoirs to injection during the stimulation phase. In these studies, the three-dimensional discrete fracture network is explicitly represented in the model. The numerical analyses are hydro-mechanically coupled, and thermal effects during the stimulation phase are disregarded. The sensitivity studies evaluate how the following aspects of the injection method can improve the total shear-stimulated area: (a) staged injection compared to one stage injection; and (b) injection into cased borehole with multiple hydraulic fracture clusters vs. injection through open-hole completion. In addition, the effect of fracture size characteristics of the reservoir on the shear stimulation response is studied. It is observed that the technique used for injection of fluid has a significant effect on the total stimulated area in the reservoirs. 
1. INTRODUCTION
This paper presents part of a comprehensive study that investigates viability of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) using a numerical modeling approach. The purpose of these studies is to evaluate the sensitivity of EGS heat production to various in-situ and operational parameters and to come up with optimum conditions for heat production. Such numerical modelling analyses are valuable in providing insight into the complex mechanisms that are involved in EGS, considering that there is a high level of uncertainty associated with field data. 
In a series of previous studies, effects of various in-situ and operational parameters on shear stimulation [1, 2] and heat production were investigated in a two-dimensional framework [3, 4, 5]. These studies first investigated how shear-stimulated area (i.e., the total area of fractures that experience irreversible dilatational opening as a result of pressurization) is sensitive to different parameters, including density of the fracture network, fracture length characterization, orientation of fractures, injection rate and rate history, viscosity of injected fluid, and the positioning of injection and production wells. Subsequently, it was investigated how changes in the aforementioned variables can affect the heat production by evaluating histories of produced fluid temperature and power in typical EGS reservoirs for a five- to ten-year period. The two-dimensional studies allowed for performing numerical investigation with reasonable computational resources and led to valuable insight into the response of the reservoir to injection under different conditions. However, it is believed that the three-dimensional studies are essential to understanding certain aspects of reservoir behavior, including how fluid flows in a three-dimensional discrete fracture network (DFN) and how the length and geometry of the borehole segment through which fluid is injected relative to the reservoir size and DFN orientation can affect fluid flow.|","Document Type

The recent advances in hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas bearing rocks, aka ""fracking”, have been nothing less than astonishing. However, several aspects of shale fracking such as the topology, geometry, and evolution of the crack system remain not yet understood. In this contribution, based on the known shale permeability, on the known percentage of gas extraction from shale stratum, and on two key features of the measured gas outflow which are (1) the time to peak flux and (2) the halftime of flux decay, it is shown that the fracturing process is characterized by a very dense crack system, with crack spacing of only about 0.1 m. Then, a multi-physics approach to 3D modeling of fluid-driven propagation of a vast network of cracks and open joints in shale is presented. The complex nonlinear and anisotropic mechanical behavior of shale is captured by means of a microplane model. Because the crack spacing must be only about 10 cm, the fracture of shale is analyzed as a softening damage, in a smeared way, by the crack band model. 3D nonlinear equations governing the flow of compressible cracking fluid through the cracks whose opening and length is controlled by fracture mechanics are formulated. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In 2010 shale gas production accounted for 23% of the total US gas production and it is projected to reach 50% by 2035 even at the current extraction efficiency [1-3]. This represents a huge opportunity for technological innovation that, leading to increased extraction efficiency, can generate substantial economic, environmental, and societal benefits.
Although spectacular advances in hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, have taken place and many aspects are well understood by now, the topology, geometry, and evolution of the crack system remain an enigma. These aspects have to be clarified if the current rate gas recovery from the shale strata, which is only about 5%: to 15%:, is ever to be exceeded. 
In this contribution, a model to estimate the topology and evolution of the crack system emerging during the fracturing process is proposed. Based on the known shale permeability, on the known percentage of gas extraction from shale stratum, and on two key features of the measured gas outflow which are (1) the time to peak flux and (2) the halftime of flux decay, it is shown that the fracturing process is characterized by a very dense crack system, with crack spacing of only about 0.1 m. |","Document Type

Low quality rock is encountered in many manifestations in underground hard rock mines, ranging from weak and poorly consolidated rock to highly altered or foliated rock. Lateral mine developments driven in low quality rock pose on-going challenges to a mine operator, as ground stability issues, such as caving of under-supported ground, drift closure due to surface deformation or buckling processes, and degradation of exposed rock surfaces are a persistent concern.
For many operators, ground support design is an iterative process, as support practices are refined with time. This paper presents case examples of a rationales used to develop a support strategy for an isolated drift within squeezing Talc-Schist rock at depth. Field observations, numerical modelling simulation, and trials of a variety of support systems were used to assess conditions and to establish a path forward for long term stability.
1. INTRODUCTION
In ground support applications, the goal of rock reinforcement is to limit the amount of closure around the opening while assisting the surrounding rock to reach a new state of equilibrium. In some mining applications, this equilibrium is difficult to attain since the openings are constantly subjected to bending moments and stress redistribution.
The rockmass examples from this paper can be considered as ‘‘mobile ground’’ where the combination of high ground stresses and a weak rock mass lead to the onset of closure soon after the opening has been created.
Attempts at preventing lateral deformation from occurring, using overly stiff support elements, such as resin rebar, are ineffective as the ground continues to deform around the individual elements. Since some deformation is inevitable, managing rather than preventing deformation is the goal of the rockmass support. The rockmass is reinforced with support elements which are sufficiently stiff to provide some degree of lateral confinement, while still permitting some ground movement.|","Document Type

The pipe roofing method is one of the widely used excavation support techniques for conventional tunneling. It is to install steel (or fiber glass) pipes in a canopy shape around the area to be excavated and then to excavate the soils under the protection of the pipe roof. This paper presents the optimization of the pipe roof design for the Gongbei Port tunnel excavation which represents the largest single tunnel excavation in China. The preliminary design proposed to use a pipe roof consisting of steel pipes with two different diameters which brought serious construability issues. During the construction phase, the contractor optimized the design of the pipe roof by using pipes with a uniform diameter, while adjusting the pipe layouts and optimizing the jacking and receiving plan. The new pipe roof design significantly improves the constructability, as well as reduces the construction cost and shortens the construction duration. The Gongbei Port tunnel construction expands the conventional tunneling technique by using an unprecedented large pipe roofing system along a curved tunnel alignment, and the optimization of the pipe roof design provides valuable case history experience for future projects.
1. INTRODUCTION
The pipe roofing method is one of the widely used excavation support techniques for conventional tunneling. It is also referred as “Steel Pipe Umbrella” [1], “Steel Pipe Canopy” [2], “Umbrella Arch Method” [3], “Long-Span Steel Pipe Fore-piping” [4], or “Pipe Roof Umbrella” [5] in the literature. It is to install steel (or fiber glass) pipes in a canopy shape around the area to be excavated and then to excavate the soils under the protection of the pipe roof. The pipe roofing method was firstly used in Japan in 1982 and then widely used as an excavation support technique for shallowly buried underground excavations [6]. Recent decades have seen many successful case history projects using pipe roof as an excavation support worldwide. The case history experience showed that under the protection of the pipe roof, the disturbance from the excavation to the ground can be significantly reduced and the ground movement can typically be controlled within 2 cm while the deformation of the pipe roof is smaller than 0.5 cm [7].|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing has been utilized as a pre-conditioning method in block cave mining to improve cavability and fragmentation sizes in recent years. A successful hydraulic fracturing operation depends largely on the interaction between natural fractures and hydraulic fractures. This process has been extensively studied in the oil & gas industry where hydraulic fractures are commonly vertical planar types. In this case, the effects of natural fracture dip angle and vertical in-situ stress are neglected. However, in block cave mining, hydraulic fractures are generally horizontal radial types. The applicability of the existing conclusions for block cave mining needs to be examined. In this paper, the interaction between natural fractures and horizontal radial hydraulic fractures is investigated by theoretical analysis and numerical modeling. It indicates that both natural fracture dip angle and approach angle influence the interaction result, as well as all the three in-situ stresses. It shows that hydraulic fractures are more likely to cross natural fractures if rock tensile strength is sufficiently low, or the product of flow rate and fluid viscosity is sufficiently high. Rock masses in block cave mining have mixed-qualities. High flow rate and fluid viscosity are recommended in regions where hydraulic fractures are not able to cross natural fractures.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing was firstly experimentally used in 1947, and its first commercially successful application was realized in 1949 [1]. From then on, this technique has been widely utilized in the oil & gas industry for reservoir stimulation. In recent decades, hydraulic fracturing has been introduced into the mining industry. Initially, it was applied in coal mining for methane extraction since the 1970s in the United States and to control hard roof rockburst [2-5]. Then, it was used in cave mining for either caving inducement or preconditioning [6-9]. When hydraulic fracturing is utilized in cave mining, it is more economic compared with the traditional drilling and blasting, and has the ability to improve both cavability and fragmentation sizes [10].|","Document Type

In the US, for purpose of accessing remote reserve area, some coal mines have to maintain aged underground belt entries for a great distance. However, due to high humidity, warm temperature, and time effect, progressive roof deterioration and unexpected roof fall pose a great challenge to ground control engineers. With active belt structure in place and limited space, rebolting becomes very costly, less effective, and sometimes impractical and unfeasible. To gain long-term entry stability and serviceability, operators typically rehabilitate the aged belt entries installing standing steel set supports. In the last several years, Keystone Mining Services, LLC (KMS) has assisted many coal mines with their belt entry rehabilitation projects, evaluated ground condition of various aged belt entries, and designed different standing steel set support systems. This paper presents a case study of a large scale roof fall that occurred at an aged belt entry in a mine located in eastern coal field, analyzes root cause of excessive deformation of square sets that were installed in adjacent entry, evaluates adequacy of existing rehabilitation square set, and develops remedial recommendations for future rehabilitation practice. Based on the case study, the paper outlines a rehabilitation steel set design guideline that includes field evaluation, engineering considerations, design assumptions, steel structural analysis, and field installation quality control. 
1. INTRODUCTION
With gradual depletion of nearby coal reserves, some underground coal mines have to maintain long-term entries (belt, track, return airway, etc.) for a great distance in order to access remote coal reserve area. However, due to high humidity, warm temperature, and aging effect in the belt entry, roof strata weathering and pillar degradation become more and more severe. Progressive roof deterioration poses a great challenge to ground control engineers. Pillar rib sloughs at certain locations, entry width increases at some areas, immediate roof sags, immediate roof rock pops out between bolts, existing bolts lose functionality due to corrosion, cutters develop deeper in corners, and strata separation develops deeper up into the main roof. As a result, unexpected roof fall occurs in a random manner, which results in loss of production, damage of belt structure, and even injuries to underground personnel. |","Document Type

Over last 40 years, rockbursts have been responsible for thousands of accidents and fatalities in nearly 140 underground coal mines in China. Therefore, rockbursts have become one of the most significant safety concerns in Chinese coal industry. In recent years, governmental agencies, research institutes, and coal companies have exerted great efforts studying the rockburst phenomena. State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS) revised coal mine safety regulations, re-formulated relevant coal mine design standards, and put forward more stringent requirements in terms of hazard assessments, rockburst monitoring, regional precautions, local preventions, result evaluation, and safety protection. Professionals from research institutes and universities analyzed rockburst occurring mechanism, and agreed that the rockburst phenomena is an abrupt destruction of coal/rock mass after its strength capacity being exceeded by corresponding state of stress. Several rockburst prevention methods have been developed based on stress control theory, and were applied to Chinese coal mines. Regional stress control methods, such as optimized mine layout, sacrificial protective mining in selected seam, and so on, were utilized to mitigate potential rockburst conditions. In addition, local stress control methods, such as stress relief via deep borehole drilling, roof strata weakening via pre-mining fracturing or blasting, coal seam stress relief via controlled bursting, coal seam softening via water injection, floor strata blasting, hydro-fracturing, and so on, have been utilized to reduce high stress concentrations, which could otherwise induce catastrophic rockbursts. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Coal mining is essential to economy development in China. Per recent official statistics, about 2/3 primary energy production and consumption relied on coal in China. In 2013, total Chinese coal production exceeded 3,860 million tons, and it was projected that coal will remain as main energy source in China within next 50 years.
However, shallow coal reserves have almost been depleted after decades of mining. Currently, average mining depth of underground coal mines in China is about 600 m. Furthermore, 47 coal mines, such as Suncun Mine in Shandong province, Zhangji Mine in Jiangsu province, and No. 10 Mine of Pingdingshan Coal Mine Group in Henan province, currently extract coal reserves at a mining depth greater than 1,000 m. As a matter of fact, Suncun Mine has become the deepest coal mine in Asia, with a maximum depth of cover approximately 1,501 m. |","Document Type

W., Shell Exploration and Production Company| Ekbote, S., Shell International Exploration and Production Inc.| Hows, M. P., Shell International Exploration and Production Inc.| Wong, G. K., Shell Exploration and Production Company","|Abstract
Cap rock integrity is one of the key safety concerns for any fluid injection operations. The estimated minimum in situ stress in the cap rock is one of the inputs used to set the injection pressure limits. These stress magnitudes are typically derived from models that are calibrated to available direct or indirect field measurements. Traditionally, stress measurements are acquired as part of drilling operations to pressure test casing shoes. However, availability of high quality data in deep water environments is very limited because of various operational constraints and concerns over weakening and damaging of wells and the formation. To address these challenges, we shifted our data acquisition strategy focus from drilling to well abandonment operations. One of the key advantages of this acquisition strategy is the flexibility and variety of tests that can be performed. The frequency and location of tests can also be tailored to different operations throughout our assets. With this new strategy, we can acquire measurements throughout the full life-cycle of the field. This shift in focus also provides us unique opportunities to acquire high quality measurements directly in the zone of interest without risking the integrity of the well during drilling operations or the cap rocks. In this paper, we intend to highlight several examples to demonstrate how we have successfully integrated and utilized this new data acquisition strategy throughout our deep water portfolios.
1. INTRODUCTION
Produced water reinjection, waterflood, steam injection, cutting reinjection, CO2 injection and gas injection have become essential components for field developments around the world. Integrity of the cap rock is one of the biggest safety concerns for successful execution of these operations. Defining a robust injection operation guideline for waterflood or produced water reinjection that achieves maximum pressure/rate while preventing out-of-zone injection has become a critical geomechanics challenge. The reliance on full-scaled Mechanical Earth Models and other analytical or empirical fit-for-purpose models to address safety concerns in the deep-water environment has increased significantly over the last decades:|• Maximizing injector performance while ensuring cap rock integrity and containment by defining safe injection guidelines. • Enhancing our ability in safely delivering wells by making better estimates of drilling margins for well planning and design in challenging drilling environments. • More reliable input parameters for studying underground blowouts and worst case discharge scenarios. • Optimizing field development strategy through realistic forecasts on production- and/or injectioninduced deformation that can cause damages to well integrity and surface facilities.|","Document Type

This research uses 3-D numerical analyses to analyze selected roof support plans with primary and secondary support in and around four-way coal mine intersection geometry with one corner cut-off. Rock mass engineering parameters for analyses were developed using estimated values of GSI and Hoek-Brown parameters for different roof and floor lithologies. Numerical models also included recently developed normal and shear stiffness parameters for the interfaces located in the immediate roof strata. The data shows that the currently practiced roof support geometry may not be achieving appropriate reinforcement of the rock mass around intersection corners and may contribute to roof falls. Modeled support plans are considered operationally viable and cost effective. One support plan incorporates principal author’s concepts for improved roof support around intersections. Authors also develop here an alternate approach for assessing the rock mass reinforcement effect of roof support plans using numerical modeling data. It utilizes calculating area within critical tensile, compressive, and shear strain zones before and after roof support. 
1. BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
Supporting intersections in room-and-pillar and longwall mining layouts is a complex engineering problem. Active and/or passive roof bolting is the most common primary support at intersections coupled with as needed inclined bolts, trusses, and cable bolts as secondary support. Even though intersections account for about 20-25% of the area mined, 70% of the roof falls in the USA with fatal and non-fatal injuries (2002 to 2007) occurred at intersections [1]. A similar study for Illinois mines for the period 2004 to 2008 revealed that 80% of roof falls occurred at intersections [2].
A few years ago numerical analyses of an idealized 4-way intersection typical in the Interior Basin longwall coal mines developed a better understanding of stress and displacement distributions around a four-way intersection [3]. That was followed by similar analyses around physically realistic irregular intersection geometries in development and setup rooms [4]. Both studies ignored bedding plane interfaces but identified that the current roof bolting patterns may not provide adequate rock mass reinforcement around the intersection corners. Numerical modeling around an intersection can identify critical areas requiring additional reinforcement. Appropriate selection and installation of primary and secondary supports around these areas may help minimize failure initiation and propagation. There is also need to develop one or more quantitative parameters that can help compare two roof support plans over a designated area. This study attempts to fill these voids in current research. |","Document Type

Statistics were used and analysed in order to determine the overburden movement by using nine borehole extensometers and twenty-seven monitoring anchors. The numerical computer model was established to simulate movement of overburden in shallow coal seam with great panel width, through which the movement features of overlying strata were observed in different face advancing interval. It is proved that fracture zone and curve subsidence zone can be precisely distinguished and the separating deformation between two zones can clearly be seen. The overburden movement continued for three weeks and the mining influencing range of overburden varied from 330 metres to 420 metres. The separation between strata with different hardness has often been formed in the overburden movement. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Longwall mining method is a highly productive underground mining method in which a panel or a block of coal is completely extracted When a longwall panel of sufficient width and length is excavated [1, 2], the overburden roof strata are disturbed in order of severity from the immediate roof toward the surface, or even the aquifers [3, 4], which can lead to serious mine-flooding accidents and increased damages of the ecological environments [5, 6]. In order to describe the specific overburden strata movement, a numerical model was established to simulate the process of mining by using the FLAC3D. 
2. MINING CONDITION OF STUDY AREA
The longwall panel studied in this paper is located in the Appalachia Coalfield, United States. The longwall panels were Panels B5 and B6. (Fig. 1). The overburden depth varied from 600 ft to 900 ft.(180-270m). The average mining height was 7 ft(2m), Panel Length was 12,000 ft(3600m) for panel B5 and 5,700 ft(1430m) for panel B6. The panel width for both panels B5 and B6 was 1,433 ft(435m). The headgate and tailgate entry width was 16 ft (5m). The chain pillar system between Panels B5 and B6 was 200 ft(60m) wide. The average longwall face retreat rate was 30-50 ft/day(9-15m/day) during the longwall face mining under the study area.|","Document Type

W., Tiandi Science & Technology Co.,Ltd.| Wang, Y. G., Tiandi Science & Technology Co.,Ltd.","|Abstract
Strata behaviors in some extra thick coal seams with fully-mechanized mining are fierce. In some circumstances, some hydraulic supports were still crushed even though their working resistance had been sharply increased beforehand comparing normal supports in medium-thick coal seams. Based on field measurement, numerical simulation, laboratory simulation experiments and theoretical analysis, the movement regularities of roof strata in extra thick coal seams with fully-mechanized mining was studied in this article. The studies show that: if an extra thick coal seam is mined in one single time, the thicker the coal seam is, the bigger is the vertical and horizontal movement range of the surrounding rocks, and scope and peak value of the abutment pressure increases obviously. The concepts of “immediate roof” and “basic roof” in extra thick coal seams are different from those in medium-thickness coal seams. The rock strata above the extra thick coal seam would form a structure like “inverted-step cantilever group-articulated rock beams”. Such structure breaks periodically with the advancing of the working face, where roof weighting comes regularly in “small cycle - big cycle”. Different from high cut mining (3.5~7.2 m. mining height), physical and mechanical features of the top coal in top coal caving mining (<U+2265>7.2 m. height) play a key role in strata behavior. Under roof deformation pressure, the top coal was condensed to “a rigid coal structure”. Some roof strata deform the top coal while exerting no pressure on the hydraulic supports and they are called “strata without deforming pressure”. While the other part above such strata is called “strata with deforming pressure” since it exert deforming pressure to hydraulic supports via “rigid coal structure”. Based on the above knowledge, the lower limit of working resistance of hydraulic support in high cut mining and top coal caving for extra thick coal seams are proposed. |","Document Type

This model will be used as an input for analyses to evaluate the stability of the current and future open pit slopes. The rock mass modeling process can be divided into two phases: a database building phase which involves gap analysis and data collection, compilation and validation; and an analysis phase that involves data assessment and the definition of rock mass units (RMUs). This article briefly describes each of these phases and how they have been applied at the Toquepala Mine, with emphasis on the data assessment and definition of the different RMUs. |1. BACKGROUND  |Toquepala is a large open pit copper mine owned and operated by Southern Copper Corporation. It is located in Jorge Basadre Province in the south of Peru, about 160 km northeast of Tacna. The Toquepala Mine has been in operation since the late 1950s. In the 1980s, Call and Nicholas Inc. (CNI) developed an early slope design. Later, in 2000, updated slope design criteria were prepared by a joint collaboration of Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder), Itasca Consulting Group Inc. (Itasca) and Piteau Associates Engineering Ltd. (Piteau). As part of this later study, the rock mass characterization was updated. |The rock mass model developed for the 2000 slope design study was based on a series of mapping, drilling and laboratory testing campaigns. The laboratory testing program included a limited number of triaxial compressive strength tests. Following compilation of these data, rock mass units (RMUs) were defined based on lithology and the presence or absence of calcium sulfates (i.e., gypsum and anhydrite). |During the last 15 years, the Toquepala pit has grown. Pit slopes are currently on the order of 700 m high, and the next phase of mine development (Phase 5) will increase the slope height to approximately 950 m. Given this significant increase in slope height, and anticipated changes to the competency of the rock mass with increasing depth, it was considered prudent to update the rock mass model and slope design. |",""

Laboratory tests show that various splitting lines along the loading direction have been observed in Brazilian test. This is mainly due to the fact that the majority of rock materials are normally not homogeneous materials. In most laboratory tests, the main features of macro-fracture patterns within heterogeneous rock materials may vary from specimen to specimen owing to the differences of local heterogeneity. Thus, numerical simulation is conducted to study the heterogeneities of rock material under Brazilian tests in this paper. This is achieved through a well-developed distinct lattice spring model (DLSM). One of the main features of DLSM is that it can explicitly represent the microstructure of rock materials, which enable DLSM to model mechanical fracturing problems and to study the effects of heterogeneity on rock samples under Brazilian test. Numerical study demonstrates that, porosity and the distribution of pores and fractures contribute to the divergence of tensile strength and the final failure mode. Rock samples with lower porosities are featured with higher tensile strength and more brittle behaviors, and vice versa.
1. INTRODUCTION
Generally, rock materials show different mechanical behaviors under compressive and tensile conditions owing to their different strength parameters: elastic compressive modulus Ec and elastic tensile modulus Et. The elastic compressive modulus Ec can be easily obtained through conventional uniaxial compressive test, while the tensile strength of rock material is generally obtained through the indirect approach-Brazilian test [1]. Laboratory tests show that various splitting lines along the loading direction have been observed in Brazilian tests. This is mainly due to the fact that the majority of rock materials encountered in Civil and Mining Engineering are normally not homogeneous materials [2]. In most laboratory tests, the main features of macro-fracture patterns within heterogeneous rock materials may vary from specimen to specimen due to the differences of local heterogeneity [3]. Also, it is found that the same rock material with low porosities behave more brittle than those with high porosity, being regarded as hard rock [4]. However, these experimental work normally can only demonstrate the macro-scale behaviors of heterogeneous rock. Fundamentally, when a Brazilian disc is loaded predominantly in compression, large compressive stresses may concentrate on the contact area between sub-grains in microscopic view. Meanwhile, macro failure eventually occurs when some substantial tensile stresses are generated within the disc, and it is characterized by disc splitting along a plane/planes that parallel to the loading direction [5]. Obviously, these fundamental mechanisms of splitting failure of the Brazilian discs cannot be investigated well through macroscopic laboratory test.|","Document Type

Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture underground mine (TRJV) consists of disseminated gold in very weak and altered limestones, mudstones, and carbon rich clays. These sediments are typically highly faulted and sheared, and are often bordered by highly altered dacite dikes. A more recent challenge has been mines going deeper and needing bigger and better single excavation .i.e. shafts to ventilate and provide ore skipping options. The stability concerns and shaft sinking method will be studied to evaluate the ground support needed and address with risk analysis to avoid costly and impractical decision made in the past. 
The paper is an attempt to address the Geotechnical, hydrological, risk analysis to current technology and technical limits. Next five years several hundred millions dollars investment is expected for driving deeper shafts with innovative and sustainable technology to overcome current limitation. Also the author will address Engineering and support design criteria challenges to Northwest Nevada single excavation! Deep Shaft. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture (TRJV) is located in northern central Nevada, and is situated within the Basin and Range province, near the northeast end of the Osgood Mountains (see Figure 1). 
The TRJV mine consisted of two major segments; the Getchell Main Underground (GMU) mine and the Turquoise Ridge (TR) mine segment. The Getchell underground segment is currently shutdown. Newmont has a 25% stake in the joint venture with Barrick controlling the remaining 75%. The primary product is high grade (>0.3oz/ton) Carlin-style gold mineralization in combinations of altered mudstones, limestone, and calcareous sediments.
The Turquoise Ridge Mine is entirely an underground mine, and is accessed by two shafts used for ventilation, men and materials transportation, and ore hoisting. The TR mine utilizes the underhand cut-and-fill mining method due to the relatively low rock quality in the ore zones and the relatively shallow dipping 25-45 degree ore body geometries. The primary ground control uses bolting, mesh, and shotcrete. It includes the use of cemented rock fill and a quick mining sequence to minimize ground exposure time and unraveling ground.|","Document Type

Under high deviatoric stresses, rock salt shows shear failure, which is accompanied by microdamage. Microscopically, damage results from the accumulation of microcracks, leading to mechanical softening, increased permeability and a volume increase, known as dilatancy, which is a convenient damage indicator since it is directly accessible in the laboratory. On the other hand, it is well-known that rock salt can heal itself: Cracks can close due to viscous creep, and cohesion is restored by physicochemical processes on contact surfaces, such that over time, the damage induced by shear failure is completely healed in suitable stress conditions. This implies that softening, and the associated dilatancy, should decrease to zero. However, the understanding of healing processes is not yet as good as e.g. of creep, both experimentally and theoretically. 
The IfG has developed a phenomenological approach which treats healing as a viscous two-component process, comprising a crack closure and a resealing part, such that the former dominates for large values of dilatancy with open cracks, i.e. in the postfailure regime, while the latter becomes important at lower dilatancy, where new cohesion is developed on closed crack surfaces. The approach has been included in the constitutive models of the IfG, i.e. the advanced strain-hardening model of Gunther and Salzer, the elasto-visco-plastic model of Minkley and the discontinuous approach of Knauth et al. It is implemented numerically in the codes UDEC, 3DEC, FLAC and FLAC3D. 
In this paper we introduce the approach and implementation, and present a few simulations to validate the models. At the present stage, this should be considered a proof of principle, and further modelling and experimental efforts are certainly required.

Thermal-Hydrological-Mechanical (THM) processes during the 2014 stimulation at Newberry Volcano Enhanced Geothermal Demonstration Site were simulated using TOUGHREACT-ROCMECH [1], employing initial thermal-hydrological properties calibrated to previous injection tests [2,3]. Thermoporoelastic effects as well as simultaneous shearing on one, two or three planes was allowed, using Mohr-Coulomb criteria. The minimum regional stress is E-W [5]. Permeability changes on fracture dilation followed a cubic law. Initial reservoir porosities and permeabilities were 0.03, 5<U+00D7>10-18 m2E-W, and 10-17 m2N-S and vertical, with higher permeability in known fracture zones. Fracture dilation angle, cohesion, and initial fractions of fracture porosity and permeability were varied to reproduce observed flow rates. The best parameters were fracture porosity equal to 0.1% of initial porosity, 2 MPa cohesion before fracture re-activation, and 2° dilation angle. Negligible cohesion results in more shearing and flow at initial low pressures. A 3.3 % initial fracture porosity per bulk porosity resulted in negligible permeability enhancement and underestimated flow. A smaller dilation angle (0.6°) and lower fracture porosity proportion (0.0007), resulted in intermediate permeability enhancement and flow. Elements close to open well undergo simultaneous shearing on two shear surfaces, keeping two principal stresses equal, while their difference from the third principal stress lessens
1. INTRODUCTION|Injection of large volumes of fluid at high pressure allows changing effective stresses to levels where shearing occurs on pre-existent fractures, relieving differences between regional stress levels in different directions (principal stresses). Assuming that fractures are somewhat nonplanar, shearing results in some fracture opening, and an increase of fluid flow or fluid permeability. Such opening is expected to remain after pressure decreases at the end of injection, resulting in easier circulation of fluids and an increased permeability. When permeability is increased in large volumes of rock at elevated temperatures, this may allow sustained removal of heat and render geothermal exploitation economic. We model conditions considered likely at an Enhanced Geothermal System Demonstration site at Newberry Volcano in Oregon. As precise values of some parameters are unknown, we model a few possibilities, and note some differences of their behaviour|","Document Type

The construction of some civil and mining structures requires the installation of rock bolt to strengthen, consolidate and stabilize the rock-rock, rock-concrete or concrete-concrete interfaces. In this paper, an experimental study was put on to validate non-destructive methods aiming at detecting the state of corrosion in these rock bolts in real condition. The acoustic techniques were applied on rock bolts that were embedded in concrete blocks and submitted to accelerated corrosion using the impressed current corrosion method. In fact, ultrasonic pulse echo measurements were taken every 24 hours. In addition, an acoustic emission system was attached to the corroded blocks as well as a reference block, in order to monitor the corrosion activity during the corrosion process. Half-cell potential was also performed at the beginning and in the end of the corrosion process. For ultrasonic pulse echo measurements, a quantitative assessment of the energy of the echo from the walls and the end of rock bolts shows a decrease of the energy in the rock bolts when they suffer from corrosion. While the energy of the echoes stays unchanged in the absence of corrosion. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Corrosion of metallic materials in concrete and in rock is a major problem in the construction and repair industry. Visual inspection of metallic systems once installed does not provide proper indications of the current problem. Non-destructive methods are then very useful. 
Hadjigeorgiou et al. studied corrosion that affects the rock bolts in mining in Canada, and they recommended monitoring of the effectiveness of the rock bolts in order to evaluate their current state [1]. 
Baxter et al [2] observed that rock bolts will inevitably be affected by corrosion, and some explanations were provided: • Injecting the bolts with cement grout or resin is often not well-performed, as several voids could be observed. • Bolts injected with resin usually show more signs of corrosion. • Corrosion is higher near the bolt head, mainly due / to poor sealing with grout.

Volcanic activity often creates very complicated volcanic complexes due to interlayering of lava flows and volcanic ash. Song-Gok site, composed of volcanic rocks, collapsed at the lower part of the slope along several discontinuities around a fault. The result of kinematic analysis indicated the possibility of plane, wedge, and toppling failure in the failure section. The result of Distinct Element Method(DEM) showed that maximum displacement is 207mm and joint shear displacement is 114mm. A yield zone was verified at the fault plane of the failure section. Volcanic rock slopes have unfavorable geotechnical characteristics, which is caused by differential weathering, effect of groundwater based on permeability of rocks, and systematic joints generated by cooling and contraction of lava. When considering the stability of volcanic rock slopes, data such as geological features of the rock through detailed geological survey and variations of discontinuities and rock blocks should be utilized. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Most of Korea consists of mountainous topography, and thus artificial slopes have continuously been produced during the construction of infrastructures such as roads and railways. In particular, sections with a high road usage have recently increased due to the interest in new tourist attractions and changes to administrative and residential centers. Accordingly, construction on existing roads is in progress throughout the country. To secure the stability of slopes produced during construction work in advance, MLTM (2011) provides guidance through literature survey, topographic interpretation, geophysical exploration, geological ground survey, and various tests so that more stable slopes can be formed. However, for the new excavation or re-excavation of slopes, collapse frequently occurs during the excavation work. Even though the characteristics of rocks and the direction of major discontinuities are examined through geophysical exploration or boring investigation in the initial design process, slopes that are exposed during or after actual excavation could show unexpected unstable geologic structures, or partial weak zones could be formed due to the effects of the change in the weathering condition and the difference in the groundwater conditions and seepage over time. Therefore, for these slopes, the stability needs to be re-evaluated after examining the characteristics of weak zones in each section by performing a resurvey during construction and by making a detailed face map so that more stable slopes can be formed. |","Document Type

Estimation of pillar strength is a vital part of assessing the stability of pillars used in mines. In this paper, numerical modelling using strain softening constitutive law have been employed to estimate the strength of 32 stable St. Peter Sandstone pillar cases. The model results show a satisfactory agreement with the general Obert and Duvall empirical equation. A major limitation of using Obert and Duvall empirical equation was revealed and a methodology was proposed to address this shortcoming. In conclusion, an empirical pillar strength equation has been proposed to evaluate the stability of St. Peter Sandstone pillars. The findings are expected to improve mine planning and design of room and pillar mine in St. Peter Sandstone formation in Iowa.
1. INTRODUCTION
The St. Peter Sandstone formation has been a primary source of hydraulically fracture sand (frac sand) in the United States. Hydraulically fractured sand is used to keep cracks open so that natural gas can flow freely into wells in a process called hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing technology has made extraction of unconventional oil and gas resources feasible in the United States. Advances in the use of this technology has contributed to the United States, being the world’s largest producer of natural gas in recent years.
The surge of hydraulically fractured sand has led to increased production capacities of mining industries exploiting St. Peter Sandstone deposit. Currently, surface mining techniques are mostly used to extract this flat lying deposit. However, room and pillar underground mining technology has been employed under circumstances where the cost of removing the overburden cover becomes too expensive. In recent times, the use of room and pillar underground mining method is considered more sustainable over open pit surface mining method due to little environmental concerns.|","St. Peter Sandstone,  numerical modelling, pillar strength,  Obert and Duvall empirical equation"

The crack propagation process may cause connecting the main fractures and discontinuities to break away the rock slopes and produce large-scale failures in rock masses surrounding large surface mines. In this research, the pattern of cracks propagation and coalescence in jointed rock slopes under in situ stress conditions is modeled using a higher-order indirect boundary element method (known as displacement discontinuity method). The linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) principles are assumed for brittle rock mass, and a mixed mode fracture criterion known as the maximum tangential stress criterion is implemented in a higher order boundary element code (programmed in Mathematica).Prediction of the fracture mode, crack initiation angle, cracks trajectory and cracks coalescence within the rock bridge area of rock slopes can simultaneously be accomplished via this modeling technique. In the case of crack’s conjunctions and block creation, the results obtained can effectively be coupled with the discrete element method (DEM) (i.e. the universal distinct element code (UDEC)) to predict the blocks movements and shear displacements on newly connected discontinuities (high stress concentration points or plastic zones). 
1. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, application of rock mechanics and fracture mechanics principles in rock slope engineering problems is an interesting subject for researchers and rock slope engineers in order to improve the methods of stability analysis and safety factor determination. For instance, the safety factor for 25 sites of small rock slopes containing single isolated crack and edge crack under mixed mode I/II loading were computed using fracture mechanics fundamentals and limit equilibrium analysis. Their results were generally in good agreement with the field observations which may be reasonable for rock slope stability analysis [1]. In the similar case, stability of a small rock slope containing single cracks was analyzed based on the fracture mechanics approach and finite element method (FEM) under the effect of nonuniform stress distribution. Results from scrutiny of three slopes containing single cracks in mode I, mode II and mixed mode I/II of loading have indicated that the stable height of a slope may be estimated given the crack length in the slope [2]. Additionally, a complex procedure of arrayed discontinuities extension in a vertical slope was investigated using displacement discontinuity method (DDM) [3]. Cai et al. surveyed the tensile crack propagation in vertical slopes using FEM and strain energy density criterion. By so doing, the strain energy density factors were calculated in order to determine the critical heights of the slopes under the effects of tensile crack extension [4]. |","Document Type

This work reports a test of empirical equations for the relationship of mechanical specific energy (MSE) and rate of penetration (ROP) with key drilling parameters including both weight on bit (WOB) and rotation rate of the drill bit per minute (RPM). The test of the above empirical equations was performed using a new set of experimental data from drilling Carthage Mable with a TerraTek drilling simulator. The data covers the variation in the values of WOB, RPM, hydraulic power, type of oilbased drilling fluids, and type of drill bit. Combinations of WOB and RPM values are determined within the experimental range that yields the highest ROP while using the lowest MSE. While showing the potential benefit of drilling parameter optimization, the results are encouraging when compared to what was achieved in drilling experiments with operating parameters that were not optimized. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Industry is significantly interested in improved drilling efficiency and reducing cost. This is particularly true when the exploration for oil and gas moves to greater depths and harsher environments. With support from U.S. Department of Energy, TerraTek (now part of Schlumberger) conducted a research project to investigate the effect of drilling parameters on drilling efficiency [1~3]. The research was conducted with the use of a TerraTek deepwell drilling simulator and a Wellbore Simulator. Variables examined included drill bit types, drilling fluid types on selected drilling parameters, weight on bit (WOB), and rotation rate of the bit (RPM).
The drilling optimization study was continued at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) with focus on the effect of both WOB and RPM, since these two parameters are frequently adjusted while drilling. A set of empirical relationships was developed based on the experimental data from drilling Crab Orchard Sandstone [4,5]. A model appeared to indicate that such an optimized condition did exist, giving rise to a higher rate of penetration (ROP) with less use of mechanical specific energy (MSE) where MSE is the energy spent on removing a unit volume of rock mass while drilling. This work further tested the above mode for drilling Carthage Mable, which is another type of rock that is frequently encountered while drilling though hard formations. Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bit and oil based mud are used for the test as a representative of deep drilling conditions |","and Fluid,  Rate of Penetration,  Mechanical Specific Energy,  Weight on Bit,  Rock,  Drill Bit, Drilling Dynamics,  RPM"

A series of flume experiments was performed as a part of a comprehensive study of rock erosion in spillway channels. The flume provided a controlled environment in which different flow rates and block configurations could be examined. The results of the experiments suggest that there is a strong influence of block orientation with respect to flow direction on the block erodibility threshold. Similarly, increasing flow turbulence intensity and/or increasing block protrusion height were also found to significantly lower the block erodibility threshold 
1. INTRODUCTION
Scour of rock occurs as a result of hydraulically driven removal of individual blocks (i.e., plucking or quarrying). This is a critical issue in many engineering projects, particularly for dams, bridges, and tunnels, where excessive erosion can threaten the stability of the structure. The same phenomenon accounts for geomorphic evolution of channels in hard, jointed rocks. Numerous investigations from both engineering and geomorphology perspectives have examined the erosion of rock blocks subject to a variety of flow conditions including open-channels [1 – 5], hydraulic jumps [6, 7], knick-points [8], and plunging jets/plunge pools [9 – 18]. A common focus has been the evaluation of the role of discontinuities bounding the block in transmitting hydraulic pressures to the underside of the block promoting ejection from the surrounding rock mass.
A lesser emphasis has been placed on the influence of the discontinuity orientations on kinematic modes of block removal. In nearly all studies, simplified rectangular or cubic block geometries were used with vertical and horizontal discontinuities thus limiting failure modes to predominantly 1D lifting or 1D sliding. For more complex block geometries, as commonly encountered in nature, the 3D orientations of the block bounding discontinuities strongly influence block removability, kinematics and stability [19]. Accordingly numerous kinematic failure modes exist. These include pure translational modes (lifting, 1-plane sliding, 2-plane sliding), pure rotational modes (about a corner, about an edge) or some combination of translational and rotational modes (Figure 1). The orientation of the block with respect to the direction of loading (e.g., flow direction) will determine the applicable mode of failure. From a scour perspective, this indicates the threshold for block erodibility (i.e., the flow condition causing removal of the block) will vary with the direction of the hydraulic forces.|","Document Type

We present a set of experiments to investigate the development of solid volume fraction (<ed><U+00A0><U+00B5><ed><U+00BC><U+0099>) variations in the plane of a fracture in the direction perpendicular to the flow. We injected a concentrated suspension (<ed><U+00A0><U+00B5><ed><U+00BC><U+0099>=0.5) into the same parallel fracture in all the experiments, however, each experiment included one or two thin-plate obstructions at different locations and orientations within the fracture. Though the development of <ed><U+00A0><U+00B5><ed><U+00BC><U+0099>-gradients in the plane of the fracture was not observed in the experimental system, we did observed a surprising transient behavior of these concentrated suspensions. A pressure transient was observed at all flow rates in all experiments and suggests that the solid volume fraction distribution across the fracture as well as the distribution in the plane of the fracture affect the pressure response to a given flow rate. This pressure transient is related to the timescale associated with a solid distribution front reaching the fracture and can have major implications when designing experiments or interpreting pressure data from field operations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Flow of concentrated suspensions is important to a range of natural processes and engineered systems. Fluids from natural hazards (i.e. mud flows, avalanches, magma flows) are typically characterized by a large volume of suspended solids [1]. Industrial applications where suspended-solid flow is important include hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production [2, 3], and environmental remediation [4]. The rheology, and flow behavior, of the carrier fluid is significantly different than the rheology of the suspension, which is strongly influenced by the solid volume fraction (<ed><U+00A0><U+00B5><ed><U+00BC><U+0099>). At high shear rates, the presence of the solids typically causes shear-thinning behavior, whereas at low shear rates, a yield stress is common [5]. This is especially important in confined geometries, i.e. fractures, tubes, etc., where the walls can exert large shear stresses.|","Document Type

S., Memorial University of Newfoundland| Molgaard, J., Memorial University of Newfoundland| Butt, S. D., Memorial University of Newfoundland","|Abstract
Drillability or drilling efficiency of rock depends on three main parameter groups: rock characteristics, drill rig parameters and operational parameters. This paper describes the methodology of rock cuttings collection, preparation and their analysis for evaluation of the drilling efficiency and the performance of a passive Vibration Assisted Rotary Drilling (pVARD) tool in particular. The pVARD tool utilizes rock bit interactions to create axial vibrations in order to improve rock penetration. Analyses showed the correlation of such parameters as rate of penetration and weight on bit to cuttings size distribution. Several parameters such as mean particle size and coarseness index were used for numerical representation of cuttings size. Also a new particle size distribution bar diagram was proposed for cuttings samples comparison. 
1. INTRODUCTION
One of the purposes of an effective drilling fluid system is to convey the cuttings from around the bit to the surface [1].
Several studies have been carried out on drilling cuttings as these are commonly used for the geological description of wells. Also studies on the petrophysical properties of formations, such as porosity and permeability have been conducted [2,3]. These studies have outlined the importance of cuttings analysis. 
However, few studies have focused on studying cuttings as a mean of understanding the cutting action of the drilling tools. By analyzing the way that the cutter affects the different drilled formations and establishing relations between drilling parameters, drilling performance and cuttings, it is more feasible to make assumptions on the rock-bit interaction models for different drilling techniques.
Drilling performance is often defined as the drillability of a rock, that is, how fast a certain formation can be drilled. It is characterized by the rate of penetration (ROP). The parameters that define the drillability of a rock are usually separated in three groups: Rock characteristics (physical, mechanical, and micro-structural properties of the drilled formation), machine parameters (rotation, force, cuttings removal, etcetera.) and operating processes (drilling techniques, state of the equipment, etcetera.) [4].|","Document Type

In unconventional hydrocarbon resources, the estimation of the expected ultimate recovery for individual wells and the appropriate spacing for infill drilling near existing wells both have strong economic implications. A field test called microseismic depletion delineation has previously been proposed as a method to probe the reservoir directly to determine the extent of the depleted region near horizontal wells that have been produced for a significant period of time. In this work, we performed a numerical simulation of a microseismic depletion delineation field test in order to further understand the physical mechanisms that underpin the method. The modeling framework developed herein can be used to help design field tests and interpret field observations. We observed that application of a model that coupled fluid flow, fracture mechanics, poroelasticity, and geologic structure was able to produce the physical behavior necessary to interpret observations from microseismic depletion delineation field tests. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The successful exploitation of unconventional resources depends on the ability to develop strategic engineering designs using economic considerations as the primary drivers. In shale oil plays, like the Bakken for instance, suitable wellpad geometries and well trajectories are first determined and then repeated many times in an efficient pattern in order to reduce drilling costs. Similarly, hydraulic fracture treatments are commonly performed in repeatable patterns across many wells. This methodology is attractive from an economic standpoint, but given that heterogeneity exists in all reservoirs and that operational difficulties can arise, the approach may not always result in the optimal recovery for a given well. Evidence from field data has indicated that productivity of individual wells, and even individual completion stages, can be highly variable [1, 2]. It is useful to develop tests that can be applied in the field in order to assess the recovery efficiency of wells and individual completion stages within each well. This information can be helpful from a reservoir management perspective, for example, in order to estimate ultimate recovery or to determine appropriate spacing for infill drilling in a given asset. |","Document Type

The understating of rocks mechanical properties as a function of stress is required for many geomechanics applications. One is to estimate friction angle and cohesion values to describe the shear strength vs. normal stress over the normalload range. It is facilitated in the laboratory measurement using Single Stage Triaxial (SST) testing on multiple samples at different confining pressures. Occasionally, due to limited core availability a Multistage Triaxial test (MST) is conducted for the same objective. The uncertainty with obtained results using the two methodologies is not well quantified due the possible changes in elastic properties while loading and unloading the axial stress. Experimental results indicates the consistency of the obtained stress value at the Positive Point of Dilatancy (PPD) during MST increases the overall results and provides an adequate correlation between the two methods. This paper describes how the data should be interpreted to minimize the error with the results obtained from MST test results. Multiple rock types were evaluated representing different lithologies (Shale, Sandstone, and Chalk) to validate a possible single correction factor from MST to SST. Results appear to fit the five different rock types with and the model fits a wide range of well data from different formations, fields and basins.
1. INTRODUCTION|A single stage tri-axial test is commonly used to determine rock’s elastic properties such as Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and maximum compressive strength. It is typical to repeat the measurement on multiple samples at different confining pressures for Mohr-Coulomb envelope analysis to estimate friction angle and cohesion parameters. Measured parameters are used as an input to reservoir geo-mechanical models such as borehole stability or hydraulic fracturing. This requires a suite of four to five Single Stage Triaxial (SST) measurements to determine failure envelope criterion. Due to limited available core material on times at a specific core depth or inability to obtain multiple identical samples with similar mechanical properties, a Multi Stage Triaxial (MST) test can be considered as an alternative to the SST. This paper proposes a technique where the “twinning” problem may be mitigated by the use of the “multi-stage” tri-axial test. The laboratory measurement and developed technique for real time calculation as a feedback to unload during the MST testing is critical to minimize any sample mechanical property alteration and provides consistent stress value for the MC analysis.|","Document Type

A triaxial experimental program has been conducted to evaluate volumetric strains and permeability variations in very dense, reconstituted water wet/bitumen sand specimens for a pore pressure injection stress. The triaxial cell is housed in an environmental chamber to simulate in situ reservoir boundary conditions in terms of stress state, temperature, and pore pressure. A series of experiment were designed and executed for both isotropic or anisotropic stress states. This paper presents an improved technique and method to prepare a reliable and representative wet/oil sands specimen for reservoir geomechanical testing. The packing technique allows high quality, repeatable (porosity, relative density, and dry density), very dense sands specimen to be created. Eight synthetic water wet/oil sands core specimens have been prepared with different fluid saturations. The preliminary results from three experiments show that the permeability variations are very sensitive to stress state evolution along the pore pressure injection stress path. For initial isotropic stress states, only temporary improvement on permeability was found. However, for initial anisotropic stress states, permanent deformation following pore pressure injection resulted in substantial increases the effective permeability to water and the porosity in the dilated zone. 
1. INTRODUCTION
One enhanced SAGD (Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage) start-up scheme [1] has recently been proposed and deployed in a pilot SAGD well pad to shorten SAGD start-up operation time. This accelerated start-up scheme is related to pore pressure injection, which is expected to create a dilation zone vertically connecting two horizontal wells. This dilation zone is expected to increase porosity, permeability, and water mobility in the interwell region. There have been several publications on permeability variation associated with shear induced in unconsolidated sands through a series of triaxial tests [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9]. 
Most of these studies are conducted through triaxial tests with the following stress path: maintaining confining stress while increasing axial or vertical stress to induce shearing failure. In general, such tests are designed and intended to simulate the stress variation, such as triaxial compression and radial extension, during thermal recovery process. They may not fully represent the stress path and deformation that oil sands reservoirs undergo during fluid injection. Yale et al. [10] studied field oil sands samples with interbedded mudstone under fluid injection. The triaxial tests were carried out at room temperature under reservoir boundary condition with only modest levels of stress anisotropy (stress ratio 1.1).|","Document Type

At underground mines where cemented backfill is used for ground support, backfill strength properties are an important design consideration, particularly for underhand cut-and-fill mining operations where employees work directly beneath the placed fill. Following a backfill roof fall at a deep underground silver mine, standard tests were conducted to determine the strength and elastic properties of a typical paste backfill composed of cemented mill tailings. Unconfined compression tests and direct and indirect tensile tests were conducted with core samples obtained from paste fill slabs recovered from the roof fall. Test results indicated that the average tensile strengths determined by indirect methods (Brazilian and splitting tensile tests) were about twice the average tensile strength measured by direct tensile tests. To identify cold joints within the backfill, in situ direct tensile tests were also conducted on one of the larger backfill slabs using experimental test equipment. The results of these in situ tests were similar to the direct tensile tests and provided little evidence of additional cold joints within the slab. Elastic properties of the paste backfill were determined through compression tests with strain-gauged core samples. The results of this study are significant because they add to the sparse strength and elastic property data that are available for mine designs utilizing paste backfill. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Ground falls are typically the leading cause of fatalities in underground metal mines and a significant source of lost-time injuries [1]. As a result, a well-developed ground support plan needs to be consistently implemented to safely mine under these conditions. In deep underground metal mines, underhand cut-and-fill mining methods are used to mine narrow, steeply dipping veins of ore [2, 3]. In some of these mines, a paste backfill composed of cemented mill tailings is used to support the mined-out stopes or cuts. This cemented backfill forms a massive beam that provides a safe, stable back or roof for the miners who work beneath it on subsequently deeper cuts. The stability of this engineered beam is largely determined by two variables—its thickness and strength. Figure 1 shows computed factors of safety for twelve hypothetical backfill beams using four values of thickness and three values of strength [4]. As indicated by these curves, the thickness of the backfill beam is the primary immediate concern, but the backfill’s strength becomes more important as the thickness of the beam increases.|","Document Type

G., University of Louisiana at Lafayette| Boukadi, F., University of Louisiana at Lafayette","|Abstract
The first hydraulic fracturing was implemented in conventional reservoirs. However, this technology was not applied to Unconventional resources such as Shale reservoirs until recently. As a result of its application, along with the advances in design of the environmentally acceptable fracturing fluid, we are witnessing a remarkable increase in production of oil and gas in US. In this work, we show our experimental and theoretical work related to heating the frac fluid by a few degrees for increasing gas production even more.
To address the issue of the increased gas production from shale through shortening the post-frac shut-in time, we have studied and experimented with Pierre shale in detail. In our experimental work we suspended few grams of the shale samples in heated, deionized water and measured the changes in pH, Eh, (Redox potential), and Temperature. Using a video recording system, we simultaneously recorded the process of gas bubble flow under the microscope. We plotted our 210 data points. We used the Fourier Transform of the raw data to construct a Power Spectrum which we use to extract the hidden information from frequency domain. 
The results are: 1. it takes a short characteristic time for the heated water molecules to saturate and activate the shale capillaries. This part of the plot of Eh Vs Time shows that at the beginning of the experiment the capillary saturation and activation is controlled by hydraulic potential. The dominating frequency associated with this stage is the mean frequency of the whole power spectrum. At the end of the early process, a Diffusive transport of the cold or heated water into the shale mass begins. This section follows the Fick’s second law of diffusion. Diffusion process; using heated water instead of cold water, is much faster than that of cold water, and 2. The Eh show the release of the first gas bubble to be the result of hydraulic potential spearheading the rest of the process. After completion of the first stage of the process, the diffusion of the cold or heated water in the shale capillaries begins.This is where the addition of a small amount of heat energy to the frac water displaces the sorbed gas from the shale macro, meso, and micro pores. Interestingly, the gas production mechanism follows the predictable Activation Energy accurately, as described by Arrhenius equations especially when combined with Diffusion equation.
We conclude that (a) the diffusion time and the flux rate of water molecules into the shale capillaries can be shortened by heating the fracturing fluid. We may estimate the optimal post frac shut-in time and monitor the advance of frac water displacement into the walls of the main hydraulic fracture. Achieving higher gas production can be realized through faster Capillary Saturation/Activation by heated water and (b) the desorbed gas production follows a pulsing, swarm flow, and other gas flow types.|The practical application of the simple technology suggested in this paper is (1) we propose a cost effective methodology for determining the post frac optimal shut-in time which is much shorter than that of shut-in time when compared with cold water frac fluid, and (2) once this optimal shut-in time is implemented the industry may benefit from realizing quicker and higher gas production from their prospects. |","Document Type

Thanks to the improvement of surveying equipments, i.e. Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), dense point clouds and very precise 3D models of inaccessible rock cliffs can be obtained. Both commercial and self-developed data processing software packages allow the extraction of some parameters regarding discontinuity sets (i.e. orientation, intensity, Vb, etc.). Nevertheless, maps with the distribution of such parameters are still not common. A procedure for obtaining raster maps with the distribution of significant parameters for the geomechanical characterization of rock cliffs, open pit mine slopes and tunnel faces is presented in this paper.

1. INTRODUCTION
Thanks to the improvement of surveying equipment and data processing software, an increasing use of TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) for investigating and monitoring rock cliffs has been made during the last decade (Figure 1). |Both scanning speed and operational range have been significantly increased, reducing the surveying time and increasing the extension of the study areas.
More recently, professional UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) equipped with optical and thermal cameras (Figure 2) as well as laser scanners became available, making it possible to integrate co-registered TLS and UAV data into a unique 3D software environment, reducing shadow areas and providing very detailed 3D models of inaccessible rock cliffs with an accuracy of few centimeters.
By applying proper software packages, it’s now possible to extract not only the attitude of rock mass discontinuity surfaces directly from the point cloud, but also to map the distribution of significant parameters influencing the behavior of the rock mass, e.g. frequency, spacing, P21 (cumulative tracelength per unit area), Vb (elementary rock volume), etc. Moreover, the possibility of draping high-resolution digital images over either a point cloud or a 3D mesh derived from it enhances the resolution of the 3D model and the capability of extracting geometrical information from the surveyed surface.|","Document Type

Slick-water fracturing is the most routine form of well stimulation in shales; however N2, LPG and CO2 have all been used as “exotic” stimulants in various hydrocarbon reservoirs. We explore the use of these gases as stimulants on Green River shale to compare the form and behavior of fractures in shale driven by different gas compositions and states and indexed by breakdown pressure and the resulting morphology of the fracture networks. Fracturing is completed on cylindrical samples containing a single blind axial borehole under simple triaxial conditions with confining pressure ranging from 10~25MPa and axial stress ranging from 0-35MPa (<U+03C3>1> <U+03C3>2 = <U+03C3>3 ). Results show that: 1) under the same stress conditions, CO2 returns the highest breakdown pressure, followed by N2, and with H2O exhibiting the lowest breakdown pressure; 2) CO2 fracturing, compared to other fracturing fluids, creates nominally the most complex fracturing patterns as well as the coarsest fracture surface and with the greatest apparent local damage; 3) under conditions of constant injection rate, the CO2pressure build-up record exhibits condensation between &126;5-7MPa and transits from gas to liquid through a mixed-phase region rather than directly to liquid as for H2O and N2 which do not; 4) there is a positive correlation between minimum principal stress and breakdown pressure for failure both by transverse fracturing (<U+25A1>3axial ) and by longitudinal fracturing ((<U+25A1>3radial) for each fracturing fluid with CO2 having the highest correlation coefficient/slope and lowest for H2O. We explain these results in terms of a mechanistic understanding of breakdown, and through correlations with the specific properties of the stimulating fluids.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a mature completion technique which has been extensively applied in tight and unconventional gas reservoirs. For unconventional reservoirs such as shale with extremely low permeability, long horizontal laterals with multi-staged hydraulic fractures are necessary to deliver economic production. The introduction of hydraulic fractures significantly increases flow rate because of large surface contact area between fractures and the reservoir, enhanced permeability around the wellbore, and reduced fluid diffusion lengths (King, 2010; Vincent , 2010; Faraj & Brown, 2010). 
Water-based fluids have become the predominant type of fracturing fluid. Sometimes N2 or CO2 gas is combined with the fracturing fluids to form foam as the base fluid. Other additives can also be combined with N2 or CO2 to improve the efficiency, eg. coupling solids-free viscoelastic surfactants (VES) with a carbon dioxide (CO2)-emulsified system to further enhance cleanup in a depleted reservoir, extend the application to water-sensitive formations, and maintain reservoir gas saturation to prevent any potential water blockage (Hall, et al., 2005); or incorporating low-polymer-loading carboxymethyl guar polymer and a zirconium-based crosslinker to minimize the damage and maximize production (Gupta, et al., 2009). For unconventional reservoirs in arid areas the availability of water is sparse. In these cases, N2, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or CO2 may become an “exotic” option for stimulation fluid. For example, fracturing with CO2 has been used in places such as Wyoming where carbon dioxide supply and infrastructure are available (Bullis, 2013). |","Document Type

Two plastic optical fibers, both having diameter of 1mm, are used to read local disturbance or deformation at a point in granular material, such as sand, soil, or broken rocks. As light is sent into the 1st fiber and reaches its end, it leaves the fiber and hits surfaces of nearby particles. Part of the reflected light then gets into the 2nd fiber, which can be digitally recorded by using photo diode. Two fibers can also be aligned such that a gap is created between the fibers for sensing. The paper describes results of several laboratory and field experiments using these new fiber sensors. The examples include cases in which fiber sensors were used to interpret turbidity of muddy water, liquefaction, soil mass movement in a slope and so on. These results show that the proposed new sensors will be able to support data acquisition procedures in many different engineering projects. 
1. INTRODUCTION
A new method for monitoring complex behaviors of geo-materials using plastic optic fiber (POF) was proposed by Akutagawa et al [1]. Unlike in conventional methods of using optic fibers for engineering monitoring ([2], [3]), the new method uses tip of POF as monitoring points. A series of table-top experiments [4] have shown its capability, limits and potentials to obtain information on deformation of sand particles, passage of water in granular material, passage of air bubble, wetting process of dry sand and so on. Based on these experiences, a new sensor was developed where brightness and color nature of light returning from observation points can be processed by a CMOS-based sensor box. The paper describes the fundamental system of the new device in contrast to the original version in which only brightness of returning light was recorded. Several examples are then introduced to show new potential of the proposed method.|","Document Type

The objective of the paper is to investigate the initiation of the Jiweishan landslide by simulating the field geological conditions around and inside a selected critical rock block and then to study its stability through 3-D discontinuum stress analysis. The study led to the following main conclusions: (i) The mining excavations that occurred underneath the investigated block at the landslide site, the friction angle of T2 discontinuities and sliding plane, and the dip angle of the sliding plane seem to be the most important factors with respect to the instability of the investigated block. (ii) It seems that the friction angle of T2 discontinuities and sliding plane need to drop to a value between 5° and 10° for the investigated block to be unstable. This means that rainfall and karstification have played important roles in reducing the said friction angle and contributed to the failure of the investigated block. (iii) The northern part of the investigated block (key block) had moved out first from the top of the mountain in a direction parallel to the strike of the north boundary discontinuity plane (T2) and had undergone shear failure on the T2 surface as well as on a weak shale layer (the sliding plane) and the remaining part of the investigated block (driving block) had moved in a NNE direction and had undergone shear failure on the sliding plane and separation from southern and western boundary discontinuity planes (T0 and T1) to fill the empty space created by the key block to initiate the Jiweishan landslide 
1. INTRODUCTION
Figures 1a and 1b show the Jiweishan mountain, located in Wulong county, Chongqing City in southwest region of China, before and after the slide, respectively [1]. The Jiweishan mountain extends approximately NS. Its eastern flank is a 50-150 m cliff. The landslide occurred around 3:00 pm on June 5th, 2009. The source area of the rock slide was 720 m long, up to 125 m wide and involved approximately seven million cubic meters of rocks. Limestone blocks slid along a weak interlayer of bituminous and carbonaceous shale. The source mass collapsed from the upper part of the slope rapidly and crossed a 200 m wide and 50 m deep creek in front of it. The rock slide debris changed the course after impacting the opposite side of the creek, following the creek profile (Fig. 2), and traveled about 2.2 km within 3 minutes along the valley and finally formed a large accumulation zone with an average depth of 30 m. This is one of the most catastrophic rockslide events in China in recent years. It buried 12 houses and covered the entrance of an iron mine tunnel in which 27 miners were working at the time. This hazard caused 74 deaths and 8 injuries. Compared to other landslides, the Jiweishan landslide can be characterized by the following features: (i) higher traveling velocity, (ii) longer running distance, and (iii) more difficult forecasting [1, 2, 3].|","Document Type

A new formulation is given to conduct a probabilistic block theory analysis. A new computer code (PBTAC) is developed to perform both deterministic and probabilistic block theory analysis. The variability of the discontinuity orientation and shear strength is incorporated in the probabilistic block theory analysis. Discontinuity orientation is treated as a bivariate random variable including the correlation that exists between the dip angle and dip direction. PBTAC code was applied to perform both deterministic and probabilistic block theory analyses for a part of an open pit mine in USA. Needed geological and geotechnical data for the analyses were obtained from field and laboratory investigations. The variability of the discontinuity orientations resulted in important differences between the probabilistic and deterministic block theory analyses results. The results confirmed that the design value selected for the Maximum Safe Slope Angle (MSSA) for a particular region in the open pit mine based on the deterministic block theory analysis can be on the un-conservative side. In summary, the results showed clearly the superiority of probabilistic block theory analysis over the deterministic block theory analysis in obtaining additional important information with respect to designing rock slopes. The calculated values agree very well with the existing almost stable bench face angles reported by a major mining company which cooperated with this study. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The ultimate slopes of an open pit mine are generally excavated to the steepest possible angles because the economic consequences of the excavation angles are significant. For large scale open pits, changes in slope angle by approximately 2–3 degrees may correspond to a large amount of dollars in project value. However, steeper slope angles result in higher probabilities of slope failure. Therefore, it is critical to calculate the maximum safe slope angles (MSSA) and also to estimate probabilities of slope failure with respect to different cut slope dip angles.
The open pit mine slope stability is one of the geotechnical subjects dominated by variability and uncertainty because the slopes are composed of natural heterogeneous materials containing a large number of discontinuities. In discontinuous hard rock masses, the variability and uncertainty of rock slope stability analyses mainly arise from discontinuity geometry and discontinuity strength. Application of probabilistic analysis has provided an objective tool to quantify and model variability and uncertainty [1-2]. The first two types of probabilistic analyses to rock slope stability have been applied using either kinematic or limit equilibrium analysis [3-7]. |","Document Type

The purpose of this work is to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between damage, failure and the transport properties of cementitious materials. Many authors have looked for predictive models of porous media permeability. Usually, analyses are restricted to intrinsic permeability of the material and the evolution of the apparent permeability, with respect to the pressure gradient and to the nature of the fluid considered are left aside. This paper aims at presenting a new model capable to provide estimates of the apparent permeability directly from the pore size distribution (PSD) and from the properties of the fluid to be considered. The intrinsic permeability and the evolution of the apparent permeability with mean pressure are provided by combining Darcy’s law which represents the flow in the porous media at the macroscale and a combination of Poiseuille’s and Knudsen’s laws which represent respectively viscous flow and the diffusion flow at the microscale. In order to achieve a porous network in the material, which is consistent with a mercury intrusion technique, random generation of pores is implemented. The technique yields a hierarchical porous network, which mimics the porous space measured experimentally, without the need for entering neither the tortuosity nor the exact topological information about the pore shapes. Comparisons with experimental data acquired on mortar specimens show that the model is able to reproduce the intrinsic permeability and its evolution when the material is subjected to mechanical damage, provided the pore size distributions are available. For a given pore size distribution, the evolution of the apparent permeability is also provided and test data with several types of gases compare quite well with the model. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this work is to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between damage, failure and the transport properties of cementitious materials. This is typically of utmost importance in the long-term assessment of tightness of vessels and containment facilities.
Many authors have looked for predictive models of porous media permeability. Pioneering work by Kozeny [1] related the permeability to the porosity, the tortuosity and an average pore size and later on Katz & Thompson [2] predicted the permeability from the electrical conductivity of the porous material through a critical pores radius. There are also several studies in which the pore size distribution (PSD) was modeled, e.g. with a bimodal [3] or multimodal distribution [4], and then entered into some capillary bundle model. Recently, models for the calculation of the intrinsic permeability derived directly from the experimental PSD, without any idealization have been also discussed [5].|","Document Type

Many Nevada gold deposits are found in highly fractured, faulted, and argillised host rock with Rock Mass Rating (RMR76) mostly ranging from 10 to 50 classified as weak to very weak rock under Bieniawski’s (1976) rock mass classification system. Numerical modeling techniques provide a potentially useful means for evaluation of models for a number of different geological conditions, stress conditions, and support scenarios. The study focuses on application of numerical models for varying geological conditions and support scenarios for underground gold mines in Nevada. Time dependent numerical models are developed in 3DEC and calibrated to the displacement data procured by Multi-Point Borehole Extensometer (MPBX) arrays. Joints are embedded in the Numerical models by creation of a discrete fracture network. Parametric analysis of modeling parameters is proposed to determine confidence in these parameters at various underground locations. In the numerical models, the roof is supported by rock bolts to replicate the insitu squeezing behavior of the rock mass under stress. [2].
1. INTRODUCTION
Commonly, gold deposits in Nevada are found in highly fractured and faulted ground. Ground containing a large number of faults and fractures tends to be more susceptible to squeezing and moving. As ground squeezes and moves, safety begins to become a concern. In order to monitor this squeezing and movement of ground, Multi Point Borehole Extensometer (MPBX) arrays are commonly placed in areas of particular concern.
Multi Point Borehole Extensometers are composed of six anchor points and an integrated electronic readout head. The relative displacement between these anchor points is measured and recorded to determine displacements within the drift. These displacements can then be used to model typical behavior of the drift at the MPBX location. |The Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) approach is commonly used for joint generation in numerical models to simulate the behavior of fractured rock in an underground mine. The Discrete Fracture Network approach is well established and used primarily in petroleum engineering for permeability and fluid flow analyses. Methods by Snow (1965, 1969) determined the orientation and apertures of fractures in the field. Snow’s theory assumed fractures to be infinite, which would result in higher permeability values than the actual permeability of the fractured rock mass [1, 2]. Parsons (1966) used a regular fracture-matrix model with any number of fracture sets for the heterogeneous fracture system [3].|","Document Type

Simple models to describe time-dependent behavior of geomaterials in 1D and 3D stress conditions are presented. After explaining previous viscoplastic models and the problems these models contain, a new time-dependent model is presented which is formulated not using usual viscoplastic theories but utilizing the subloading surface concept by Hashiguchi [1]. Based on experimental results, it has been shown that the normal consolidation line (NCL) and the critical state line (CSL) on the e — ln<U+03C3> plane can shift vertically depending on the strain rate. The model can describe time-dependent behaviors of both normally consolidated unstructured as well as structured soils in the same manner. To describe the behavior of structured soil, a state variable, <U+01F7>, which represents the influence of density, and another state variable, <U+03C6>, which represents the bonding effect, are introduced. After the formulation is explained in one-dimension to highlight the fundamental concepts of the model, it is extended to three-dimensions using the tij concept [2].
1. INTRODUCTION
Most existing viscoplastic models have been formulated based on the over-stress theory or the non-stationary flow surface theory. The over-stress type models are formulated based on the over-stress viscoplastic theory by Perzyna [3] (e.g., Adachi and Oka [4]), in which the strain rate effects are described by assuming a Bingham plastic and utilizing the difference in sizes of the static yield surface related to the current plastic strains and the dynamic yield surface related to the current real stresses. However, this type of model is problematic in that the plastic strain rate is related to time alone. Therefore, it is impossible to distinguish whether the stress path is in the loading region or unloading region, because of a lack of loading information. On the other hand, in the nonstationary flow surface models (e.g., Sekiguchi [5]), the flow surface is a function of time, stress and plastic strain, and a flow rule is assumed on this flow surface, in the same way as elastoplastic models. This type of model is also problematic in that the flow surface contains the arbitrary time variable, t, which is not objective.|In the present study, a unified 1D formulation of timedependent behavior for normally consolidated unstructured soil to structured soil is presented. To describe the behavior of structured soil, a state variable <U+01F7> which represents the influence of density and another state variable <U+03C6> which represents the bonding effect are introduced.|","Document Type

The simulation of dynamically created fractures in porous solids is a complex problem with important practical applications in areas such as hydraulic fracturing and enhanced geothermal systems. Peridynamics is a relatively recent formulation of solid mechanics which has attractive features in simulating fractures, both theoretical and in numerical implementation. The method is gridless, making the evolution of three-dimensional cracks in arbitrary topologies straightforward. To date it has been successful in simulating dynamic impact and fragmentation problems as well as in the delamination of composite materials, but its application to hydraulic fracture has not been reported. In this paper we report progress toward this goal, by elucidating a simple coupled formulation between fluid flow and fracture which may serve as a starting point for more advancedmodeling. Particular attention is paid to the communication of pressure forces on the newly formed faces of the crack.
1. INTRODUCTION
Peridynamics is a theory of continuum mechanics which has shown to be successful in applications of dynamic impact and fragmentation, as well as in delamination of composite materials [1, 2]. A basic idea of the theory is to consider pairwise interactions of material points interacting with one another over a small radius, called the horizon. The interactions can occur over several depths of neighbor particles, so the theory is termed non-local. There are no spatial gradients required in the theory, so in a fracture process the numerical behavior is stable. A drawback of original bond-based theory is that one is restricted to consider materials with a Poisson ratio of <U+00BC> in three dimensions, and overall the constitutive behavior is limited (e.g. not able to capture plastic flow incompressibility). Even with these issues, the basic bond-based theory of peridynamics clearly has attractive properties in application to fracture simulations (e.g. more accurate crack patterns compared to other methods [2]). Recently, it has been applied to geomechanics problems [3], and its momentum will surely increase. Even aside from considering fractures, we find it also has well behaved numerical properties, and does not generally require special stabilization approaches like some other gridless methods, such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Therefore, a desire tomodel dynamic crack growth in applications such as hydraulic fracturing makes peridynamics a strong candidate to consider.|","Document Type

Monowire block cutting machines can be used for natural stone block squaring operations and slab cutting operations from natural stone blocks. The plants where the cutting operations are performed demand high product quality with minimum operational costs. The purpose of this study is to develop cuttability chart for Burdur Dark Beige limestone sample based on unit wear and unit energy in monowire cutting system and also perform cutting optimization. For this purpose, the full automatically servo controlled monowire cutting system which can cut blocks in three dimensions were developed in Hacettepe University Mining Engineering Department. Cutting experiments were performed at different wire rotation speed (peripheral speed) and wire downward movement speed (cutting speed) on the limestone block which is transported to the laboratory. A cuttability abacus in monowire cutting system taking into consideration the unit energy consumption during cutting operation and unit wear on diamond beads was developed with Design Expert 7.1 software for Burdur Dark Beige limestone sample by using the results obtained.
1. INTRODUCTION
Diamond wire cutting machines are indispensible machines used in several stages ranging from marble block production in natural stone quarries to the final product in processing plants. Today these machines are widely used in natural stone quarries and have evolved continuously in line with the consumers’ demands so far and have opened a new era in natural stone mining [1, 2]. Generally, the diamond wire cutting method is used in natural stone quarries and decorative cutting tests, cutting and lifting basic construction structures, railway bridges, old concrete chimneys and dams [3].
The process of reducing large or irregularly shaped blocks produced in natural stone quarries to commercial size or arranging randomly sized blocks into cube or rectangular parallelepiped shapes is called ‘block sizing’ or ‘squaring’. Various machines are used in the squaring process on blocks taken from quarries where marble and limestone production is performed [4]. One such machine is the mono-wire block cutting machine, which is important for sizing natural stone blocks and of slabsawing from the blocks.|","Document Type

Comprehensive stress analyses indicate that plastic yield, fracture initiation near or between packers or from a perforated hole are all possible during hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore a fracture can be created from one of the perforated holes located in deviated wellbore subject to three in-situ stresses regime. The corresponding fracturing pressure can be determined based on the orientation of this perforated hole. While a plastic yielding process on a wellbore or perforated hole surfaces may prevent a fracture from initiating, a fracture or fractures may initiate from a near packer region or at an oriented perforation when different completion strategies utilized. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Staged fracturing strategy has been widely used in U.S. and Canada for low-permeability tight formations. Fractures or a fracture network may be initiated from an open hole or perforations. Depending on the layout of a horizontal well, the perforation orientations, clusters of perforations, and their distances to the packers in each stage, creations of fracture networks and fractures initiation are of great interests to engineers for productivity and surface control purposes. We normally calculate the tangential stresses near a wellbore or perforation for open and cased holes, respectively. Whether a transverse, radial, or arbitrarily angled fracture can be generated, if a fracture can be initiated at a specific wellbore location or from one of the perforations (in the middle, at the edge of the packers or from one of multiple perforated holes) remains unanswered. These issues must be addressed by considering the critical stresses at the wellbore and perforations once we shall have a clear pictures if plastic yield occurs prior fracturing, or which perforation is oriented at an optimum position referring to the in-situ stresses, and if the near packer regions are heavily influenced by the in-situ stresses. Both a 3D finite element model and an analytical poro-elastoplastic model are developed to analyze the corresponding effective stresses. These models focus on regions near the packer or the oriented perforations. They evaluate the plastic yielding and the stresses in these areas in order to determine the location and the pressure at which a fracture can be initiated or no tensile fracturing is possible at all due to plasticity.|","Document Type

Mineral precipitation significantly alters the transport properties of fractured rock. Chemical solubility gradients that favor precipitation induce mineral growth, which decreases the local aperture and alters macro-scale flow and transport properties. We present experimental results that quantify the influence of aperture variability on the evolution of mineral growth patterns in a transparent, analog fracture. A continuous flow ISCO pump injected a supersaturated calcite solution, <U+03A9> = 31.6, into our analog fractures at 0.5 ml/min. Light transmission techniques quantified the evolution of local transmissivity and transport. Preliminary results from these experiments demonstrate that minerals preferentially precipitate in small aperture regions. This enhanced reduction of low transmissivity regions in turn catalyzes the organization of preferential flow paths, which persist despite continued mineral precipitation. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Mineralization of dissolved ions in the subsurface leads to local changes in permeability and perturbs transport characteristics. Understanding the feedback between permeability reduction and transport is critical to engineered systems such as geologic storage of supercritical CO2 [1, 2], enhanced soil stabilization [3, 4], and co-precipitation of heavy metals in contaminated aquifers [5, 6]. Induced mineralization is commonly engineered using two approaches: (1) barrier production along a mixing interface [7,8], and (2) distributed mineralization via the injection of a solution that becomes supersaturated throughout the formation [9,10]. The gradual transition to mineralization using approach (2) results in growth structures that alter transmissivity in dramatically different ways [11, 12]. Our ability to predict the outcome of induced mineralization strategies relies on our mechanistic understanding of the feedback between mineral precipitation, transmissivity reduction, and solute transport.
A number of sources suggest that the distribution and extent of transmissivity reduction can be controlled using microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) strategies [9, 13, 14]. This approach relies on coupled physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms that change local properties. In fractured rocks, MICP is expected to reduce fracture aperture, but the parameters that control the temporal and spatial distribution of mineral precipitation are not well understood. |","Document Type

The study of fracture initiation from a cavity in rock has been largely motivated by the extraction of petroleum and natural gas from a borehole and therefore, is often considered as one of the most challenging problems in rock mechanics. An unresolved issue is relating the fracture parameters from small scale laboratory test to a large scale engineering process. To investigate fracture initiation from a borehole, cavity expansion tests were conducted in the laboratory on specimens of Berea sandstone. To capture the failure process near the circular cavity, digital image correlation (DIC) was used. In addition, a two dimensional bonded particle model was developed and validated. For investigating the effect of scaling on fracture parameters (e.g. critical pressure), several larger specimens with different tension softening behavior were tested numerically. It was shown that size plays an important role. Furthermore, using the DIC measurements, it was found that fracture initiates at 80% of peak internal pressure for the rock tested.

This paper presents an efficient global sensitivity approach based on the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the FM-DDM to assess the uncertainty of geomechanical reservoir parameters. The proposed approach was evaluated in the context of the global sensitivity analysis in a large-scale NFR subjected to injection and production operations. The geomechanical parameters were selected as the rock mechanical properties (shear modulus, Poisson ratio and normal joint stiffness), and minimum far-field stresses, and the performance measures were chosen as fluid pressures in the injector and producer wells. The results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach since it allows establishing the relative contribution associated with the uncertainty of the geomechanical properties (main factors and interactions) in the variability of well performance metrics using a computationally expensive fluid flow-geomechanics numerical reservoir simulations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Unconventional petroleum reservoirs contain vast resources to supply the energy demand in the United States. However due to their ultra-low matrix permeability, the development of such reservoirs depends mainly on the ability to transport the underground fluid to the surface through extensive natural fracture networks subjected to geoemachanical deformation of the rock and fractures. Fluid injection and extraction operations are usually carried out in Naturally Fractured Reservoirs (NFR). The performance of this recovery process strongly depends on the flow properties of the fracture network and then controlled by geomechanical reservoir parameters, which are usually defined under uncertainty.|A important step for the design and control of injection and production operations in those reservoirs is to find the relative contributions of the geomechanical parameters (e.g., material properties and far-field stresses) in the variability of given performance measures (e.g., bottomhole pressure) under large-scale situations.|Previous works have determined the effects of geomehcanical parameters in reservoirs performing a local sensitivity analysis [1-4]. On this parametric study, the individual effect of each input parameter on the output response is determined in a one-byone basis by keeping constant the values of the remaining parameters. Mathematically, it can be seen as the partial derivative of that function with respect to its variables. However, the accuracy and usefulness of this approach is limited because the interaction effects when two or more parameters are changing at the same time are ignored.The expansion of a circular cavity, such as a production well in rock, has been of considerable interest for decades.

In this study, a hydro-geomechanical coalbed methane reservoir characterization workflow was applied to multiple multilateral wellbore stability cases from the same coalseam formation. The data from core studies and borehole geophysical logging was integrated to create a full field hydro-mechanical earth model. The models were then used for uncoupled reservoir geomechanical simulation. The uncoupled simulations results were history matched against observed gas and water production rates. The initial and evolved stress tensor from the simulation was used to provide insight into observed horizontal CBM wellbore stability issues including borehole: initial failure, fines generation, and failure during depletion.
1. INTRODUCTION
Coalbed methane (CBM) in the Western Canadian Basin in Alberta has been identified as a major resource that can add to Canada's energy economy by filling part of the gap left by declining conventional gas reserves. In Alberta, the CBM industry has gone from relatively little activity prior to 2003 (less than 100 wells drilled per year), to more than 18 000 total wells as of 2012 being drilled for CBM, with some wells are comingled gas wells [1].
In the Mannville coal formations, production rates in vertical wells are typically less than 3000 m3/day. However, some successful horizontal wells have gas production rates greater than 12,000 m3/day. Based on historic data, economic viability of methane extraction from the Mannville formation is believed to be possible only through the drilling of horizontal wells, which provide greater connectivity to the coal reservoir surface [2]. Horizontal wells have been used extensively in the United States for CBM development, but transfer of technologies from the USA to the Mannville formation in the Western Canadian Basin has not been as successful as originally expected.
Several reasons for the limited success of horizontal wells production have been postulated, with geomechanical effects being included. The list of geomechanical effects includes: high stress fields, high stress anisotropy, weak coal, and coal natural fracture (cleat) closure |","Document Type

This research examines stress variations with depth in the Permian Basin Spraberry/Dean/Wolfcamp Shale to understand why many microseismic events occur at upper formations when we hydraulically fracture the lower formations. An interesting phenomenon of drilling-induced tensile fractures is observed in the image log. That is, there are drilling-induced tensile fractures in the Spraberry and Dean formations, but there are no drilling-induced tensile fractures in the Wolfcamp formation. This brings out a question: how variable is the stress state with depth? We estimate the pore pressure and the three principal stresses with depth to answer this question. The pore pressures and minimum principal stresses are analyzed from the Diagnostic Fracture Injection Test, which are consistent with literatures. Maximum horizontal stress in the Spraberry formation is constrained by observation of drilling-induced tensile fractures, while maximum horizontal stress in the Wolfcamp formation is constrained through the estimation of Uniaxial Compressive Strength. We find the stresses in the Wolfcamp formation are more isotropic than those in the Spraberry formation. More importantly, the decreasing of the pore pressure gradient and the frac gradient when going from the lower formation to the upper formation leads to many out-of-zone microseismic events.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Permian Basin represents one of the nation’s oldest and most widely recognized hydrocarbon bearing regions. Unlike other plays such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford, the Permian shows much greater geologic complexity, consisting of several unique sub-basins (Fig. 1), each with its own unique characteristics [1].
The specific area studied in this research is in Midland Basin, which is east of the Central Basin Platform, west of the Eastern Shelf, and north of the Val Verde Basin. The formations discussed in this paper are the Spraberry, Dean, and Wolfcamp series, which are at the bottom of the Permian system. The three formations are mainly shale facies, but with high mechanical complexity. Fig. 2 shows the wells we studied, which are drilled in the Spraberry/Dean/Wolfcamp formations. Most data, including sonic log data, Formation Microresistivity Image (FMI) data, and core test data, come from the monitor well M. Besides, we analyze the Diagnostic Fracture Injection Test (DFIT) in four horizontal wells, A, B, C, and D. |","Document Type

H., China University of Mining and Technology| Elsworth, D., The Pennsylvania State University| Zhu, W. C., Northeastern University| Liu, J. S., University of Western Australia| Wu, Y., China University of Mining and Technology","|Abstract
Conventional water-based fracturing treatments may not work well for many shale gas reservoirs. This is due to the fact that shale gas formations are much more sensitive to water because of the significant capillary effects and the potentially high contents of swelling clay, each of which may result in the impairment of productivity. As an alternative to water-based fluids, gaseous stimulants not only avoid this potential impairment in productivity, but also conserve water as a resource and may sequester greenhouse gases underground. During the gas fracturing processes, gas will penetrate into the borehole wall due to the low surface tension and low dynamic viscosity of the fluid and the evolution of the fractures results from the coupled phenomena of gas flow, solid deformation and damage. To represent this, a coupled model of rock damage mechanics and gas flow is presented. We investigate the fracturing processes driven by pressurization of gas within a borehole and compare it with water-based fracturing. Simulation results indicate that gas fracturing indeed has a lower breakdown pressure, as observed in experiments, and may develop fractures with greater complexity than those developed with water-based fracturing. We explore the relation between the fracture initiation pressure, breakdown pressure and complexity of fractures to both the interfacial tension and the dynamic viscosity of the fracturing fluids. It is shown that the fracture initiation pressure and breakdown pressure increase and the complexity of the resulting fracture networks decreases with increasing interfacial tension and dynamic viscosity. These conclusions are consistent with experimental observations.
1. INTRODUCTION
As an important product from unconventional reservoirs, shale gas has been produced commercially and is increasingly recognized as a “game changer” for the U.S. natural gas and energy markets in the past few years [1]. Shale gas is trapped inside formations of shale, which are fine grained sedimentary rocks with very low permeability, and more than 90% of the shale gas reservoirs need treatments to enhance their productivity, such as fracturing and acidizing [2].|","Document Type

Design of rock fall protection structures requires information about the rock fall volume distribution. When this information is not available, rock fall volumes can be estimated based on structural information about the rock fall sources. This paper examines a rock fall source where known measurable rock falls occur. As is common, the source was inaccessible for bench scale mapping and the mapping was carried out using remote photogrammetric techniques. A discrete fracture network of the source was developed based on the remote mapping. Volume calculations followed three approaches, 1) direct measurement of loose blocks, 2) simple estimates of block dimensions, and 3) modeling of a 3-dimensional volume of rock based on the discrete fracture network. The calculations were compared against fallen rock blocks surveyed on site. The volume calculations based on the discrete fracture network were in agreement with those surveyed on site.
1. INTRODUCTION
Design of rock fall protection structures requires information about the trajectory of the falling rock blocks and their volume [1,2,3,4]. Rock fall spatial distribution and heights are direct input for locating and dimensioning these structures, and falling block velocities and volumes (therefore their masses) are used to calculate the impact energies to be supported. Rock fall velocities are typically calculated using trajectory models calibrated against previous rock fall occurrences [5,6,7,8]. Rock fall volumes can be calculated from previous events if records are available, or from estimations of block sizes at the rock fall source [9,10,11]. The frequency distributions of rock fall velocities and volumes are combined to calculate the distribution of impact energies at any given location, which forms the basis for a reliability-based design of the protection structure.|","Document Type

L., CNPC Drilling Research Institute","|Abstract
In vertical cased well, cement sheath is mainly used to support casing, seal off annulus, isolate porous zones, and protect the casing from corrosive formation fluids. During the production, the integrity of casing-cement-formation system is generally damaged by perforating and fracturing processes, leading to failure of hydraulic fracturing operation. Previous studies on cement sheath rarely involve coupled numerical simulation applied to hydraulic fracturing, gaining scarce industrial experience. In this paper, a coupled numerical model for fracturing operation in vertical cased well has been set up by FLAC3D(Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continuain in Three Dimensions), to analyze the effect of formation and cement sheath on the integrity of casing-cement-formation system. The results show that cement with low Young's modulus and high Poisson's ratio is crucial to retain the integrity of the casing-cement-formation system. Fracturing operation should be initiated in sections of cement with lower Young's modulus and higher Poisson's ratio, and formation with higher Young's modulus and lower Poisson's ratio. This numerical coupled model not only can gain insight on interaction of casing, cement and formation, but also optimize the design of perforating operation for reservoir stimulation in vertical cased well. 
1. INTRODUCTION
During well cementing operation, cement hardens to form cement sheath, and then form the casing-cement-formation system. Cementing is an important procedure for well completion. The ultimate purpose is to provide effective zonal isolation of the formation which have been penetrated by the wellbore. Once a well is put into product, the wellbore conditions will change under various processes, such as the perforation of the casing, fracturing stimulation, acid treatment, etc. Pressure increases when perforation accompanied with the firing of the guns can lead to cement damage. If fracturing stimulation or acid treatment is adopted, the increase of the wellbore pressure is more harmful to the casing-cement-formation system because the fluid pressure is high and the fluid injection lasts from minutes to hours. Moreover, the change of outer loading can be applied to the cement sheath. For example, the pressure on the external surface of the cement sheath will increase because of formation creep. In this case, it may lead to fracture propagation or annulus cracks around the cement sheath, eventually lead to the failure of fracturing operation. Scholars have done a lot of experiments to study the properties of cement sheath[1,2]. Many scholars also studied the effect of wellbore pressure on the cement sheath, used the analytical model to predict well life and used the finite element model to simulate the actual working conditions[3].|","Document Type

P., Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research","|Abstract
This paper describes a method for simulating the goaf of mechanized longwall panels at shallow depth in various coal mines in India for prediction of subsidence, abutment pressure and stresses over goaf and barrier pillars. Proper modelling of goaf is necessary for the accurate prediction of stress distribution around the face and subsidence at the surface. In this paper, the broken rock debris has been modeled as a non-linear stress strain characteristic. Two characteristic properties have been identified to describe the stress-strain behaviour. This study is undertaken to find out the goaf properties for seven previously worked longwall panels. A numerical model is developed in FLAC3D, a finite difference modelling tool and the modelling procedure has been described. The results obtained from modelling were compared with field observations in case of subsidence and theoretical values in case of stress distribution over the stabilized goaf and average load on barrier pillars. This paper provides the characteristic values for the goaf properties for the three different roof-rock type which may be used for simulating the goaf.
1. INTRODUCTION
As the longwall face advances, the immediate roof overlying the coal seam, consisting of weak beds, readily cave behind the supports. The main roof lying above the immediate roof consists of strong rock beds and is selfsupporting within a certain roof span. This remains intact and exerts pressure on the barrier pillars and coalface. With the progress of mining, it eventually fails and caves in as main fall.
As the size of the worked out area i.e. the goaf increases, it gets filled up with fragmented rock material that provides resistance to the lowering of the relatively intact strata. The amount of resistance offered by the goaf depends on its compaction and caving behaviour of the overlying roof rocks. Proper modelling of goaf is necessary for the accurate prediction of stress distribution around the face and the load exerted on the face support system for designing the parameters such as support density and resistance.|","Document Type

Reservoir impoundment is a complicated problem in hydraulic engineering. It’s related to different scientific phenomena in different scales, such as valley width contraction near the dam, reservoir bank slope deformation, and reservoir-induced earthquake in the basin-scale. Pore pressure increases as water level rises up, and causes material degradation and strength reduction in several ways. The effective stress law made a remarkable success in describing the mechanical behavior of saturated soil, but its application is still limited in rock materials, especially when it comes to elasto-plastic constitutive relation. A generalized effective stress concept in elasto-plastic model for fractured rock is presented and applied in the slope deformation assessment during reservoir impoundment. The observed slope deformation during impounding process is introduced and explained. The additional plastic deformation induced by the increasing fracture pressure is the main factor of slope deformation. A case study is provided of the left bank slope of Jinping-I high arch dam. The results show that the Drucker-Prager criterion embedded with the concept of effective stress describes accurately the measured values of slope deformation, and this method is efficient and useful in the deformation and hazard assessment of hydraulic engineering projects.
1. INTRODUCTION
A number of high arch dams have been designed and constructed in Southwest China in recent years, including Xiluodu arch dam (285.5m high), Xiaowan arch dam (292m high), Jinping-I arch dam (305m high), Dagangshan arch dam (210m high) et al. The rock slopes in the dam sites are characterized by large-scale, high geostress and developed fractures. Although high safety factors are achieved in the optimized schemes of the dams, the impounding deformation of slopes and its influence to the dams are still of great significance. Typical hydraulic catastrophes related to the impounding process include the Vajont dam, the Malpasset dam and some other cases. The Vajont dam suffered from a reservoir-induced landslide and the catastrophic consequences, which occurred 3 years later after the initial impoundment [1-3]. The failure of the Malpasset dam was attributed by some investigations to the seepage forces in the fractures of foundation [4-6]. The dam heel cracking of Kolnbrein arch dam was also during the initial impoundment [7].|","Document Type

A laboratory investigation has been carried out to investigate delayed initiation of hydraulic fractures where wellbore pressures are insufficient to induce instantaneous breakdown. The delayed initiation process we are investigating is related to so-called static fatigue, which refers to a property of many brittle/quasi-brittle materials, including rocks, to fail in a delayed manner when subjected to an applied stress that does not exceed the material strength. In this paper, we experimentally verify a limiting case of a theoretically predicted delay time of initiation for given wellbore pressures. The investigation has two parts: characterization of the static fatigue behavior of a given rock and hydraulic fracture initiation experiments. For rock characterization, three-point and four-point bending tests are used to obtain time to failure versus applied tensile stress relationships for Coldspring Charcoal Granite specimens. Then, using an apparently geometry-independent static fatigue parameter and classical hydraulic fracture breakdown theories, we predict and subsequently test the time to failure for different wellbore pressures in the laboratory. We present our laboratory observations and measurements on delayed failure of axially oriented hydraulic fracture initiation. Our results verify the existence of delayed initiation of hydraulic fractures, and they demonstrate the ability of straightforward theoretical considerations to predict the initiation time. Comparison between experimental data and prediction also suggests that the effect of fluid penetration plays an important role in delayed initiation, evidenced by the tendency for the longer-time initiations at lower pressures to fall below the theoretical prediction.
1. INTRODUCTION
Most approaches to stimulation of horizontal wellbores rely on initiation and growth of more than one hydraulic fracture. Past studies on the topic of initiation of hydraulic fractures predict the wellbore pressure at which initiation will occur [1-6]. In the classical hydraulic fracture breakdown models (Hubbert and Willis [1] and Haimson and Fairhurst [2]), initiation will not occur if the near-wellbore tensile stress induced by fluid pressure is less than the tensile strength of the rock formation. However, it has been observed in many laboratory experiments that brittle/quasi-brittle materials, including rocks, can be caused to fail after a period of time when subjected to a sustained static load that is lower than its strength [7, 8]. This behavior is referred to as “static fatigue.” In one recent example, Kear and Bunger [8] show that for a crystalline gabbroic rock, applying a load as low as 75% of its nominal tensile strength onto the sample can cause failure within a few hours. Therefore, the concept of tensile static fatigue in brittle/quasi-brittle rocks leads to the central question of this paper: Is it possible for a hydraulic fracture to be initiated under wellbore pressure less than critical breakdown pressure? We seek an answer by theoretical study and laboratory experimentations.|","Document Type

The Jinping I high arch dam in China, with 305 m dam height, is the highest arch dam of the world at present. The overall stability of the dam and foundation is a protuberant problem due to the complex geological conditions at the dam site area and the weakening effect of the dam abutment weak structural planes when the project put into operation. In this paper, firstly, the weakening effect experimental research was carried out under the coupling interaction of stress field and seepage field. Through the test, the weakening rates of the strength parameters of the weak structural planes were obtained. Secondly, the three-dimensional geo-mechanical model comprehensive method test was carried out under reinforced foundation conditions. In the experiment, the integrated strength decreased range of weak structural plane was determined as 30% according to the weakening effect experimental results, and the temperature analogous materials were developed to simulate the weakening effect. Through the test, the deformation characteristics and failure mechanisms of the dam and dam abutment were obtained. And the overall stability safety factors were determined as 5.2~6.0. The research results provide an important scientific basis for the design, construction and safe operation of the project.
1. INTRODUCTION
2 class soft rock and the green schist lens develops in the marble strata are also have the characteristic of decrease the mechanical parameters under the influence of water. After the impounding and operation of the high arch dam project, the mechanical properties of these weak rock masses and weak structural planes will be changed greatly. So that the strength weakening behavior has a serious impact on the stability and safety of the Jinping I high arch dam and foundation, and these weak structural planes combine with high ground stress, high earthquake intensities and high hydraulic thrust will definitely control the stability of Jinping I Project. How to quantitatively reveal the weakening effect under thousands of tons of water load and long-term effect of complexity seepage field after the project put into operation, as well as to reasonably reconsider the weakening effect in evaluating the overall stability of high arch dam and foundation is a very important research subject.|","Document Type

Underground storage of CO2 will lead to chemical fluid-rock interactions which may potentially alter the porosity and the flow patterns in faults. In this study, we present a coupled numerical model combining chemical fluid-rock interactions, aqueous diffusion, fluid flow, and mechanical processes, aiming at a better understanding of mineral reactions leading to changes of the rock properties, the associated flow patterns and the mechanical stability of faulted caprock on the long-term (500 yrs). In the examples that we studied the mechanical stability of the caprock system was not affected, but significant porosity changes were predicted for low-consolidated fault gouges. Coupled chemical-flow modelling is preferred over chemical modelling as this showed significantly higher porosity increases.
1. INTRODUCTION
Global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) into the atmosphere, mainly as a result of fossil fuel burning and cement production, is believed to significantly influence global warming [1]. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is potentially able to reduce these emissions on a short to medium time scale by storing CO2 in geological structures of the deep subsurface. The CO2 is trapped below a sealing caprock in porous media like sandstones or carbonate rocks. One of the main risks associated with storage activities is the leakage of CO2 into shallower regions of continental groundwater systems [2]. The release of CO2 results preferentially in water acidification and potential mobilization of trace elements, which may have a toxic effect on the environment [3]. Uncertainties are mainly related to potential leakage mechanisms, through faults and fractures, along wellbores and sealing caprock material, by convection and diffusion.|","Document Type

Drilled shafts socketed in crystalline rock salt are a common type of foundations used in the Dead Sea region to support high vertical and lateral loads. The existing subsurface condition consists of soft clay followed by crystalline salt. Due to the difference in nature and geological features, the performance of such foundations type under vertical loading in the crystalline rock salt is different from their known behavior in common rock types. This paper is an attempt to understand the real behavior of socketed drilled shafts in crystalline salt through a finite element modeling of a field pile load test carried out in this formation. The studied case is of a steel tubular pile provided with a reinforced concrete socket in the crystalline salt formation. The prevailing salt layers in the pile test area are highly fractured crystalline rock salts of variable strength ranging from weak to moderately weak. Full details of the pile load test, description of the subsurface conditions and salt strength tests are presented in this paper along with the finite element analysis details and results. The developed shear resistance along the socket length of the pile is verified and compared to the commonly used correlations for rock formations. The performed analyses and comparison with the field pile load test results provided a better understanding and good information about the drilled shafts performance under vertical loading condition in such formation. The analyses carried out in this paper deal with the short term behavior of the Dead Sea rock salt as the creep effect directly impact the long term performance.
1. INTRODUCTION
Behavior of concrete piles socketed in rock depends on many factors such as the rock strength, rock quality, concrete strength, drilling fluids effect and roughness of the interface surface. Rock characteristics are highly affected by the weathering and environmental conditions. Finite element analysis (F.E.) has proven a good ability to simulate the soil and rock behaviors in wide range of civil engineering applications. For the study of the performance of piles socketed in the Dead Sea crystalline rock salt using the F.E. approach, choosing the reasonable constitutive model is an essential factor. Accordingly, in this paper three different constitutive models that are the Linear Elastic (LE), Mohr-Coulmob (MC) and the Hardening Soil (HS) have been investigated. The geotechnical parameters of the rock salt needed for the different models were estimated based on several sources that are the laboratory tests, in-situ tests and the back analysis of the field pile load test results. More emphasis in choosing the geotechnical parameters was given to the in-situ tests results and the back analysis outcome to eliminate the scale effect playing an important role in the laboratory tests results.|","Document Type

We investigate the mechanisms for rock-burst using the numerical Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) method. Using recently developed non reflective boundary and excavation sequence modeling capabilities we are now able to model dynamic deformation in high in-situ stress environments more accurately than before. First we perform verifications of P-wave propagation through a one-dimensional elastic bar and confirm DDA accuracy provided that the block length with respect to wave length is properly conditioned. We then test a newly developed radial P-wave propagation module to emulate an underground blast. We study two possible rock burst generation mechanisms: 1) due to strain relaxation as response to opening in high in situ stress environment, and 2) due to nearby blasting. A very strong relation between the initial stress and the velocity and acceleration of the ejected key blocks following the removal of the tunnel section is reported. We also find that the influence of blasting on rock burst phenomena is strongly related to the initial in situ stress level. We conclude that under relatively low in situ stress environments nearby blasting may indeed ejection of originally stable key blocks. However, under high in situ stress conditions strain relaxation poses a much greater rock-burst risk.
1. INTRODUCTION
A rock-burst is the sudden displacement of rock block that occurs in the boundary of an underground excavation, and causes substantial damage to the excavation [1]. Due to the great risk to worker safety and the extensive damage to equipment, rock-bursts are considered to be one of the biggest unresolved problems in deep excavations.
There are two basic rock-burst mechanisms: 1) Strain relaxation that leads to the displacement of excavation surfaces, in which case the source and damage are concurrent, and 2) Seismic wave propagation from energy redistribution that is induced by explosions and drilling in the excavation, in which case the source and the damage might be separate in distance and time [2].|","Document Type

With the application of TBM in the construction of tunnels, increasing simulations are taken on TBM tunnels. This paper first proposes the concept of utilizing Block Theory to simulate TBM tunnels in discontinuous rock masses and analyze the stability of surrounding rock blocks in TBM tunnels. Therefore, block classification for TBM tunnels is set up according to the main differences between TBM tunnels and tunnels using traditional methods, which has laid the foundation of simulating a TBM tunnel. What' more, the identification of Influenced Block and the simulation procedure of a TBM tunnel are both illustrated in flowchart. Also, a simple example of a double shield TBM tunnel excavation is implemented based on BLKLAB and the corresponding removable blocks are analyzed. Moreover, a representative excavation step is picked out to illustrate the removable blocks around the TBM, which meets the block classification for TBM tunnels.
1. INTRODUCTION
As one type of complex discontinuous medium, rock masses in nature are split into rock blocks by finite and infinite discontinuous geological planes. Recently, the block theory [1] has developed rapidly as a stability analysis method of discontinuous rock masses. Applying the block theory, researchers have carried out various analyses on the stability of blocks in the excavation of slopes, caverns and tunnels, from which reliable results have been achieved as well [2-7].
Compared with traditional approaches of D&B (Drilling and Blasting) method and NATM (New Austrian Tunneling Method) in tunnel excavation, TBM method has the following advantages of fast heading rate, short construction period, favorable working environment, eco-friendliness and high comprehensive benefits, making it become the preferred choice at home and abroad. In recent years, researches on the simulation of TBM tunnels mainly focus on FEM [8] and FDM [9], while the block theory has not ever been applied in the simulation of TBM tunneling.|","Document Type

A parametric analysis comparing the influence of different factors on predicted induced principal stress around the cavity roof was performed. A finite difference method (Flac2D) was applied to study a cavity under internal pressure. The influence of internal pressure, cavity geometry (size and shape), horizontal stress, depth of was studied. The maximum normal stress criterion also known as Coulomb’s criterion is based on the Maximum normal stress theory. According to this theory failure occurs when the maximum principal stress reaches the ultimate strength of the material for simple tension. Based on this theory, the largest principal stress will initiate cracks in the rock and lead to the failure of rock mass. The results show the high impact of internal pressure, cavity geometry (size and shape), and horizontal stress, depth of cover. A suggested algorithm is presented for applying two dimensional finite difference method in order to predict the maximum cavity size that can be obtained without stability concerns. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The economic extraction of thin-seam coal deposits with thicknesses of less than 1 meter are often problematic due to several significant limitations associated with conventional mining methods, operating practices, and equipment. Mines with low-seam heights are endemic of operations that possess low labor productivities, high operating costs, and relatively small production capacities. Furthermore, the ability to implement new equipment and automation in order to efficiently exploit these thin-seams is hampered by the limited cash-flow positions of most of these operations and the inability to amortize their high costs over a sufficiently large resource base. Consequently, these mines are usually small, labor intensive, and rely extensively on used and rebuilt equipment modified to operate in these challenging work environments.|","Document Type

Rock mass treatment using fluid injection is common in various industrial applications, including enhanced recovery methods in the oil and gas industry, rock mass pre-conditioning in the mining industry, and heat extraction in geothermal systems. Non-isothermal fluid injection requires consideration of the thermomechanical perturbation as well as hydro-mechanical processes. Thermal effect is rarely included in injection analysis for geothermal application and thermal enhanced oil recovery methods, although with long times their impact becomes of first-order. In this paper, a fully-coupled, hybrid numerical model is implemented to study the effect of cold fluid injection into a conductive fracture under different injection/cooling schemes. The results show that the thermoelastic effect soon overwhelms the hydroelastic effect adjacent to the injection source, whereas far from the injection point, hydroelastic effect dominates because the pressure front always moves faster than the cold front. In addition, the fracture becomes more susceptible to shear failure in the presence of both thermoelastic and hydroelastic induced stresses for the case of cold fluid injection. The magnitude of the changes implies that an appropriate thermo-hydromechanical (THM) model is an essential key to address the physical behavior and potential impairment of fracture conductivity under thermal stimulation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock mass treatment using fluid injection is common in various industrial applications. Fluid is usually injected under a constant rate or injection pressure to fulfill the intended engineering goal of the stimulation practice. In the oil and gas industry, as an example, large volumes of water are injected at constant pressure during secondary recovery phase for waterflooding the oil-bearing reservoirs with low pressure (with respect to the minimum principal stress) to displace part of the remaining oil toward the production well [1]. In the mining industry, rock mass pre-conditioning using hydraulic fracturing may soon become standard practice for stope mining to facilitate caving propagation and fragmentation management [2]. On-going research interests are pursuing fluid injection as an in-situ stress and rock mass stiffness management tool [2, 3].|","Document Type

This paper attempts to investigate the mechanism of induced rockbursts and inherent rockbursts of pillars in hard rock mines. By considering rockbursts as an instability (buckling) problem of structures, rockbursts are classified into induced rockbursts and inherent rockbursts according to their occurrence with or without dynamic stimulation forces. Induced rockbursts occur where the causative factor is dynamic loadings, whereas inherent rockbursts happen only when a mining structure becomes unstable under static loadings. Rigorous mathematical models are set up for these two rockbursts. For induced rockbursts, the quantitative relation between induced blasting and rockbursts is established and parametric resonance mechanism is found. For inherent rockbursts, the condition of critical static loads is obtained. Contrary to conventional methods where only rock materials or rock specimens were used to study rockbursts, this investigation attaches more attention on the structural effect on rockbursts, which tends to appeal to practising engineers.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rockbursts are sudden and violent failure of rocks, which may lead to high fatality rates, losses in production and equipment, and a detrimental influence on the recruitment of labor. In spite of the increased use of microseismic monitoring, improvements in the associated instrumentation and widespread applications of seismological data analysis techniques, the mechanism of rockbursts in underground rock engineering is still not well understood. Ortlepp said that “it is probably true that rockbursts have been the mining hazard that is the least understood and the most feared” [1]. In the 16th annual Kenneth Finlay Memorial Lecture in Australia, Suorineni (2013) claimed that rockburst is the cancer in geomechanics of contemporary deep mining.|","Document Type

The interactions between defects are important in the behavior of brittle materials. The micromechanical interactions between a circular hole and a crack under uniaxial compression are investigated in this paper. Experiments of specimens containing a hole and a crack are conducted. Subsequently, Particle Flow Code 2D (PFC2D) is adopted to simulate the fracture behavior. The crack initiation, propagation and coalescence with a hole are investigated. The propagating cracks contain first cracks and secondary cracks. Both first cracks and secondary cracks will disturb the stress field and displacement field. The DEM simulation explains the initiation position of secondary cracks observed in experiments, which is not necessarily located at the crack tips or on crack surfaces, but possibly in the intact part of the specimen at a distance away from the pre-existing crack. The hole will influence the crack initiation stress of the pre-existing crack and attract the propagating cracks. The present research paves the way for using the DEM to simulate the micromechanical interactions between a hole and a crack.
1. INTRODUCTION
The interactions between a crack and a circular hole in rocks have been studied previously [1]. However, the prior study focused on the fracture phenomena by experiments and did not analyze the inherent mechanism in-depth. Further, the interactions were interpreted by micromechanics [2]; however, the cracking behavior was ignored. The cracking process around a hole was examined in uniaxial compression tests in some papers and relative mechanism was interpreted [3,4]. Compared with the studies of specimens with a hole, there are much more research of specimens with pre-existing cracks in a brittle material. Wong and Einstein [5] observed and characterized the fracture behavior in gypsum and Carrara marble specimens containing a single crack under uniaxial compression and identified different crack types based on their geometry and propagation mechanism. Cracking behavior were investigated containing two parallel open flaws experimentally at macroscopic and microscopic level [6,7]. Specimens under the biaxial compression test were also investigated [8]. Not only open flaws, but also closed flaws in a brittle material had been studied [9]. Specimens with 3 and 16 cracks were made and tested in compression tests [10]. However, these investigations did not consider the situation containing both a crack and a hole.|","Document Type

H., TNO Petroleum Geosciences| Orlic, B., TNO Sustainable Geo-Energy| Hoedeman, G. C., TNO Petroleum Geosciences; Baker Hughes","|Abstract
Wellbore zonal isolation is particularly important for subsurface storage of CO2 , where well integrity must be ensured for very long time spans. In this study, three dimensional discrete element models of wellbore systems have been used to simulate failure and damage of wellbore cement and surrounding rock. The models allow simulation of wellbore failure and damage in wellbore systems with different geometries and with perfect (idealized) or imperfect plug-casing-cement and cement sheath-rock interfaces. The aim is to determine critical stress conditions for mechanical wellbore failure and associated damage. Comparison of model simulations with conventional geomechanical analysis is used to determine limits in injection pressures. If these limits are exceeded, wellbore failure and upward fluid migration through wellbore cement may occur due to alignment of fractures and the formation of connected fracture networks. Imperfect cementation or a cement sheath that is not evenly distributed around the wellbore enhances local damage or failure. Although the analysis relies on upper bounds on the changes in stresses around wellbores caused by an increase in pressure, it shows that loss of well integrity during injection of CO2 or other fluids may occur, in particular by axial loading due to reservoir compaction.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wells that penetrate subsurface CO2 storage complexes may act as potential pathways for leakage of CO2 to the surface [e.g., 1-3] . For storage of CO2 to be meaningful, well integrity has to be ensured for large injection volumes and over much longer time scales (100’s to 1000’s of years) than in the case of hydrocarbon production (10’s of years of depletion). Ensuring well integrity not only during injection period but also in the post-operational period over such long timescales represents a challenge for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects that is not encountered before in the E&P industry. The long term-ability of wells to inhibit CO2 migration has been identified as a significant potential risk for the long-term security of geological storage facilities [e.g., 2]. The risk of leakage through “old” abandoned wells requires particular attention. Regulations for well abandonment were less comprehensive than they are today. In addition, future use of abandoned reservoirs for CO2 storage was not taken into account when old wells were completed and abandoned. The risks of leakage through abandoned wells may be a showstopper for a CCS project as it was in the case of CO2 storage in the depleted De Lier field in the North Sea, offshore of the Netherlands [4]. The project was discontinued after a feasibility assessment of CCS found that there was a high potential for leakage through old wells. Repair of these wells was uneconomic and in some cases, technically impossible.|","Document Type

A series of tests were performed on a manually fractured (subparallel to bedding) and propped (using quartz sand) shale plug to determine the extent to which the proppant fractured and the effect the proppant had on the fracture wall when subjected to reservoir conditions. The specimen was repeatedly subjected to reservoir conditions of 20.7 MPa confining pressure, 6.9 MPa differential stress and a temperature of 75°C. While at reservoir conditions the sample permeability was measured. Periodically the specimen was removed from the test system and scanned with a X-ray micro computed tomography machine to visualize the fracture and proppant. Noticeable decrease in flow was observed with subsequent testing due to fracture closure. This can be attributed to observations of clay swelling, proppant embedment/fracture, and shale wall spalling leading to a decrease in effective fracture aperture. Flow induced particle transport clogged flow paths and impeded flow. It was observed that isolated grains tended to crush whereas continuous grain patches tended to fracture with little displacement and tended towards embedment.
1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years the United States has become the largest producer of both petroleum and natural gas. This is a direct result of source rock exploitation through drilling and hydraulically fracturing long horizontal bore holes. While there is no dispute that this process has been effective and profitable there is still much that is not well understood about the life of proppants and fracture connectivity downhole. Production declines from these sources are higher than conventional wisdom predicts. Therefore, it is important to better understand the fracture and proppant placement process so that it can be tailored to help maximize production while minimizing environmental impact.|","Document Type

Traditional modeling approaches for hydraulic stimulation treatments typically make the assumption that the formation can be modeled as a linear elastic material under static equilibrium. As such, all information regarding the transient response of the formation is neglected. However, during a hydraulic stimulation treatment, transient geomechanics forces are exerted on the formation, which modify the stress landscape near the wellbore and fracture planes. In regions where the horizontal stress anisotropy is less than 25%, the potential for a temporary reversal in the minimum stress direction exists. During this brief time window, a secondary hydraulic fracture can be created in a completely different direction, thus providing direct connectivity to previously unattainable locations in the formation. This paper presents a computational validation of this process using a unique transient 3D computational geomechanic fracture simulation. This new stimulation method enhances current standards in hydraulic fracturing by requiring an understanding of the transient geomechanic response in the treatment area. 
1. INTRODUCTION
During a hydraulic stimulation treatment, geomechanic forces are exerted on the formation, which temporarily modify the stress landscape near the wellbore [1, 2]. This phenomenon is often referred to as stress shadowing, and is traditionally considered a negative byproduct of hydraulic fracturing treatments. The increased compressive stress caused by the first fracture acts to naturally divert subsequent fractures, and can significantly limit the fracture growth [3]. Under certain circumstances, the stress shadowing can create a full reversal of the local minimum and maximum stress directions (Fig. 1), causing the next fracture to propagate perpendicular to the original in-situ maximum stress direction [4]. Several modeling efforts, similar to those conducted by Morrill and Miskimins [4], have been undertaken to better understand the sensitivity of various formation and treatment parameters on the size of the stress shadowed region. The goal of these studies was to predict the extent of the effected zone for prescribing optimal fracture spacing along the lateral section of a horizontal well to prevent fracture interference. |","Document Type

A., The University of Texas at Austin| Heidari, M., The University of Texas at Austin| Hudec, M. R., The University of Texas at Austin| Flemings, P. B., The University of Texas at Austin","|Abstract
We study how stresses change as a salt diapir evolves into a salt sheet with no concurrent sedimentation. We find a reversal in the stress direction, as the radial stress changes from being the maximum stress when the diapir is rising, to minimum when the salt sheet is advancing. We study an axisymmetric diapir with the large-strain FE program Elfen. We model the salt as solid visco-plastic, and the sediments as poro-elastoplastic materials. During the diapir rise, the salt applies a horizontal thrust load onto the upper parts of the basin. However, as the diapir evolves into a sheet, the effective height of the salt diapir drops, and so the stress within the salt decreases. At the same time, the vertical stress within the basin increases because of the weight of the advancing sheet. We hence predict a change in the orientation of the minimum principal stress within the wall rocks associated with a switch from horizontal shortening to extension. Furthermore, the ratio of minimum effective principal stress to effective overburden decreases after the salt emplacement, and shear stresses below the salt sheet change. Overall, our results highlight that forward evolutionary modeling can improve borehole stability calculations below salt.
1. INTRODUCTION
A salt sheet is an allochthonous salt body sourced from a single feeder, whose breadth is several times greater than its maximum thickness [1]. The most common type spreads laterally from the top of a feeder diapir, and forms when the upward rise of the salt in the feeder is much faster than the local sedimentation rate [2]. Salt sheets are a common feature in salt systems around the world, including a very strong presence in the Gulf of Mexico [1]. Prediction of stresses and pore pressure below salt sheets is increasingly important for the exploration stage of drilling programs. New plays have been discovered beneath allochthonous salt [3-6]. However, there are several documented examples of drilling problems in such locations that have led to additional expense or even abandonment [3-5, 7, 8]. Improving the prediction of the stress state below salt sheets will benefit the design of the most economic well trajectory, best casing plan and overall borehole stability.|","Document Type

Numerical simulations were used to study three methods for modeling hydraulic fracturing in low permeability formations: simple geometry (SG), mixed-mechanism stimulation (MMS), and primary fracturing with shear stimulation leakoff (PFSSL). Simulations with SG have a small number of hydraulic fractures and do not explicitly represent natural fractures. The PFSSL conceptual model assumes one or a few large hydraulic fractures at each stage, with fluid leakoff into explicitly represented natural fractures. The MMS conceptual model involves a larger number of hydraulic fractures and includes the effect of hydraulic fracture termination against natural fractures and other planes of weakness. The simulations in our study were performed using a discrete fracture network simulator that efficiently couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation. Our investigation focused on conceptual model of stimulation affects parameters observed at the field scale: fracture network length, the impact of induced stresses, stimulation heterogeneity, and trends in initial shut-in pressure (ISIP) along the well. Compared to models with SG, it was found that PFSSL or MMS models yielded results more consistent with common observations from field data. The SG simulations exaggerated the effect of induced stresses, lacked the variability and heterogeneity commonly observed in field data, predicted very low net pressure, and had excessively long fractures unless relatively high matrix permeability was assumed. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Conventional hydraulic fracturing models assume simple fracture geometry, such as a single planar fracture per stage [1]. However, a variety of observations suggest that fracturing creates complex geometries [2-7], especially in unconventional resources [8, 9, 10].
A variety of numerical and analytical tools are being used to describe hydraulic fracturing in unconventional formations. Most assume that one or a few large planar fractures form per stage. Some of these models use discrete fracture networks to explicitly model the leakoff of fluid from the primary fracture(s) into surrounding natural fractures, which experience stimulation in response to the increase in fluid pressure [11, 12]. We refer to this type of model as ""primary fracturing with shear stimulation leakoff"" (PFSSL). Other approaches use one or a few hydraulic fractures per stage and do not explicitly represent the stimulated natural fractures [13-17]. We refer to these ""simple geometry"" (SG) models. A third class of model incorporates the effect of hydraulic fracture termination against natural fractures. In these models, large, continuous hydraulic fractures are unable to propagate through the formation because they sometimes truncate against natural fractures or other planes of weakness. Instead of forming one or a few dominant hydraulic fractures, stimulation creates a more distributed and branching network that includes both new and preexisting fractures [18-22]. We refer to these models as ""mixed-mechanism stimulation.""|","Document Type

The potential for a particle to crush under one-dimensional compression is critically dependent on the coordination number of that particle. Neighboring particles decrease deviatoric forces at contacts, which reduces tensile stress and subsequent fracture propagation in the crushable particle. This phenomenon is called “shielding effect”. In this paper, we model a sand particle as a spherical cluster of bonded, hexagonally packed, equally sized, non-breakable spheres with the Discrete Element Method (DEM). We use rigid walls to apply forces at the contact with neighboring particles. First, we calibrate the cluster mechanical parameters against published experimental results obtained during unconfined uniaxial compression tests. Then we propose a procedure employed in DEM to generate symmetric and random distributions of walls. We use two loading walls only: the remainder of the walls is used for passive shielding. Force-displacement curves obtained during the crushing simulations clearly show that the peak force reached when the cluster first splits increases with the number of shielding walls, which demonstrates shielding effects. The total resulting compression force applied by the walls increases linearly the coordination number. We expect that our computational method will allow the optimization of crushing in powder technology, and the prevention of crushing in geotechnical engineering.
1. INTRODUCTION
Mechanical particle crushing is used in civil engineering, powder technology and mineral industry. The most elementary crushing event is the crushing of a single particle subjected to highly compressive stresses. Single particle compression tests, in which an individual sand grain or rock stone is vertically compressed between two horizontal platens, are often used to study crushing at the particle-scale [1-3]. Crushing depends on particle size, shape and coordination number [4-6].|","Document Type

The aim of this study is to present an analytical probabilistic approach using Monte Carlo Simulation method to estimate the minimum horizontal in situ stress magnitude from a single Leak-off test (LOT) acquired in highly deviated well in a sand interval inside the reservoir section, accounting for the uncertainties in some of the key input variables such as maximum horizontal in situ stress magnitude, and rock mechanic properties (Young Modulus, and Poisson’s Ratio). The major assumption used is that the Leak-off test (LOT) acquired was a representation of the fracture initiation pressure in the sand interval. A field case in a deep water turbidites oil field located offshore Brasil is presented to illustrate the application of this approach. The result of this study provides a full probabilistic density function (PDF) for the estimated minimum horizontal in situ stress magnitude. The result also indicated that the minimum horizontal in situ stress contrast between the reservoir and the overlying cap rock is relative small in any cases as expected in shallow and unconsolidated sediment environment.
1. INTRODUCTION
Estimation of the minimum horizontal in situ stresses in the reservoir and cap rock is critical in onshore and offshore waterflood projects either if they will be executed at fracture or matrix conditions. Intentionally or unintentionally induced hydraulic fracture can breach the cap rock, eventually leading undesired fluids to the surface creating considerable environmental problems. As a result, interest in determination of minimum horizontal in situ stress has increased in recent years. Thus, it is extremely important to ensure that the injection can be maintained in a safe and effective manner. 
The minimum horizontal in situ stress can be determined by direct measurement via hydraulic fracturing, mini-fracs [1], and extended leakoff test (XLOT) [2]. However, it is quite often that only a limited leak-off test (LOT) is acquired during drilling operation, and used as a measure of the fracture initiation pressure (Pw), i.e., not a valid measure of the minimum horizontal in situ stress. The present work is aimed to use a probabilistic approach to estimate this in situ stress magnitude, hence, providing a critical input into the operational envelope for the water injection in the field under study.|","Document Type

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of thermal conductivities and Young's moduli of damaged materials (high-porosity material with the lowest absorption of X-rays in computed tomography images) on tensile stresses and tensile damage evolution during heating and cooling of a downscaled casing-cement-rock assembly. Tensile failure was predicted during thermal cycling of the casing-cement-rock assembly at both heating and cooling stages. The failure occurred predominantly in damaged cement and damaged rock. The simulation results suggested that cement immediately adjacent to the casing pipe is most prone to tensile cracking during both heating and cooling. Reducing stiffness of damaged materials reduced the overall number of tensile cracks, and introduced a small amount of cracks in the intact cement. Reducing thermal conductivity of damaged materials increased the overall number of tensile cracks, and introduced a small amount of cracks in the intact rock and a significant number of tensile cracks in intact cement. The results indicate that tensile cracks may be generated even in the intact cement during heating, if there is sufficient contrast in thermal conductivity between damaged and undamaged materials.
1. INTRODUCTION
Injection of relatively cold or hot fluids into cased wells is not uncommon in oil and gas industry. Injection of hot fluids takes place e.g. under huff-and-puff stimulation and during steam-assisted gravity drainage. Cooling of a cased well can occur during injection of CO2 into underground reservoirs for permanent storage. Heating or cooling may have an adverse effect on well integrity. In particular, tensile thermal stresses can be induced in cement around casing. Cement is a brittle material. Its tensile strength is typically much lower than its compressive strength. Tensile thermal stresses can therefore produce cracks in bulk cement or at an interface between cement and casing or rock. Such interfacial cracks, once joined together, can make up a conductive fracture network and act as a conduit along the well. This can enable fluid flow between geological strata and thereby violate zonal isolation principles. This will call for remedial measures which can be expensive. Therefore, being able to predict mechanical stability around wells subject to heating, cooling or thermal cycling is crucial for safe and environmentally-conscious operation of wells.|","Document Type

This paper discusses the most common forms of drain clogging and its influence on seepage under concrete dams built on permeable rock foundations. The increments of the uplift pressure caused by reduction in drain length or diameter, reduction of its effective flow section, reduction of flow to the drain and the reduction of the permeability of the rock mass around the drains is discussed. The parametric studies were based on a nonlinear numerical model developed for three dimensional seepage analyses of concrete dams with permeable continuous or fissured rock foundations. The main conclusions are that all causes abovementioned could induce clogging but some are more critical than others. Reduction of the drain’s length, filling of the drains with granular or fine materials and joint clogging around the drains tend to be the more critical situations. Dams sitting on high permeability materials are more susceptible to clogging than those with low permeability foundation since the flow captured by the drains is higher in the first case. The importance of proper drain maintenance to maintain the dam's stability is stressed.

S., University of Oklahoma","|ABSTRACT: Hydraulic fracturing is integral to geothermal and hydrocarbon recovery. Rock tensile strength is overcome using a pressurized fluid during the initiation of a fracture. Tensile strength has historically been assumed to be a stress independent property of rock depending solely on the rock type. Previous studies on igneous rocks suggest otherwise. Our experiments on Berea and Tennessee sandstone show a dependency of tensile strength on the confining stress. Confined Brazilian tests were carried out to observe the tensile fracture initiation and propagation under confined stress conditions. Strain gauges recorded the deformation leading to and during failure. The measurements show a strong dependency of tensile strength on confining pressure; however, tests were limited to a maximum confining pressure of 1000 psi. As the strain data indicate, confining pressure hinders the microcrack growth and nucleation leading to higher tensile strengths with increasing confining pressure. Tennessee sandstone which has a higher tensile strength at atmospheric pressure than Berea sandstone shows slightly greater increased tensile strength with confining pressure. |1. INTRODUCTION  |Experimentally measured rock properties are employed to predict and interpret underground rock behavior. This transition between laboratory and field condition, however, needs delicate attention. Properties such as rock compressive strength, fracture toughness, fracture energy, etc. depend, in fact, on the state of stress. In other words, they are a coupled function of material and in-situ condition. Field scale hydraulic fracturing treatments (Cleary et al. 1991; Shlyapobersky and Chudnovsky, 1992) indicate apparently higher fracture energy than compared to unconfined laboratory measurements. Fialko and Rubin (1997) simulation of Abou-Sayed (1977) experiments show substantial dependence of fracture energy on the confining pressure. Tensile strength is another parameter which is important for hydraulic fracturing treatments. To overcome the tensile strength, the pore pressure is increased injecting fluid under high pressure in the wellbore. The pump pressure builds up until the pressure is high enough to break the rock. This pressure is known as breakdown pressure at which the hydraulic fracture initiates.|","Document Type

A large number of world-class high arch dams are currently under construction or will soon be built in West China. These dam projects are usually located in high mountains and deep valleys with complicated geological conditions. The global stability and safety of dam and foundation is a major concern. Geo-mechanical model test is one of the main methods to study this problem. Three test methods of geo-mechanical model are presented in this paper. The overloading method is used to test the overload capability. The strength reduction method is used to study the strength reserve capability. The comprehensive method combines overloading and strength reduction methods. According to the model similarity theory, the safety coefficients by three kinds of model test are established, and the testing technique based on temperature-dependent similar material for simulating strength reduction is also proposed. These basic studies offered the theory and technical supports for dam model test.

Creep is a term used to describe the time dependent behavior of rock. Knowledge of creep can be used to predict different phenomena such as reservoir subsidence associated with production, wellbore stability and proppant embedment problem. In this work, we investigate creep behavior at small scale using Nanoindentation. After the initial Nanoindentation loading stage, the indenter tip is held under constant maximum force for a period of time while deformation is recorded. The measured creep values are compared for different materials including soda-lime glass, Lyons sandstone, Sioux Quartzite, pyrophyllite, and Indiana limestone. The measurements on shales are then presented. The experiments measure comparably higher creep values for shale, i.e. 10 times higher than the one for fused silica. This creep depends strongly on the composition. It correlates positively with Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and clay content, while correlates negatively with carbonates. The measurements reveal a directionally dependent (anisotropic) creep with a higher value in the direction perpendicular to the bedding. Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP) and acoustic velocity measurements are correlated with the creep. The measured creep value could be an indicator of the volume of smaller pore sizes (nanometer scale) which are extensively found in the organic and clay components. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Time dependent deformation of rock is an important factor for considerations of underground dynamics. This phenomenon can be predicted based on laboratory scale creep measurements under constant stress conditions. The behavior of rock under this constant stress usually consists of three distinct strain response stages. Figure 1 symbolically illustrates these three different stages: 1) primary or decelerating, 2) secondary or “steady state”, and 3) tertiary or accelerating creep (Heap e al., 2009). The creep strain rate is derived using the linear portion (secondary stage). Nanoindentation method has been used successfully to evaluate various aspects of material mechanical behavior at a smaller scale. To name a few, Oliver and Pharr (1992) deduced hardness and modulus of the tested materials using the loading and unloading curves. Fracture toughness can be estimated after modification (Lawn an Marshall, 1979). Fatigue and impact load can be applied using some modifications (Beake et al., 2001). Bower et al., (1993) examined a creeping solid under Nanoindentation. In this report, the Nanoindentation method is employed to evaluate the creep behavior of the candidate rocks in a finer scale.|","Document Type

Petroleum geomechanics is a multidisciplinary branch of petroleum sciences which aims to understand, model, and control the mechanical response of subsurface geo-materials, such as reservoir rocks and cap rocks. Major geomechanical properties are usually obtained from destructive tests using standardized laboratory procedures and, for practical reasons, the mechanical characteristics of reservoir rocks should be measured at the reservoir conditions. In this study six geomechanical units (GMUs) in a carbonate reservoir in an Iranian gas field (T ~ 90°C) were defined and then 24 plugs were taken from the cored intervals. Afterward, uniaxial compression tests were performed at 20°C and 90°C. Various geomechanical properties including unconfined compressive strength (UCS), Young’s modulus (E) and Poisson’s ratio (?) were determined and compared with each other. Results show that temperature may have some impact on the UCS of specimens but different GMUs show different kind of impacts and most were unaffected in this temperature range. Although E values vary from one GMU to another, temperature has almost no effect on this parameter for each GMU. Moreover, experimental results show that not only is there no significant difference among values of ? for each GMU, this parameter is also not sensitive to temperature changes. We conclude that, given normal dispersion of results and heterogeneity of rocks, for this class of rocks at these conditions, it is sufficient to execute tests at room temperature for engineering design purposes. 
1. INTRODUCTION
The branch of petroleum engineering called petroleum geomechanics aims to understand and predict the mechanical behavior of reservoirs and adjacent formations through the full process of exploration to exploitation to abandonment [1, 2]. Generally, basic geomechanical characteristics of rock material are obtained from experimental tests on core samples at ambient conditions. To define these characteristics under in-situ conditions at depth (temperature, confining stress, pore pressure, saturation etc.), may require extensive laboratory experiments [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] at more challenging and expensive conditions.|","Document Type

Based on review of overburden collapse mechanism in both coal and evaporites, over the last three decades, the author finds empirical methods that are used for assessing cavability inadequate. These empirical methods suggested by Polish researchers are too simplistic offering limited usefulness for estimating face support loading without quantifying the caving characteristics of the main roof strata, ability to concentrate stress, and release it in preferably nonviolent fashion. With the advances in numerical modeling, it is possible to study strata failure and movements in a jointed rock mass for better assessment of cavability and load transfer using both continuum-based and discontinuous models. However, the challenge remains with having reliable stress measurements in the caved zone and around the excavations for calibrating the computer models and establishing design methodologies in caving mining systems. Direct measurements are needed but are rare because of difficulties of placing load cells in the gob.
Using direct measurements in the gob, back analyses of overburden collapse mechanism, and other measurements over the last three decades in the room-and-pillar mines, the author examines the caving mechanism for western US sedimentary rocks. The significance of joint orientation and persistence is highlighted as well as the critical role of stable designs including the use of barrier pillars strategically located to control load transfer and seismicity in room-and-pillar mines, mining under massive stratigraphic units in some of the Western U.S. mines.
1. INTRODUCTION
Caving mining systems have been used in the United States and Europe for over a century. However as mining continues toward higher cover, it has become critical to evaluate cave conditions for assessment of load transfer, and seismicity during the feasibility analyses and later in design of mine layouts and support systems. In spite of great advancements in methodologies for estimating insitu strength and deformability of rock masses [1], the understanding and characterization of caving, load transfer, and seismicity is still at an early stage. Empirical methods commonly used for assessing cavability are inadequate and further affected by our inability to measure load transfer through the gob for different geologic conditions [2, 3, 4]. Direct measurements are rare with the only known available case described in this paper. Empirical methods suggested by Polish researchers [5] are too simplistic, offering some guidance about ease of caving but lacking any quantification of resulting stress concentration and release of energy in preferably nonviolent fashion.|","Document Type

The thermal regime of a formation in the vicinity of a wellbore affects the stability of the well significantly during drilling operations, especially for deeper or geothermal wells. This paper describes how the thermal behavior of a tubular-wellbore-reservoir system is altered with time during mud loss, as well as its consequent impact on wellbore state of stresses and critical mud weights. A new coupled thermal-poro-elastic model, integrated with a transient tubular-wellbore-reservoir heat flow model, is developed to evaluate near-wellbore stresses and pore pressure redistribution during a mud loss. The results reveal that continuous mud loss destabilizes the near-wall region as the fracture gradient decreases over time. This can intensify the existing fracturing condition and allows the development of new fractures at other locations, which leads to further losses as time progresses. During severe losses, the fracture gradient at the bottom of the well can decrease by over 1 ppg within the first few hours. The time- dependent critical mud weight window and near-wellbore state of stresses under different lost circulation conditions and types of muds (OBM/WBM) are presented to evaluate the effects of different parameters. This model allows prediction of a more realistic operating window during lost circulation by taking additional thermally-induced effects into account.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wellbore instability is a major source of additional costs to drilling operations, and is therefore of paramount importance to avoid when drilling for petroleum production. It is more likely to occur when drilling in hostile environments, such as weak and/or reactive formations; formations with tectonically active beddings [1]; formation with unfavorable lithology sequences; and formation with high pressures and temperatures [2]. In addition, the increasing use of directional drilling and extended-reach drilling (ERD)[3], as well as underbalanced drilling and multilateral drilling[4], has increased the difficulty of maintaining stability of the wells significantly[5,6].
Wellbore stability problems have been extensively studied during the last few decades. Many wellbore stability models have been developed to describe the physics of the systems by considering multiple effects, including but not limited to mechanical effects, pore pressure effects, chemical effects, and thermal effects. Based on the effects that have been taken into account, the wellbore stability models can be categorized as: pure elastic model[7,8,9]; poro-elastic models[10,11]; thermal-poro-elastic models [2,12,13,14] ; chemo-poro-elastic models [15,16,17,18,19]; thermo-chemo-poro-elastic models [20,21], etc. |","Document Type

This paper attempts to provide a simple analytical solution for the calculation of stress tensors induced in a linear elastic ring of a brittle material subjected to parabolic loading over two symmetric strips of its outer perimeter. Using the Michell- Fourier series technique and Airy stress functions, stress components are investigated in a tensile positive fashion. Results are obtained in series form to facilitate parametric studies on the influence of the loading angle and geometric characteristics of the ring on the maximum tensile stress. Results indicate that for a ring with a small hole, the type of the imposed stress is crucial in determining the distributions of the stress components inside the ring domain, although it becomes almost negligible for a ring with a relatively large hole. In contrast, a large inner to outer ratio influences significantly the stress values at critical points of the ring experiencing the maximum tensile stress.
1. INTRODUCTION
Stress and displacement analysis of cylindrical annular bodies under arbitrary tractions is one of the classic topics of Elasticity, with its major applications in Machine Design Theory and strength measurement of materials [1]. The ring test has been widely accepted as an indirect laboratory technique for measuring the tensile strength of a material in the shape of a circular solid cylinder (disc) containing concentric holes subjected to lateral compression until a tensile failure occurs. The growing application of the ring test in geotechnical engineering, particularly in rock mechanics, is directly tied to the ease of sample preparation and its unique breakage mechanism in a pure tensile mode. There is a vast body of literature devoted to calculating the induced stresses in the ring test aimed at producing relationships for estimating the tensile strength of a test material as functions of the ring’s geometrical aspect ratio and the imposed contact conditions. Timoshenko [2], Filon [3], Ripperger and Davis [4], Bortz and Lund [5], Hobbs [6], Jaeger and Hoskins [7], Chianese and Erdlac [8], and Kourkoulis and Markides [9], among others, have proposed analytical solutions for the ring problem. However, they are often limited to simplified stress assumptions at the contact, e.g. line-forces or uniform radial stresses, or Muskhelishvili's complex potentials [10] to account for the complicated boundary conditions, e.g. parabolic contact loadings. Despite the generality of complex-variable schemes; however, such approaches require excessive and complex mathematical rigour, limiting their application to broader disciplines. In contrast, focusing on the analytical-methodological aspect, this study attempts to construct a simpler and more convenient easy-to-use treatment for the study of stresses when the ring is subjected to parabolic radial compressive stresses over two finite arcs of its lateral surface (Figures 1 and 2).|","Document Type

We use a simple analytical model to estimate the stress field in and near density-driven, rising salt domes. We show that the salt pressure within such domes varies linearly along the dome but with a magnitude greater than the overburden stress. We also show that the salt dome changes both the magnitude and the direction of stresses in adjacent sediments: the maximum stress increases higher than the overburden stress, and the minimum stress drops below the regional one. The maximum stress lies and the minimum stress lies tangent to the dome boundary in the circumferential direction. The magnitude of the salt pressure and of the sediment stresses is estimated from the density profile of sediments. These predictions are shown to agree with field observations near salt domes. Our results provide critical insight into the stress field perturbation in and near rising salt domes and can be used to assess the accuracy of numerical models and field measurements near these domes. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Salt domes can harbor significant oil reservoirs. Salt’s extraordinary ductility makes salt domes an ideal seal to trap hydrocarbons flowing along margins of basins. In the Gulf of Mexico, the reservoirs trapped by salt domes are estimated to contain undiscovered recoverable resources of at least ~ 13 billion boe [1]. 
It is important to estimate the stress field in and near rising salt domes. Wellbores are often drilled near and through these domes to reach hydrocarbon targets trapped near them [2-5]. The stability of these wellbores depends on the current state of stress near the domes. In contrast to sediments, salt cannot sustain differential stresses. To accommodate an isotropic stress state, salt deforms and causes substantial perturbation of the regional stress field in adjacent sediments. Therefore, well-established approaches used to estimate the sediment stress field often fail near salt domes [6-9] because they have been derived for regional conditions [10-12].|","Document Type

The Brazilian Test was modeled with FLAC to investigate the effect of loading angle on stress distribution and failure mechanisms in homogeneous and heterogeneous rock samples. The model was first calibrated to data of a Standard Brazilian test of a PMMA sample, found in the literature. Then several numerical Brazilian tests were performed using virtual materials with different deformability. The numerical results indicated that the loading angle (i.e. contact length between the jaw and the disc) is not constant in the Standard Brazilian test and changes depending on the amount of applied load and the deformability of the disc. This means that the contact length will be larger for materials with higher tensile strength and lower Young’s modulus. The contact length affects the distribution of both tensile and compressive stresses in the disc. Therefore, it can influence the failure mechanism of the disc. If the contact length is low, probability of shear failure increases close to the loading region, and if it is high, tensile failure is more probable at the center of the disc.
Furthermore, Uniaxial Tensile (UT), Standard Brazilian (SB) and Brazilian tests with constant loading angle of 30° (CLAB) were simulated. Heterogeneities were introduced as inclusions with their tensile strength and Young's modulus randomly selected from a normal distribution with different standard deviations. The analysis indicated that as the standard deviation of the Young's modulus and tensile strength distribution increases, the recorded peak load and peak tensile strength decreases for the three tensile test configurations. However, UT is much more sensitive to the variability of tensile strength than of Young's modulus. In contrast, the SB and CLAB tests indicated more sensitivity to Young's modulus variability.|","Document Type

This paper aims to quantitatively explore effects of effective radial stress change (<U+0394><ed><U+00A0><U+00B5><ed><U+00BC><U+008F>'<ed><U+00A0><U+00B5><ed><U+00B1><U+009F>) around a wellbore because of cement shrinkage in a 2D elastic isothermal state. As cement shrinks, the formation moves inward and the radial stresses diminish. This induced change can be problematic if the total radial stress falls below the formation pore pressure in the outside-the-casing environment (the hydraulic fracture condition). If this occurs (<ed><U+00A0><U+00B5><ed><U+00BC><U+008F><ed><U+00A0><U+00B5><ed><U+00B1><U+009F> < po), fluid migration risk is massively enhanced because a connected vertical microannulus (fracture) is a pathway for buoyant upward gas movement. To model stress change, we use simple Kirsch equations and a computer code based on a radial shrinkage percentage in the cement to calculate the new effective radial stress. Similarly, using ABAQUS software, the possibility of surface detaching between the formation and cement bond has been modeled. Numerical results show that, based on the geomechanical properties of a formation and the cement shrinkage percentage value in the cement sheath, upward movement of fluid is possible, even likely in many circumstances. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Gas Migration (GM), gas invasion, or gas seepage (in a more general form “fluid” migration) has been an oil and gas industry issue for decades. This problem is important for the oil and gas industry because in cases of formation fluid migration, the integrity of a wellbore will not be sustained completely and can lead to environmental issues [1]. Even if the environmental impacts are minimal, leakage events have a large social impact, and this aspect of the risk involved must be properly managed. 
The term gas migration is commonly used, but a better understanding of the seepage mechanisms is essential. During a wellbore’s life, from well construction (drilling and completion) to decommissioning (well abandonment) and thereafter, the possibility of migration remains present. Not surprisingly, many researchers have tried to identify and explain the mechanisms [2, 3] from their perspectives, but a general scientifically supported consensus still seems unachieved.|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing is a reservoir stimulation technique which in unconventional (e.g., shale gas or oil) plays is required to generate sufficient reservoir contact to enhance production. Frac design approaches use fracture spacing, sequence, and other parameters to enhance fracture complexity through modification of the local stresses within the stimulated area. Conventional frac designs consist of a series of stages within a well stimulated sequentially, from toe to heel. A newer promising design is a Zipper frac, where two or more parallel horizontal wells are stimulated stage by stage alternating between wells in a “Zipper” pattern. The effectiveness of Zipper fracs has been demonstrated by industry; however, the treatment optimization is still under development. In this paper a fully 3-D reservoir model is used to capture some of the fundamental effects which influence fracture growth during stimulation using three different stimulation approaches, for two different well spacings. The three designs are investigated are: Conventional, in which all stages in sequence are stimulated first in Well 1, followed by Well 2 and then Well 3; Zipper frac, in which Stage 1 is stimulated in Wells 1, 2, and 3 and then Stage 2 is stimulated in each of the wells, repeating until all stages are stimulated; and Modified Zipper frac, in which Stage 1 is stimulated in Well 1, then in Well 3, then in Well 2, and the same sequence is repeated. Following each stage the fractures are numerically propped so that their residual aperture is 50% of the total aperture, eliminating any surfaces with apertures smaller than 0.0025 meters as too small to receive proppant. In this way we can compare the relative fracture surface area which remains productive among the different approaches. The results reveal subtle but significant changes in the stress state due to the different stagings both as a function of time during the stimulation (which will affect subsequent propped aperture) as well as after the entire sequence is pumped. The greatest area is achieved for the modified Zipper sequence; the improvement is larger for the closer spacing of the wells. These changes in turn result in differences in total propped area which will lead to differences in IP. One interesting consequence of the analysis is that although the initial propped area is larger if wells are farther apart, the ratio of propped area to total area available to be drained is smaller suggesting that the initially higher IP for the larger well spacing is achieved at the cost that ultimate recovery for the field is likely to be lower.
1. INTRODUCTION
One of the primary goals of hydraulic fracturing is to maximize the effective fracture surface area that connects the reservoir volume to the wells. The operational parameters that can be relatively easily manipulated include fracturing fluid properties, injection rate, proppant quantity and schedule, and the spacing and stimulation sequence of stages in a multi-well multistage system (pad). Recent studies (Roussel et al., 2011; Rafiee et al., 2012; Rios et al., 2013,) have suggested that it is possible to achieve greater “complexity” of the resulting fracture network through appropriate engineering of the staging and cross-well stimulation sequences. There is no clear definition on which the above papers agree for the term “complexity,” nor is it clear how they treat each fracture after injection into that fracture is complete. Rather than address this issue here, we focus in this paper on the differences among the different effective surface areas of the primary fractures. And, we clearly define the behavior of each fracture after it has been pumped and propped.|","Document Type

The interaction of hydraulic fractures with the pre-existing natural fractures may play a major role in increasing productivity from unconventional formations. When a hydraulic fracture meets a natural fracture, the hydraulic fracture can cross the natural fracture or be arrested. If the natural fracture is permeable, fracturing fluid can leak from the hydraulic fracture into the natural fracture causing elevation of pore pressure in the natural fracture and reducing the effective normal stress acting on the natural fracture, which could then lead to shear failure or slippage along the natural fracture plane. Shear-slip causes dilation, potentially increasing fracture conductivity and enhancing fluid flow deeper into the natural fracture. The conductivity of unpropped shear-induced fractures can play an important role in enhancing the productivity from ultralow-permeability formations like shale. In this paper, we first evaluate analytically the shear-slip condition and its propagation along a natural fracture under remote normal and shear stresses, when it is exposed to the fluid pressure in a hydraulic fracture. Analytical approximations under some limiting conditions are considered. A rigorous 2D numerical model based on coupling between fluid flow and rock deformation using displacement discontinuity method and fluid flow in the fracture is then described. The results of numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effect of rock stress anisotropy, initial natural fracture conductivity, and fluid properties on the evolution of the fluid and slip fronts along the natural fracture and the associated permeability enhancement.
1. INTRODUCTION
In the last decade, following the success of horizontal drilling and multistage fracturing in the Barnett Shale, exploration and drilling activities in shale gas and shale oil reservoirs have skyrocketed in the US and abroad. Economic production from these reservoirs depends greatly on the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing stimulation treatment. Microseismic measurements and other evidence suggest that creation of complex fracture networks during fracturing treatments may be a common occurrence in many unconventional reservoirs [1-3]. The created complexity is strongly influenced by the preexisting natural fractures and in-situ stresses in the formation. To optimize the fracture and completion design to maximize the production from these reservoirs, engineers must have a good understanding of the fracturing process and be able to simulate it to obtain information such as the induced overall fracture length and height, propped versus unpropped fracture surface areas, proppant distribution and its conductivity, and potential enhanced permeability through stimulation of the natural fractures.|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing is a widely used technique in oil and gas production to increase the permeability of near-well reservoir and enhance hydrocarbon recovery. Modeling hydraulic fracturing involves solving coupled multi-physics equations in a robust numerical solution scheme. We present a generalized finite element framework to simulate the propagation of fluid-driven fractures in a linear elastic medium. The fluid flow within the fracture is described by the Reynolds lubrication equation, where the classical cubic law links the fluid pressure gradient and the flow rate in the fracture plane. The GFEM framework allows fractures to propagate inside the cells, and thus finite element discretization can be non-conforming with fracture geometry. The fluid front is tracked to permit fluid lag during the simulations. A unified traction-separation law is proposed to model the mechanical behavior of the fracture faces, including contact, cohesion and interface strength softening. The traction-separation law on the fracture faces is enforced by a penalty method. The coupled nonlinear system is solved by a standard Newton-Raphson method. Several 3D numerical studies and benchmarking examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework in modeling fluid-driven fracture propagation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a technique widely used in the oil and gas industry to enhance hydrocarbon recovery from underground reservoirs. The process often results in the initiation and growth of tensile fractures, typically driven by viscous fluid that is injected into the rock with relatively high flow rate and high pressure. After the fracture is generated, certain sand-like propping agents (also called ’proppants’) are introduced into the newlyformed fracture to prevent full closure after the fluid pressure is released. Studies on hydraulic fracturing can also be found in other geomechanical applications such as geothermal energy recovery [1], transportation of magma through earth’s crust [2], sequestration of CO2 [3], embankment dam failures [4], and induced caving in mining [5].|","Document Type

In this study, we developed a new Numerical Manifold Method model for the analysis of coupled hydro-mechanical processes in fractured, porous rock. The fractures are considered as porous media with nonlinear behavior of hydraulic and mechanical properties involving both direct (poro-elastic) and indirect (property-change) couplings. Based on an energy-work model, we stringently established all components of the work related to fluid flow and mechanical processes in porous media in a unified form and their direct coupling. For indirect coupling, we derived a new formulation that implicitly considers the nonlinear fracture properties and deformation by directly assembling the corresponding strain energy. Compared with traditional methods with approximation of the nonlinear constitutive equations, this new formulation achieves more accurate representation of the nonlinear fracture deformation behavior. With the new model, we developed a new computer code in our Numerical Manifold Method package. We tested the code with very dense mesh for direct coupling on (1) a classical poroelastic column and (2) a semiinfinite media under strip load, respectively and compared the results with the analytical solutions, achieving very good agreement. Finally, we tested for direct and indirect coupling on a model with a single dominant fracture and obtained sensible results.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydro-mechanical (HM) coupling refers to the interaction between hydraulic and mechanical processes that may be triggered by mechanical loading/unloading or fluid injection/extraction. This interaction is significant in geological engineering, such as oil and gas extraction, geothermal energy, nuclear waste disposal, where the geological media usually consist of fractured rock [1]. These fractured rock masses may contain fractures with complex geometry and fillings, thus could be modeled as a fractured porous media. Basically, the mechanisms of HM coupling in fractured porous media are: (1) Direct coupling, i.e. the poro-elastic instantaneous undrained coupling between mechanical and hydraulic fields. Specifically, the fluid pressure affects deformation while the volume change affects the pressure distribution. (2) Indirect coupling, i.e. interaction between mechanical and hydraulic fields indirectly, through their properties. Specifically, the effective stress change, affected by fluid pressure change, would change the stiffness of fractures, while the deformation of fractures change their hydraulic conductivities [1- 2]. |","Document Type

Natural and hydraulic fractures in shale reservoirs are essential for providing transport conduit for the movement of fluids during fluid injection and extraction. Variations of flow conditions in the reservoir induce tractions on the fractures that potentially cause a joint to slip or micro-earthquake (MEQ) when the shear stress exceeds a critical value based on a failure criterion. Proper identification of subsurface events in a large-scale situation is of great interest for the geothermal and petroleum industries to monitor potential modification of fracture permeability during production operations as well as hydraulic fracture propagation in stimulation treatments. The Displacement Discontinuity Method (DDM) is commonly used for modeling the behavior of fractures in linear-elastic rocks. However, DDM requires the calculation of the influences among all fractures, so it is not computational efficient for large fracture systems. This work involves using the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) with DDM to simulate large-scale naturally fractured reservoirs subjected to production and injection. Synthetic case studies containing up to ten thousand fracture elements in reservoirs with and without sealing faults are carried out and the microseismic responses analyzed. The results show the approach to be effective and efficient. In addition, the results do illustrate the role of the fluid pressure on the fracture failure mechanism in large-scale situations. Potential shear slips associated with stimulated zones in the reservoir are most likely to occur near the injector wells where the pressure is higher. Finally, fractured reservoirs with faults experienced more events due to the compartmentalization that causes zones of higher pressure to develop.

An area in the Southern Perth Basin has been identified as a potentially suitable site for CO2injection, due to its proximity to major CO2emission sources and the presence of potentially suitable geology. The project for testing and proving up of the storage area is known as the South West Hub Project or SW Hub. Recently acquired 2D seismic and well data have allowed a detailed description of facies, measurement of rock properties and development of a 3D structural model for the area. This 3D model has been used as the basis for a preliminary fault seal analysis and also for the development of simplified geomechanical models for the SW Hub using FLAC3D. The geomechanical modelling used in situ stress (magnitude, orientation) and pore pressure conditions as a starting point and then simulated CO2injection from a single well at rates of 1 to 5 million tons per year for 20 years. No matter whether weak or strong faults were used, no faults were reactivated nor the top seal breached under any of the simulated injection rates. Average uplift in the weak fault scenario was modelled at between 0.4 and 1.8 cm for injection rates of 1 to 5 million tons per year. The strong fault model showed slightly smaller uplifts. The majority of uplift was noted in the first 5 years of injection and flattened off rapidly after this point in time. This is consistent with geomechanical models from other CO2storage sites and from actual field measurements.

In each stage, multiple perforation clusters are often used to create multiple fractures to provide adequate drainage along the entire horizontal well and, at the same time, to achieve economic goals. However, the production contribution from each perforation cluster has been found to be highly uneven. One of the reasons for low cluster efficiency is that effective fractures are not created from all the perforation clusters. Field observations have shown that the magnitude of fracture breakdown pressure can vary significantly along a horizontal wellbore. Both the magnitude and the variation of fracture breakdown pressure can cause ineffective fractures and low cluster efficiency. A computer hydraulic fracture simulator was used to study the breakdown of multiple fractures from a horizontal well. The measured breakdown pressures from actual fracturing treatments in a horizontal well are used in the simulation. The simulation results show that only a limited number of fractures can be generated for a given pump rate, independent of the number of the clusters available in a stage. The number of fractured clusters depends on the magnitude and variation of fracture breakdown pressure. The simulator has also been used to show cluster efficiency can be improved by perforation designs, as well as by advanced diversion techniques.
1. INTRODUCTION
The success of unconventional reservoir development relies on the technology of multistage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells. In each stage, multiple perforation clusters are often used to create multiple fractures to provide adequate drainage along the entire horizontal wellbore. However, the production contribution from each perforation cluster has been found to be highly uneven, with 40% of the perforation clusters contributing little to no production [1, 2]. In recent years, engineered staging completions based on rock properties and log data along the horizontal wellbore have been used to improve the cluster efficiency with some degree of success [3, 4].|","Document Type

Methods allowing to estimate the size and aperture of induced hydraulic fracture are essential for a proper design of unconventional reservoir well stimulation. In this paper, we focus on ultrasonic velocities monitoring during hydraulic fracturing of a tight shale. We report experimental results, where a sample was first loaded in a polyaxial loading frame and then fractured by injection of a viscous fluid at a constant flow. During the experiment, P-wave velocities were periodically measured in different directions. Our results show that ultrasonic measurements can be useful for understanding the mechanics of the hydraulic fracture growth. More precisely, from the evolution of the P-velocities and their amplitudes during the loading, we are able: (i) to estimate the velocity of the hydraulic fracture growth; (ii) to show that propagation of a liquid-free crack always precedes the liquid front; (iii) to estimate the aperture of the hydraulic fracture.
These results show that ultrasonic velocities monitoring can yield direct measurements of fracture width, length and dynamics of propagation. These inferred properties of the hydraulic fracture can also provide verification of the results of various theoretical models describing fracture propagation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Detailed characterization of rock fracturing induced by fluid injection is very important task for oil and gas industry, where hydraulic fracturing is crucial to enhance hydrocarbon production, as well for microseismic monitoring of intrusive dykes in the earth crust. The conditions under which fluid-driven fracture propagates within rocks are usually not well defined. Several fracture-propagation theories have been developed. Pioneer contributions have been made by Barenblatt [1], and more recently by Detournay et al. [2-4]. However, there is a certain lack of direct field measurements of the hydraulic fracture dimensions, verifying results of these models.|","Document Type

C., University of Pittsburgh| Bunger, A. P., University of Pittsburgh| Savitski, A. A., Shell International Exploration and Production, Inc.","|Abstract
This paper presents laboratory experiments designed to explore the interaction between hydraulic fractures and preexisting natural fractures that are strongly cemented but over only a portion of the natural fracture. The results show that a hydraulic fracture penetrates directly through a fully and strongly cemented pre-existing natural fracture. We then vary the proportion of the natural fracture that is strongly cemented. In most of these partially-cemented cases, the hydraulic fracture is observed to persist through the entire height of the specimen both before and after the interface. However, the fracture path persists directly through strongly-cemented portions while there are offsets at uncemented portions. A fully debonded result is obtained when the cemented region is 5 mm in height, that is, 10% the height of the interface and about 13% of the hydraulic fracture halflength at the time of intersection. The initial results of this seldom-considered but almost certainly realistic configuration of partial bonding suggest that hydraulic fracture path is strongly influenced by the size of the bonded region of the natural fracture, and, perhaps more importantly, that strong bonding over only a portion of the natural fracture can be sufficient to promote hydraulic fracture crossing. Four patterns are observed for the interaction between the hydraulic fracture and the strongly cemented natural fracture: (1) complete crossing, (2) crossing and offset, (3) crossing, partial debonding and offset, (4) complete debonding.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a widely used well-stimulation technique for enhancing the productivity of oil and natural gas in unconventional reservoirs. The interaction between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing natural fractures in a reservoir can strongly influence the fracture network geometries and is widely recognized as one of the main issues for understanding hydraulic fracture propagation in unconventional, and some conventional, reservoirs. The mechanics of the interaction of hydraulic fractures with natural fractures is often understood through some now-classical analytical solutions and mechanical models [1-4]. Work on this subject is ongoing, with recent contributions aimed at experimental evaluation of these criteria and/or development of more generalized approaches [5]. Extensive numerical and experimental studies have also been conducted to interpret and predict the mode of interaction [6-10].|","Document Type

Q., Tsinghua University| Yang, Q., Tsinghua University| Xue, L. J., Country Chengdu Engineering Corporation Limited","|Abstract
The project of high arch dam has an intense disturbance to its geological environment with high in-situ stress in the critical instability state, and the creep and damage of foundation rock mass resulting from the process of non-equilibrium evolution has an adverse impact on long-term safety of arch dam. Time-dependent deformation reinforcement theory (TDRT) has been presented for evaluating the long-term stability of arch dam. Based on Duvaut-Lions visco-plastic model and Lyapunov asymptotic stability analysis, the principle of minimum plastic complementary energy is proved for perfect and hardening yielding, in which viscoplastic structures deform tending to the limit steady state at which the PCE is minimized under time invariant loading and boundary conditions. So the PCE is a reasonable and quantitative criterion for stability evolution and unbalanced forces can be used to determine the reinforcement since they have a complete mathematical basis. The expression of PCE and unbalanced forces for finite element method have been finished base on Drucker-Prager yield criteria. This theory is implemented in TFINE, which is a parallel FEM code with GPU acceleration, and then used in the long-term safety evaluation of Jinping arch dam in China.
1. INTRODUCTION
In China, most of high arch dams are located in the southwest, such as Jinping I Hydropower Station with the maximum height of 305 m, Xiaowan Arch Dam (294.5 m), Xiluodu Arch Dam (285.5 m), etc. Due to the intensively geological uplifting of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this region has steep valley and complicated geological environment with high in-situ stress in the critical instability state. The engineering experiences and catastrophes of arch dams around the world have shown that the stability of dam foundation is the key point of the overall stability of the dam [1], so the special geological conditions of the Southwest China result in a prominent problem of the stability of high arch dam.|","Document Type

Appropriately designed support systems are required to control potentially unstable ground around entries in coal mines. Alternative support systems can be evaluated using various approaches, including empirically based methods and advanced numerical models. However, conducting numerical model analyses can be time consuming, requires special software, and requires specialist expertise for setting up models and evaluating the results. In this study, the need for a more rapid method of assessing support alternatives is addressed. A regression-based equation has been developed based on the output of more than 600 numerical model analyses that investigated entry stability in various ground conditions, depths of cover, stress conditions, and support systems that might be encountered in US coal mines. The model outputs were verified against actual performance of coal mine excavations in a variety of geotechnical settings. Least squares curve fitting procedures were used to find the unknown parameters of a nonlinear equation that includes parameters for the rock mass strength, support characteristics, and geometric layout of the excavation and support system. The developed equation can satisfactorily predict the numerical model calculated stability factors. This allows practitioners to rapidly assess support alternatives for a range of conditions using spreadsheet software.
1. INTRODUCTION
Ground falls remain a significant factor in underground coal mine injuries and fatalities. In 2013 ground falls accounted for 4 of the 14 fatalities and 166 of the 1577 reported lost-time injuries in underground coal mines [1]. The stability of underground coal mine excavations is improved by the provision of support systems that control potentially unstable ground. Support systems may consist of rock reinforcement such as rock bolts and cable bolts and may be supplemented by standing supports such as engineered wooden cribs or cement-based columns. The design of appropriate support systems is complex because of the variable nature of the rock mass and the difficulty of estimating the interaction between the rock mass and the installed support system. Over the past 25 years multiple design approaches have been used in coal mine ground control. The approaches include empirical mechanistic methods, empirical statistical analysis, and rules of thumb and numerical methods, after Hebblewhite [2]. Of these approaches, numerical methods are increasingly used to supplement empirically based designs. |","Document Type

A new constitutive model is proposed based on the generalized three-dimensional (3D) Hoek-Brown strength criterion, which was proposed by Zhang and Zhu [1, 2]. The constitutive model involves a 3D multi-segment plasticity flow rule that can not only consider the effect of the different confining stresses on the plasticity flow rule and volumetric deformation but also need no addition uncertain parameter such as dilatancy angle. The constant volume flow rule is applied at the high confining stress condition. With the specific mathematical treatment and derivation, a new interpolation and radial flow rule is prescribed at the low confining stress and the tension condition respectively, and the continuity of plastic potential function at the principal stress space is ensured. Then the new constitutive model is implemented in the three-dimensional finite element software (GeoFBA3D). A set of numerical true triaxial compressive tests are carried out and compared with analytical solutions. Finally, a real engineering example of a highway tunnel excavated in rock masses is given for validation and application. 
1. INTRODUCTION
In order to determination the strength of the rock and rock masses in rock mechanics and rock masses engineering, the Hoek–Brown strength criterion was developed for intact rock originally [3, 4] and then extended to rock masses[5, 6]. Hoek and Brown derived their strength criterion for intact rock with one of pure trial and error, and for rock masses with considering the geological condition from the field. The Hoek–Brown criterion has been used most widely in rock engineering that was due to the adequacy of its predictions of the observed rock fracture behavior, and the convenience of its application to a range of typical engineering problems. However, a major limitation for the Hoek–Brown strength criterion was that it cannot consider the effect of the intermediate principal stress. To overcome the limitation, several three-dimensional (3D) versions of the Hoek–Brown strength criterion have been proposed by Pan and Hudson, Singh, Priest, Zhang and Zhu, and Melkoumian et al. [1-2, 7-11]. Among these 3D Hoek–Brown type criteria, the criterion of Zhang and Zhu can entirely inherit the advantages of the original Hoek–Brown strength criterion and has the same expression at both the triaxial and the biaxial states. The criterion was considered as a true 3D version of the generalized Hoek–Brown strength criterion and validated by numerous test data of intact rocks and jointed rock masses. The criterion of Zhang and Zhu was named as GZZ strength criterion commonly [12] and has been accepted by other researchers on rock masses.|","Document Type

An appropriate propped fracture is important for oil and gas production (especially in shale formations). The actual proppant placement during fracturing is generally unknown. Any fair prediction of the placement of the proppant may results in significant improvements for the fracture protocol design. We present experimental data on the transport and settling of particles dragged by water through a narrow wedge-shaped vertical fracture. We discuss some basic features of the dynamics of the settlement of the proppant dune and show results on the final placement for different pumping rates and particle sizes. Results are consistent with previous findings by others and confirm that some usual practices in the field are beneficial to maximize the propped volume and minimize arching.
1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, many oil companies have directed their efforts towards developing unconventional reservoirs. The challenges encountered to guarantee a profitable operation in these plays lead the industry to devote significant amounts resources to optimize processes such as hydraulic fracturing, a vital stimulation technique.
Hydraulic fracturing consist in the injection of fluids, along with proppants, into the formation aimed at creating and/or enhancing existing fractures to open high conductivity channels connecting the formation and the wellbore [1].
Proppants are granular materials that fill the fracture and support the closing pressure, keeping the fracture conductive during production. Although fracturing techniques have evolved, there is still opportunities to increase efficiency. Many of these opportunities are related with the way in which proppants are transported and deposited into the fracture.|","Document Type

Most shale plays have to be hydraulically fractured to acquire commercial production. Shales are typically characterised by varying quantities of clay, carbonate and organic material, therefore each shale type has different deformational properties, which lead to different outcomes with respect to hydraulic fracture efficiency. Unconsolidated, high clay content or organic rich shales exhibit visco-elastic or visco-plastic behaviour, acoording to many researchers[1–3]. Although the effect of this time-dependent behaviour on fracture propagation is considerable it has not yet received much attention. The aim of this paper is to address the time-dependent response of shale under hydraulic stimulation, more specifically, to monitor fracture parameters change and deformation at crack tip area depending on the lag time between stress and strain. 
In this paper, an innovative method to analyse time-dependent deformation of material at fracture tip and its effect on propagation of hydraulically induced fractures by incorporating visco-elastic behaviour is presented. To characterise fracture state, J integral is revised and implemented in the framework of finite element model. The fracture is treated explicitly with refined mesh around the crack tip in order to obtain detailed information in static state. During loading condition, visco-elasticity and visco-plasticity is not differentiated for practical purposes. 
The results show that under a centain hydraulic pressure a crack creeps rapidly and possibly propagates. It is shown that stress intensity factor and revised J integral has a rapid changing gradient at the beginning and becomes stable over time. The crack tends to be wider and shorter in creeping shale. Propagation process is hindered by viscous energy dissipation and successive cohesive force. In simulation the experimental data from US shale plays are used to study fracture propagation behaviour under viscoelastic behaviour. Results of this study allow industry gain a better understanding of deformational behaviour of shale when fracturing. The know-how derived from this study will assist planning effective stimulation program in the development of shale gas reservoirs.|","fracture propogation, viscoplastic behaviour, crack tip zone, hydraulic fracturing, clay-rich shale"

Offshore production facilities utilize a variety of process heating equipment to help start-up production and operate efficiently. Applications include glycol reboiling, oil and gas conditioning, knock-out drum heating, molecular sieve regeneration, sea or potable water, and fuel/lube oil maintenance. In addition, oil producers have long investigated downhole and subsea heating solutions capable of decreasing viscosity, preventing wax and hydrate buildup, and providing localized heating for improved productivity. The types of heating solutions are problematic due to the large capacity and extreme environmental and process conditions involved, especially with the downhole and subsea applications. Until recently, low voltage (below 1000V) heating elements and low power heating cables have been the typical solutions for downhole and subsea electric heating applications. These traditional solutions have limitations that prevent them from significant adoption and utilization. 
This paper discusses the benefits of using medium voltage technology. The focus will be on the reduction of installation, maintenance, and operational costs, as well as the reduction of electrical power consumption and line loss associated with using medium voltage technology. Also, for large heating loads, the physical size and footprint of medium voltage electric heating systems are more compact than traditional low voltage systems. This is especially relevant on newly designed platforms which provide medium voltage power distribution. 
Finally, medium voltage electric heating technology opens the door for completely new solutions in downhole, subsea and offshore heating, as well as other process heating, in the oil and gas industry that were not possible before. It is important to present such innovation to the marketplace so that producers and operators are aware of new solutions to existing problems.|","hydrates, medium voltage heating, subsea, deepwater, offshore"

In order to address various wellbore challenges, there has been improvements in methods of drilling and other wellbore activities since a long time. While the industry focuses on improvements of different methods, reducing Non Productive Time (NPT) has also become of great interest. Amongst many, one method to address the problem of drilling through fluid loss zone and to minimize casing running time and other NPT is Casing While Drilling (CwD). It is a method of drilling in which the conventional drill pipes are replces by the casing itself. During implementation of this method, there have been several observations of enhanced wellbore strength, pressure containment, better fluid loss control, etc. Plastering effect is considered to be the factor behind this, where the fine drill cuttings physically collide with the wellbore to form a stable mud cake layer that provides additional wellbore strength. Though plethora of work has been carried out, exact phenomenon of plastering effect is uncertain. Particle Size Distribution (PSD) of the drill cuttings along the wellbore is noted to play a crucial role is proper plastering effect.

Severe borehole collapse has occurred during extended reach drillingsin shale formations of Dongping Block, Qinghai Oil-field. An extreme difficulty is to choose mud weight lower bounds properly. Previous isotropic wellbore stability model does not consider the heterogeneities in transversely isotropic porous media like shale, thus fails to predict mud weight accurately. To solve the problem, a new wellbore stability modelis proposed; and an optimized nano-type drilling fluid is designed.whichcan be applied fordrilling operation. 
The wellbore stability modelis developed through four steps: 1. The far-field stressesare transformed from an in-situ stress coordinate system to a borehole coordinate system; 2. An analytical solution for a near-borehole stress distribution in an elastic anisotropic formation under a transformed in-situ stresses regime is used, based on the complex-variable elasticity theory and the Biot's consolidation theory; 3. The around-borehole stressesare transformed from the borehole coordinate system to a weak-plane coordinate system; 4. An improved Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is used to identify rock failure mode (along weak plane or through rock matrix) and to calculate the mud weight lower bound. 
In addition, laboratory experimensts have demonstrated the ability for water-soluble hybrid nano-particles to plug shale matrix and micro cracks inside the shale, which helps to prevent chemical erosion of fluid to the rock. By sealing natural fractures with nanoparticles and optimizing mud weight using the new wellbore stability model, the borehole instability is effectively controlled. A procedure is also developed for wellbore stability analyses based on a comprehensive consideration of the formation property, the mud chemical property and the mud weight. This approach was applied to 12 deviated pilot wells drilled through shale formation in Dongping Block, where high pore pressure and natural fracture systems prevail: the mud weight is increased from previous 1.5g/cm3 to the present 1.85g/cm3. It is observed that the drilling time and the drilling complexities have been reduced by up to 52.4% and 62.4%, respectively, with significant cost savings.|","Multiple weak planes, Poroelastic anisotropy, Wellbore stability, Strength anisotropy"

A., Schlumberger| Al-Wadhahi, T., Schlumberger","|Abstract 
Microseismic monitoring has become a standard industry technique to monitor stimulation effectiveness as it provides information as to the length, height and orientation of the mapped hydraulically-stimulated fracture network and surrounding formations. In some cases, focal mechanisms may be extracted as well, providing additional insight into the geomechanical behavior of the reacting formation in relation to the spatial and temporal evolution of the hydraulically-stimulated fracture network. 
Though there is much to learn from the interaction between sensor selection, survey design, operation, etc., in this work, we focus on the surface processing of a microseismic monitoring campaign performed in the Sultanate of Oman in 2015 ultimately comparing surface-derived results with downhole-derived results and the impact of joint inversion combining both surface and downhole data. 
Given the operation parameters (e.g., wells to be monitored, formation velocities, spread limitations, completion schedule, and monitoring objectives) a pre-job modeling exercise took place to design the most effective surface and downhole monitoring array configuration. On site surveying was carried-out to ensure all health, safety and environment-related aspects were covered prior to and during the acquisition over a 67-day-long period. At the end of each stimulation, datasets acquired were processed in the office prior to results interpretation and integration with multi-domain data. 
For the data acquired with the surface array, processing steps start with pre-processing including noise conditioning (e.g., filtering and spectral whitening) and grouping (i.e., stacking and beamforming). An iterative velocity model building and calibration exercise is performed using an initial model derived from well logs, surface surveys, check-shot data and, picking of accurate perforation shot timing (and large magnitude events). Events are detected and located using a source scanning approach prior to be manually inspected and relocated as needed during a quality check and editing phase. Additional refinement of the hypocenters takes place during the moment tensor inversion exercise prior to a final quality check and editing. Both a linear (detection) and an iterative (inversion) workflows are used to ensure optimal event location accuracy and moment tensor inversion. 
Final results indicate that overall hypocentral locations derived from the surface array and the downhole array match relatively well. The integrated processing results show good agreement with the downhole-only results in the vertical dimension. Though some stages do not yield many events for reasons to be investigated (i.e., processing vs. rupture mechanism vs. completion scheme, etc.), overall mapped hypocenters highlight features aligning with the overall N50 maximum stress direction confirming the drilling pattern implemented and providing additional insight as to potential improvements. Some stages do not locate exactly where expected bringing additional value to the overall monitoring exercise and calling for in-depth understanding of the formation behavior. Moment tensor results come from the surface data only, highlighting predominantly strike-slip events with some elements showing large opening components. 
Future monitoring campaigns are considered using improvements provided by recently gained information (e.g., spatical noise pattern, energy radiation, effectiveness of channel count and distribution, etc.)|","joint inversion, hydraulic fracture monitoring, tight gas, unconventional, surface"

Keshen gas field, located in Kuqa Depression of Tarim Basin, northwest China, is an ultra-deep (7000m), high pressure and high temperature fractured tight sandstone gas reservoir with low permeability of 0.09mD and strong stress anisotropy about 30 MPa in horizontal stress contrast.

We also carried out a sensitive study to comfirm the key parameters for optimizing fracturing treatment design. Finally a new fracablity index calculation method suitable for fractured tight sandstone was built. 
It is shown that for fractured tight sandstone reservoir with strong stress anisotropy like Keshen, shear deformation of natural fractures is a key factor of creating fracture area with high permeability. And the evolution of fracture area during fracturing experienced three processes. (1)Fracturing fluid extends along natural fracture at the initial fracturing stage; (2)At a certain injection pressure, slight shear deformation happens along the plane of natural fracture. As injection pressure increases, fracturing fluid breaks through a weak point of natural fracture and propagates along the direction of maximum horizontal stress; (3)A new set of fractures with combination of tensile-opening and shearing are formed, which are caused by changing of in-situ stress field around natural fractures. These three processes happen alternately and eventually form an ideal fracture area. It is also found that post-fracturing productivity has a close correlation with the shear deformation of natural fractures. At the axis of structure or fault developed area, natural fractures with strong potential shear deformation trend are more easily stimulated, and productivity can be high after fracturing. By contrast, fractures at structure saddle or steep part have weak potential shear deformation trend and are difficult to be stimulated, and thus productivity would likely be lower. Accoding to the mechanism of fracturing, we considered that the fracability of fractured tight sandstone is a function, and the parameters are in situ stress, shearing slip deformation, brittleness and fracture toughness. 
Mechanisms of hydraulic fracturing and key factors effecting well productivity after fracturing in Keshen reservoir have been found through this study. Hydraulic fracturing treatment design and execution were conducted based on this study. After fracturing, the production performance (open flow potential) of stimulated wells increased by four-fold on average.|","Tarim Basin, Hydraulic Fracturing, Tight Sandstone Gas, Natural Fractures, Geomechanical Mechanism"

D., CSIRO","|Abstract 
During gas production, coalbed experiences compaction over time when effective stress increases as a result of pressure depletion triggered by escaping gas from micropores through desorption and diffusion. It is deemed that time-dependent compaction deformation (compaction creep) and deterioration of coal structure lead to a decrease in coal permeability. Alteration of compaction rate and permeability of coalbed depends on factors such as coal properties, pore pressure, time, and temperature. Thus far, little studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of compaction creep, viscoelastic, and viscoplastic behavior of coal on permeability. Creep may have such significant impact on coal permeability that its negligence may result in overestimation of Coalbed Methane (CBM) production. Appreciation of creep phenomenon, coal properties such as viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity, and their impact on the interaction of coal permeability and gas production borehole enables optimisation of CBM production. In this study, we aim to examin permeability models and highlight the significance of creep as a factor influencing the evolution of coal permeability and CBM production.|","Coal permeability, CBM production, Creep"

The Zhahaquan tight oil field is located in the late tertiary siltstone of the Qaidam Basin, Gansu Province, P.R. China. The field's conventional and tight reservoirs are currently being appraised with an aggressive drilling campaign. Despite an average plug permeability of about 0.3 mD and a modestly overpressured reservoir (12–16 kPa/m), hydraulic fracturing (HF) stimulations are deemed necessary to produce the light oil (31° API) at commercial rates. Stress modelling and fracture diagnostics confirm a predominately normal faulting stress regime throughout the basin, but vertical stress contrasts between formation layers highlight no potential frac barriers. 
Initial hydraulic fracturing stimulations in 8 vertical wells resulted in 6 out of 11 stages screening out prematurely, while the remaining 5 could only be completed with light proppant concentrations below 10% of fluid volume, resulting in only modest production rates. Subsequent well stimulations were designed based on refined modelling results, with which screen- outs could be avoided and initial production rates tripled. 
This study puts forward the modelling and execution of one horizontal well with 27 perforation clusters divided into 10 stages, in which the effects of fluid rheology, proppant concentration and injection rate on the resulting fracture geometry are highlighted. The study further shows that unlike in preceding simulations, the cluster- and stage spacing were optimised with respect to the stress interference between parallel fractures.|","hydraulic fracturing simulation, early screen-out"

Fractured tight sandstone formation is an important unconventional oil and gas accumulation distributed in a wide region of Tarim oilfield in China at great depth, and has several distinct features: high-pressure/high- temperature drilling environment, low rock matrix permeability, well-developed natural fracture system, and highly anisotropic in-situ stress. Even using highly inhibitive oil-based fluid during drilling operation, mud loss and wellbore collapse still occurred frequently. Moreover, in many wells when the mud weight is added, borehole conditions become not better but worse. Contrary to the traditional field experiences, collapse pressure itself has a mud weight window. 
According to the field observations and literature reviews, we built a model based on the poroelastic theory, coordinate transformation technique and temperature field simulation. We found that classical Mud Weight Window is no longer being appropriate for wellbore analysis in fractured tight sandstone foremation. Instead, a Crtical Mud Weight Window is proposed, which properly explained unusual drilling problems. 
A mud weight optimization strategy is also discussed to minimize the shear failure region around a borehole. In addition, a flow chart including the experimental equipments and calculating method is presented.This approach is applied to explain the drilling problems in 8 vertical wells drilled through Bashijiqike formation. It is observed that the new method may provide more accurate instructions for mud weight selection. 
Finally, we presented a field case study in Keshen block, Tarim field. In this case, the engineers used our method to choose the mud weight. As a result, this model offers reasonable mud weight that is useful to mitigate borehole instability in fractured tight sandstone formation.|","HPHT fractured tight sandstone formation, Critical mud weight window, Oil-based drilling fluid"

Through-tubing (TT) drilling was used to drill Upper Permian Zechstein carbonates in Germany. The project was partially set up as an experimental performance comparison between a positive displacement motor (PDM) and a turbodrill bottomhole assembly (BHA) equipped with real-time logging tools. This would be a world-first drilling run for this size of turbodrill as well as the first turbodrill run on coiled tubing (CT) using this real-time data feedback. 
Through-tubing coiled tubing (TT-CT) drilling incurs significantly lower cost per drilled footage than conventional rotary drilling methods. A dedicated candidate selection process emphasized the geometry and extent of the pay zone, borehole stability, tubing geometry, and well integrity, which are all crucial for the application of TT-CT drilling. As a result of this screening process, well Sh Z1a, a horizontal sour gas production well was selected. Dedicated BHA designs were used for both the PDM and the turbodrill to allow for a direct performance comparison whilst drilling the section. 
TT-CT drilling was used to deepen the well. Initially, 410 ft [125 m] were drilled with a 2.283-in. [58.0-mm] impregnated bit and a 2.125-in. [54.0-mm] PDM using 1.750-in. [44.5-mm] CT suitable for sour service. An additional 148 ft [45 m] were drilled with a 2.283-in. [58.0-mm] impregnated diamond bit with polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cone cutters. This bit was run with a 2.125-in. [54.0-mm] turbodrill BHA equipped with real-time logging tools using a sour-service-suitable 1.750-in. [44.5-mm] CT with a fiber-optic cable. The section was drilled under total losses and through multiple natural fractures. While drilling with the real-time logging tool, internal and external downhole pressures, torque, and tension and compression forces were recorded to assist in the drilling process. Direct comparison of the PDM and the turbodrill BHA was made for rate of penetration (ROP), weights and pressures. The turbodrill BHA produced more than double the ROP than was possible with the conventional PDM BHA using less weight on bit and showed overall smoother drilling mechanics. 
The well is currently on production. The project showed that TT-CT drilling is a viable technology for production enhancement in depleted gas reservoirs and that new turbodrill technology generates significant performance improvements over conventional drilling tools.|","Rea-Time Data, Turbodrill, Coiled Tubing Drilling, Coiled Tubing, Through-Tubing Drilling"

In this study, coal seams properties in two coal core wells are studied to identify dominant parameters controlling desorption characteristics of coals. Available published data from desorption canister tests including sorption time and gas content (lost gas, desorbed gas, and residual gas) are employed. Proximate analysis data assists in coal characterization and data from high pressure adsorption tests are used to investigate the methane adsorption on coal as a function of pressure. For fracture and cleat analysis, gamma ray, density, and acoustic image logs are used. All data and analysis combined with regional geology assist to study desorption properties of different coal seams in these two wells. 
Kalbar-1 and Peebs-1 are the two core wells in this study. Entirely different patterns (gas content versus depth) are observed which can be explained by their different geological setting. A major volcanic intrusion of approximately 60m in thickness and a few minor intrusions in the area explain abnormally high gas content of shallow coal seams. The methane Langmuir adsorption isotherm for shallow coals (composite sample) is steep and has higher gas adsorption capacity compared to other seams. The shallow coal seams have been cooked by volcanic intrusions and have higher than expected gas content. 
For Peebs-1, the composite plot of gas content, sorption time, and ash content combined with gamma ray, density, and acoustic image logs provides a useful set to study desorption properties of coal seams. The fracture and cleat analysis reveals that low sorption time generally belongs to coal seams with higher cleat and fracture density. The existence of open cleats and fractures might facilitate gas release from coal matrix. The inverse correlation observed between sorption time and ash content while maceral composition is fairly similar suggests that desorption properties might be controlled by mineral matters in this well.|","Coalbed methane, Desorption characteristics, Volcanic intrusions, Gas content, Ash content"

Core-calibrated petrophysical rock typing for gas rate deliverability profiling, coupled with field-calibrated mechanical stress models, represents a significant step forward in optimizing the value of hydraulic fracture stimulation in the Khazzan field unconventional tight gas reservoir. Our Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) is an important component of the integrated workflow currently being used for selecting intervals for successful hydraulic fracture initiation. When incorporated into an integrated subsurface performance prediction strategy, this technology enables optimization of well targeting, increased reserve recovery, and capital efficiency. 
The interaction of regional tectonics and local lithology controls the stress profiles of the layers in the Barik tight gas reservoir in the Khazzan field. Core measurements show a significant effect of rock fabric and diagenesis on effective gas permeability, elastic properties, and rock strength. The ability to incorporate lithology, rock fabric, and pore geometry in our dynamic to static calibrations provides new insights into our predictions of rock mechanical properties and reservoir quality, which are used to obtain calibrated ""fracture initiation"" profiles from core, log, and downhole stress measurement information. 
The MEM is calibrated using an integrated wellbore stability analysis and horizontal stresses are refined by honoring the observed borehole breakouts, formation breakdown and closure pressures. The models show that the adjacent layers in Khazzan field are under higher stress than the pay zones, which enhance fracture height containment and lateral fracture penetration. Previous studies have suggested that there are unequal horizontal stresses which are potentially due to tectonic effects. However, in some cases the magnitude of stress variation and reversal in stress-ordering across minor depths is problematic and confirms the pitfalls of oversimplified assumptions and models used in stress profiling in unconventional reservoirs. This work highlights the magnitude of stress variations within the formation and illustrates an integrated methodology to assist the decisions on selecting hydraulic fracture locations.|","Tight Gas, Hydraulic Fracturing, Geomechanics, Horizontal Wells, Petrophysical Rock Typing"

ZADCO's new field development program calls for drilling extended reach wells from artificial islands with the borehole kicking off at shallow depths and holding high inclination angles through the overburden. Previously, the development plan relied entirely on short reach, horizontal development wells drilled from jackup rigs with shallow overburden borehole sail angles rarely exceeding 30°. For both types of wells, bentonite weighted sea water is the preferred drilling fluid for the 16? or 17.5? diameter holes. Drilling problems that were managed in low-inclination wells became exacerbated at higher angles causing significant rig non-productive time (NPT). To improve our understanding of the shallow overburden formations, a comprehensive logging program was conducted in a key well drilled with a potassium chloride (KCl) mud system. Wireline borehole image, dipole shear sonic, spectroscopy and neutron-density-resistivity triple-combo logs were used to characterize the formations. 
A successful logging program relies on maintaining the borehole in good condition. In this case, the KCl mud in conjunction with good drilling practices kept the hole near the 16? bit gauge for 90% of the interval. Drilling mud losses were also minimized. The logging tools were successfully run to T.D. and the data acquired. The mineralogy of the penetrated formations was accurately quantified using spectroscopy tools. A high-resolution resistivity image log revealed that the entire interval was weakly fractured with a few zones of high secondary porosity and conductivity. These zones correlated well with zones of similar characteristics in offset wells. The key to drilling a high angle well lies is the geomechanical / geochemical characterization of the overburden formations to determine the wellbore failure mechanism(s). 
This paper highlights the benefits of a KCl mud in the top hole and the results of advanced logging covering the predominately shallow carbonate formations that exist above a large carbonate reservoir. It emphasizes the need for characterizing not only the reservoir but the overburden formations. This advances drilling engineers’ understanding of formation characteristics so that increased drilling sail angles could be achieved through the shallow overburden and thus successfully reach the reservoir targets.|","Logging, Instability, drilling, shallow, inhibitor"

Unconventional reservoirs in North America showed excellent results through the late decade. Tight carbonate and source rocks in the UAE with very low clay content involve more comparative challenges. Evaluation and application of Fracturing technology on these reservoirs require accurate designing, planning and execution. These three phases are followed by a unique strategy for cost optimization especially when oil price drops. 
To enable a detailed understanding of these formations and the applicable fracturing methodology, a complete study and strategic map is required. Unconventional reservoirs in North America have been studied extensively. The challenge is to adapt this technology locally to our tight reservoirs at ADCO-UAE. Creating a fracturing workflow and strategy that is applicable to the tight and unconventional formations in the UAE is the main target.

To evaluate the exploration potential of tight oil reservoirs in the Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation, a combined research was done to investigate the source rock distribution, diagensis, pore systems, petrophysical parameters. To begin with, the horizontal distribution and vertical thickness of the reservoir were clarified with data from well drilling and regional geological background. After that, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy experiments were conducted to study the pore types and morphologies. Then the pore size distribution was calculated based on mercury injection capillary pressure data. Finally, porosity and permeability were tested. Also, the causes of the tight sandstone, the controlling factor of petrophysical parameters and the fracability were discussed. 
The Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation is rich in tight oil reserves and shows good exploration potential. Horizontally, reservoir is accumulated at the centre of the lake deposit with an area of 7.5<U+00D7>103 km2; vertically, reservoir is in Chang 6, Chang 7 and Chang 8 member with total depth 25–80m, among which Chang 7 member acts as the main source rock. Sediments are mainly fine grained sand, cements including clays, calcite and dolomite. After early stage mechanical compaction and late stage cementation, the reservoir becomes quite tight. Pores are classified into four types, residual interparticle pores, intraparticle grain pores, clay dominated pores, and micro fractures. Residual interparticle pores and clay dominate pores are main pore types for storage and flow; existence of micro fracture can improve permeability and is a good indication of fracturing potential. Porosity is between 6.12–13.80% and air permeability normally smaller than 0.3 mD, the early stage compaction is the main reason of porosity reduction, while combination of compaction and cementation results in dramatic decreasing in permeability. This reservoir can be commercially developed with horizontal well and hydraulic fracturing stimulation. 
This study provides a workflow to fully characterize the storage and transport properties of a tight oil reservoir, and the workflow can act as reference to other similar reservoirs.|","tight oil reservoirs, pore structure"

Unconventional resources in Saudi Arabia symbolize an opportunity to extend required gas plateaus in the long term, to substitute gas for liquid fuels, and to provide potential feedstock for the growing chemical industry. This paper aims to outline an integrated completion engineering and geosciences approach that was applied in the Jafurah shale gas play. The goal was to address complex unconventional reservoirs and their associated challenges, and to determine the optimum completion and fracture design. 
Sweet spot identification within the Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation in the Jafurah basin represents a major challenge as it requires a large number of wells drilled over a wide geographical area with high associated costs. This requires innovative drilling, completion and stimulation practices. In order to identify and maximize potential frac stages and placements, a comprehensive study was completed using an advanced workflow encompassing drilling, geophysics, geomechanics, reservoir characterization, completion and fracturing and microseismic monitoring. 
The targeted Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain rocks are calcareous and interpreted to have been deposited in a restricted marine environment within an intra-shelf basin. This shale carbonate play shows a high Total Organic Content (TOC), low clay content, good matrix permeability, high gas saturation and high effective porosity. Scanning Electron microscope (SEM) images exhibit a dominant presence of organic porosity associated with the kerogen. Initial results from vertical wells drilled in the Jafurah basin proved that proppant fracturing can be successfully placed, and indicated the presence of a potential gas rich play within the same source rock. Subsequent horizontal wells were the first liquid rich/gas carbonate horizontal wells with ultra-low shale permeability in Saudi Arabia. The first horizontal wells had excellent gas production with significant amounts of condensate. 
By further building on experience from the drilled and stimulated wells, the lessons learned provide a foundation for the completion of future unconventional gas wells in the Jafurah basin.|","shale, resources, proppant, carbonate, unconventional"

In attempting to drill a deviated 12-1/4? 37° tanget section with WBM through the Laffan and Nahr Umr shale intervals, very little margin for error was faced in a well where failure was not an option. While problems in the Nahr Umr were to be expected, the instability of the Fiqa and Laffan shale layers became the catalyst for excessive non-productive time. Two lost holes preceded the successful completion of the section after taking the last resort step of a re-drill with Synthetic Oil Based Mud (SOBM). 
Various literature is available on wellbore stability problems in the Nahr Umr Formation on a regional and field specific scale. Behaviour of the shale and how best to control it is also known to vary on a field by field basis. Failure mechanisms are largely related to the mineralogical composition of the shale itself in combination with the localized geomechanical forces exerted on the specific wellbore. This paper captures the specific experience encountered in the operator's first well in the country and provides insight into the severity of the risk of wellbore instability. 
Numerous operational issues were encountered due to shale instability induced through drilling and tripping related mechanical forces. Before committing to the changeover to SOBM, exhaustive attempts were made to find an acceptable and workable compromise to the challenges faced while drilling the section with WBM. This included implementation of alternative methods of well construction including the use of innovative tools and hole enlargement to increase annular clearances with the BHA. Often it was observed that mitigation of one problem led to the onset of another problem. 
The experience is used to present an overview of the limitations of the contingency options available and the impact of unplanned changes implemented during the well construction phase. 
In addition to the engineering conclusions presented, the case study provides insight into the complexities of a start-up drilling operation. Where an entire field appraisal campaign depends on the successful accomplishment of primary objectives, the necessity to perservere through adversity becomes of yet higher importance.|","Best Practices, Well Design, Shale Stability, Deviated wellbore, Nahr Umr Laffan"

This paper compares rock physics trends in the Vp-vs.-Vs crossplot and the Vp/Vs-vs.-compressional slowness crossplot. Trend uncertainties are presented with laboratory data from the Bakken, Bazhenov, Monterey, and Niobrara shales; departures from expected trends attributed to kerogen, hydrocarbon, anisotropy, and well deviation are discussed. Anisotropy models, such as ANNIE (Schoenberg et al.1996), are presented for computing Thomsen parameters and stiffness coefficients. 
Castagna mudrock line (Castagna et al. 1993) derived from in-situ sonic and seismic measurements provided an average linear relationship between compressional and shear-wave velocities. Brie (1995) extended previous work to include predicting gas saturation from a Vp/Vs-vs.-compressional slowness crossplot. Projecting the Castagna mudrock line onto a shear-vs.-compressional slowness crossplot proved useful for interpreting sonic data. Classical-rock physics equations were used to model compressional and shear velocities as a function of well deviation. Laboratory anisotropy models allowed for characterizing the effects of dispersion, anisotropy, and well deviation. 
Anisotropic-rock physics models for the Bakken, Bazhenov, Monterey, and Niobrara organic shales are presented and compared in terms of the Thomsen parameters, e, ?, and d, and stiffness coefficients, Cij. These models are first transposed to trend curves in Vp-vs.-Vs, Vp/Vs-vs.-compressional slowness, and shear-vs.-compressional slowness crossplots and then compared to the Castagna mudrock trend curve. The anisotropy models are then applied to characterize the effect of well deviation on these trend curves. Results are also presented for well log data from the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, and Bakken formations in the context of the discussed crossplots and then compared with the expected trend curves. The Eagle Ford data satisfies the carbonate Vp-vs.-Vs trend predicted in previous literature by Castagna et al. (1993), and the Haynesville data clearly satisfies the gas effect predicted by the Brie Vp/Vs-vs.-compressional slowness crossplot discussed. 
In theory, the models describing anisotropy with the Thomsen parameters or stiffness coefficients are equivalent. In practice, not all the parameters for either model can be measured from log data. Preferentially, anisotropic models should be derived by combining log data from multiple vertical, deviated, and horizontal wells for each shale reservoir.|","rock physics, mud rock, Castagna, anisotropy, well deviation"

As the pioneer of shale gas exploration in China, Longmaxi formation that located in the lower Silurian system in Sichuan basin has entered the developing phase. Under the geological background, seismic and multi-exploration wells’ data analysis, it has been proven that the shale gas play in Longmaxi is more complex than it's equivalents in North America. Though the deeper burying depth of Longmaxi has bring extra bonus by higher pore pressure (1.7 to 2.0), Longmaxi is lagging back in some key reservoir quality indicators such as kerogen content and porosity, same time, the compressional tectonic setting and relative active plate movement develop faults and fractures in an unpredictable way brings extra challenge. Driven by the complexity, more and more technologies have been deployed in the development phase to better define the play. Among them, well placement with real-time image, LWD or wireline logging for reservoir quality (RQ) and completion quality (CQ) evaluation and engineering optimized completion design have been recognized as critical steps in better understand shale gas production based on abroad experience. Although it's always appealing to run the integrated methodology with multi-source data for each horizontal well, the tight economic return is preventing field wide implementation. 
This paper studies multi-well data from an integrated project with PetroChina ZheJiang in Zhao Tong block; examines data acquired from 3 laterals drilled in the same direction in the same pad but utilized different combination of technologies including well placement with real-time image, LWD quad-combo logging with spectroscopy and engineering optimized fracture design. By investigating the micro seismic data and production rate from each lateral, correlation were made to identify the key production drivers and finally lead to the conclusion of the most economic and efficiency technology combination for the horizontal wells development pattern in Sichuan Basin. 
In conclusion, laterally the heterogeneity of reservoir quality for the same layer in the target platform is not the key production driver. However, reservoir quality and three principal stresses along vertical scope, combining with the nature fracture distribution make a big difference for the completion fracture extension and production rate. As a result, well placement with bedding identification ability being a prevention methodology is quite critical in the mountainous area in Sichuan basin. LWD logging and an engineering optimal completion design based on that provide comprehensive understanding for each lateral should be deployed based on several considerations including well trajectory, heterogeneity, etc.

Fracture models are derived using geologic and geophysical information, as well as mechanical properties. Hydraulic fractures are then simulated and recreate realistic mechanical results. Products of the workflow such as local stress anisotropy and rotations, strain distributions, and the J Integral provide insight into the sometimes unexpected results of fracing efforts, from the standpoint of geomechanics and the impact of natural fracture networks. Considered primarily in this study is the impact of large scale faults on various stages of an unconventional resource's development. 
First, in a Wolfcamp study, it is demonstrated that the mechanical activation of a fault known to bring water can be mitigated either by moving the well 640ft further from the fault and accepting an engineered completion which omits two stages still likely to access the fault, or by moving the well over 920 ft to complete the entire length of the well without accessing the fault. A dataset from the Eagle Ford is then used to demonstrate the ability of the workflow to predict 90 degree stress rotations in fault blocks crossed by a well, and suggests how higher stress anisotropies might reduce the ability of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate complex permeability and instead, only access preexisting fractures. Finally, using recently published fault data and seismic data from the Oklahoma Geological Survey, the link between induced seismic events and a geomechanical proxy are explored. 
From well placement in relation to a fault, to stage placement in a well which crosses a fault block with a pronounced stress rotation, to prediction of induced seismic events across three Oklahoma counties—the potential of this workflow to address numerous shale concerns is demonstrated. Large scale faults can greatly alter the stress fields, and consequently the potential of a resource-rich rock to be stimulated. These effects are quantified using geomechanical products of the workflow such as stress anisotropy distributions, strain distributions, and the J Integral. The 3G workflow considered here produces multiple geomechanical results which are crucial to a more realistic understanding of how hydraulic fracturing efforts stimulate the reservoir.|","microseismic predictions, J integral correlation with fracture density, frac stage optimization, fracing near faults, interaction natural & hydraulic fractures"

Geomechanical modeling is important to understand in-situ stresses, reservoir stress path, stress contrast, wellbore stability, solid production, integrity of cap-rock and drilling vertical and horizontal wells. The knowledge of the in-situ stresses is critical for pre-drill and post-drill well planning as well as wellbore stability prediction and is needed throughout the life of a well. The uncertainty associated with this geomechanical modeling can be critical and costly if these uncertainties are not mitigated and, to reduce this uncertainty, it is important to have a calibrated geomechanical model. One important technology that can help with reducing the uncertainty is the wireline straddle-packer microfrac tests for in-situ stress characterization. It is an important technology that helps in the measurement of in-situ formation breakdown pressure, fracture propagation pressure and fracture closure pressure. It also helps with other important hydraulic fracturing design such as fracture containment assessment, horizontal stress profile and stress contrast to stimulate tight formation shale gas or oil, water disposal wells and for OBM cutting reinjection wells. 
The microfrac testing procedure uses the pressure response measured during formation breakdown, fracture propagation, fracture reopening cycles and pressure fall-off cycles for overall stress measurement and fracture closure identification. The objective of this microfrac testing was to validate and calibrate the horizontal stress profile in various intervals of the target formations. This paper focuses on the microfrac testing methodology, the geomechanical principles governing the testing, the resulting interpretation and the geomechanical modeling for horizontal stress calibration in a vertical borehole onshore Abu Dhabi.|","Straddle Packer, MicroFrac"

In the context of multi-stage hydraulically fractured horizontal wells, unstructured grids such as PEBI (perpendicular bisector) grids or Voronoi grids have been widely applied to generate simulation meshes for fracture networks. In previous work we developed a robust optimization-based 2D meshing algorithms to handle non-orthogonal, low-angle intersections of extensively-clustered fractures with non-uniform aperture distributions. However, vertically extruded 2.5D PEBI grids become necessary with more wells being drilled into dipping layers. Besides, it is necessary to provide practical application suggestions for choosing an unstructured mesh to accurately resolve flow regimes of production. 
In this work we extended 2D PEBI workflow to 2.5D, and then validated it against two models: (a) a synthetic model with one horizontal well and 120 orthogonal intersected hydraulic fractures built by Tar-tan grid and (b) a field-scale model with three horizontal wells and 120 non-orthogonal intersected hydraulic fractures in a slightly dipping reservoir created by a commercial software plug-in. For the synthetic model, we simulated production performance at a constant bottom-hole flowing pressure up to 20 years. For the field-scale model, we first performed history matching and then predicted production at a constant rate up to 20 years. We compared pressure diffusion front, bottom-hole flowing pressure as well as CPU performance. 
Reasonably good matches between PEBI grids and other grids are observed in both pressure diffusion front and production behavior. Sensitivity analysis suggests that refinement around the fractures has modest impact to early time production while background density has dominant impact to the late time production. Background grid type and grid orientation have less influence as long as they have the same grid density. Less number of 2.5D PEBI cells can be achieved by removing unnecessary refinement around fractures, increasing reservoir background size and reservoir background size ratio, replacing unstructured background grids with structured grids, and reducing the complexity of the fracture networks without loss of the accuracy and therefore result in much favorable CPU performance. The existence of opened natural fractures was evaluated to simulate the out-of-zone production. The results suggest that effective drainage area can be significantly greater with the synergy of the natural fractures. 
This study is the first to apply unstructured grids to simulate multiple horizontal wells with irregular hydraulic fractures. Besides, this paper provides detailed discussions of implementation algorithms as well as comparisons between 2.5D PEBI and LGR based grids in the context of fracture modeling. And most importantly, this study answers the question regarding how to choose an appropriate 2.5D PEBI mesh to yield both accurate results and good CPU performance.|","Unconventional Resources, Reservoir Simulation, Unstructured Grid, Fracture Characterisation and Modelling, Field Cases"

Recent trends in petroleum production have focused on developing unconventional gas reservoirs such as tight gas and shale gas. Considering worldwide shale gas resource potential, the largest resources exist in the former USSR and in North America, while for China, Central and Southeast Asia the estimated shale gas resource is 1115 TCF. Despite the smaller resource projection, this unconventional resource is of great interest for future development. In Thailand, the primary energy source is oil and natural gas, with 77% of electricity generated from natural gas (EIA, 2011). Yet current production is not enough to support the growing energy demand in Thailand, and there is increasing emphasis in exploring potential unconventional resources to meet this demand. 
A study has been conducted to improve reservoir knowledge of the Huai Hin Lat formation, believed to be an important source rock for the gas fields in northeast Thailand. The Huai Hin Lat formation consists of fluvio-lacustrine sediments of Late Triassic. The formation is exposed along the margin of the Khorat Plateau. Petroleum exploration in Khorat Plateau has been ongoing since 1962 and two gas fields have been discovered and commercially produced in the Khorat Plateau since 1988. 
Seven shale samples were taken from the Huai Hin Lat formation. All samples are the organic rich fine-grained rocks. The MicroCT technique was measured for porosity parameter. The average porosity of the samples was approximately 4.9%, and a pore size distribution was found. In addition, geochemical analysis was performed to determine total organic content (TOC) of the shale samples. The average TOC was found to be approximately 4.9%. 
Permeability was measured for the seven samples using transient pressure pulse decay. The permeability range of the samples was found to be 90 (D to 280 (D and the average permeability of sample was approximately 180 (D. Permeability varies significantly because the shale is somewhat heterogeneous. Natural fractures present in the formation may also affect the value of effective permeability. 
This paper provides details regarding the analysis of the Huai Hin Lat samples and the shale's rock properties as they relate to other commercial unconventional gas resources. The work is significant because there are few existing petrophysical evaluations of this formation. Results from this study will identify and highlight key reservoir parameters necessary to further assess the commercial potential of the Huai Hin Lat shale as a shale gas reservoir.|","Transient Pressure Pulse Decay, Shale Gas Unconventional Resource, Huai Hin Lat Formation, Thailand, Permeability Meausement"

This paper is focused on the integration of two laboratory centimeter-resolution logs of mechanical properties (strength and compressional elastic-wave velocity Vp) into an enhanced core analysis workflow for the geomechanical characterization of unconventional reservoirs in a giant field in Abu Dhabi, where fracking is the cornerstone for producing the unconventional oil. The design and placement of hydraulic fratures rely strongly on the a-priori knowledge of the stress profile and brittleness index, which were estimated via a mechanical earth model constructed from wireline logs and correlations based on US shales analogues. With most of the stratigraphic column in the Abu Dhabi field composed of carbonates, the calibration of the mechanical earth models was found critical as the US shales based correlations would otherwise not have been suitable to the geomechanical characterization of these tight carbonate reservoirs. 
With this case study we illustrate: 
How the combination of the continuous profiles of rock strength UCS (Uniaxial compressive strength) and P-wave velocity measured directly on dry cores with the scratch tests contributes to the identification of different Geomechanical Facies, 
How the mapping of several Geomechanical Facies enables the building of a simple yet robust relationship between the UCS measured directly on cores and properties such as the total porosity and acoustic velocities of sonic waves, obtained from wireline logs, and 
How the centimeter-resolution profiles of strength and elastic wave velocities measured on dry cores enable the proper upscaling of geomechanical properties measured on plug samples to the entire cored section and the computation of a horizontal stress and brittleness profiles derived from unbiased geomechanical properties. |From this case study follows a general discussion on the relevance of wireline sonic logs relative to centimetric resolution data (scratch profiles or plug measurement) acquired on dry cores for the geomechanical characterization of reservoirs. We conclude that measurements on dry cores enable the more robust calibration of mechanical earth model and in turn better description of the reservoir mechanical response. The upscaled profiles of horizontal stress and brittleness index derived from dry core measurements would ultimately lead to an alternative strategy for the design and placement of hydraulic fractures along producing wells.|","Scratch test strength, Mechanical rock properties prediction, Core analysis, Core based ultrasonic profile, Geomechanical facies"

The deep high pressure/high temperature (HPHT) dolomite formation in Northern Kuwait has been a challenge with varied production, attributable to reservoir heterogeneity. Due to the tight nature of these rocks, matrix acidizing may not produce desired effects, thus requiring hydraulic fracturing to produce at economic rates. However, the tectonic setting in high stress environment has resulted in subpar success and inconsistent results from stimulation treatments in matrix and hydraulic fracturing applications. 
This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to address the limited success in the Northern Kuwait Dolomites. An integrated petrophysical evaluation of the current wells will be followed with multi-well Heterogeneous Rock Analysis (HRA), to evaluate the reservoir heterogeneity across the field and identify the ‘sweet spots’ for future drilling locations. Evaluation and lessons learnt from the past stimulation treatments, will be used to understand geo-mechanical challenges and to help calibrate the Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) for implementation in the future wells. Finally, using a reservoir-centric stimulation design tool, stimulation type (acid fracturing vs proppant fracturing) and stimulation design optimization for future wells will be developed. 
A reservoir-level petrophysical evaluation of the existing wells was performed and compared to understand the reservoir heterogeneity vis. a vis. production potential. Multiple rock classes were identified within the tight dolomite interval, with a gross thickness of ~250 ft. Starting with log based MEM, results from the image log interpretation and the field observations/measurements from fracture diagnostic tests (Decline analysis, Calibration injection) were used in calibrating the MEM and mapping the Completion Quality (CQ) heterogeneity across the field. This has led to a reservoir-level understanding, which can enable planning optimal well locations, target interval and subsequent well placement/completions methodology. Finally, using the reservoir-centric design tool, an optimum design to effectively stimulate the ultralow-permeability dolomites was determined. The optimization workflow did not only include a single-faceted approach of fracture modeling, but also encompassed a production forecast using the integrated numerical reservoir simulator. Lessons learnt from the optimization workflow were further extended to designing horizontal wells (landing point, trajectory for optimal stimulation geometry), and hence to aid in field development strategy. 
Using the multidisciplinary unconventional workflow, the heterogeneity in reservoir quality and completion quality was evaluated, both along the wellbore and spatially. In essence, we found that natural fractures along with high Critical Net Pay (CNP) allows you to vertically connect with good RQ and thus, is required for success in these tight reservoirs. Following which, reservoir-centric stimulation design tool enabled optimization of completion and stimulation design in a holistic approach, to maximize appraisal and production opportunities.|","low permeability, fracturing, unconventional, hpht, dolomite"

Brittleness indices (BI) commonly used in the petroleum industry are based on elastic modulus or mineralogy that can be calculated from well logs. However, they both ignore the effect of confining pressure. Shale is usually distributed at different depth under different confining pressure. Models without considering the influence of confining pressure will directly lead to inaccuracy in BI calculation, thus resulting in the failure of hydraulic fracturing. In this work, we compared confining pressure with rock mechanics parameters and the microcrack quantity of a core, introduced ""fracture toughness"" to explain how confining pressure influences BI, and finally developed a new model to correct the effect of confining pressure in BI calculation. Fracture toughness is an important parameter that characterizing a rock’s resistance to a fracture. It increases with confining pressure, since an increase of confining pressure may close preexisting cracks and restrict the crack propagation. The results show that BI is usually larger at low confining pressure than at high pressure. Also, higher content in brittle mineral does not necessarily mean brittler. The results calculated by the new model, which considers the influence of Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, tensile strength, confining pressure and fracture toughness in BI calculation, match well with experimental results.|","Fracture toughness, Poisson's ratio, Confining pressure, Brittleness index, Youngaˆ™s modulus"

Reservoir performance in tight sandstone is influenced by geomechanical behavior of natural fractures profoundly. Keshen gas field, located in Kuqa Depression of Tarim Basin, northwest China, and the pay zone is naturally fractured sandstone undergone strong tectonic activities of squeezing and thrusting. To understand key factors to productivity in this reservoir, an analysis of geomechanical response of natural fractures was presented that elaborated the relationship between productivity and geomechanical characteristics of fractured tight gas reservoir. 
To evaluate the geomechanical response of natural fractures quantitatively, a comprehensive laboratory testing program (covering more than 130 core samples from 7 wells) was performed, 1D geomechanical model was built for 23wells which described distribution of the mechanical properties and in situ stress in Keshen reservoir. The normal stress and shear stress of each fracture plane were calculated to compare the relative mechanical response of natural fractures across the anticline structure. We then simulated mechanical response of natural fractures under different pore pressure according to Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, and obtained the correlation between geomechanical response and open-flow potential of wells. 
The results illustrated that well productivity in Keshen reservoir was closely related to the geomechanical response of natural fractures. At the crest of structure and faulting area, the favorable combination of in situ stress and natural fracture strike resulted in high shear-to-normal stress ratio and high fracture conductivity. On the other hand, at the saddle and flanks of this structure, the ratios were lower and so did for well conductivity. The difference of well productivity for the two cases could be up to forty times. And simulation under different pore pressure showed that the proportion of natural fractures reaching critical stress state in the wellbore affected the flow potential directly. In other words, some wells developed natural fractures with strong shear deformation potential corresponding to a high productivity. And then with the depletion, the dynamic change of mechanical response of natural fractures was also closely related to productivity. Taking 3 new wells for example, as pore pressure of reservoir decreased by 10MPa, productivity of 2 wells dropped since the shear-to-normal stress ratio of 70% natural fractures reduced, their productivity was lower than adjacent wells even after fracturing. The productivity of the third well maintained high because the shear-to-normal stress ratio of all natural fractures increased. 
It was revealed that the geomechanical response of natural fractures was a controlling factor of well productivity in Keshen tight sandstone gas reservoir. The information obtained from this study provided critical input for reservoir stimulation and development for the gas field.|","Geomechanical Response, Productivity, Natural Fractures, Tight Sandstone, Tarim Basin"

Multistage fracturing technique has considerably improved gas production from tight gas reservoirs all over the world. Well production is one of the main determining factors to assess the success of a fracturing treatment. In this paper, numerous vertical and horizontal wells drilled in the high pressure high temperature heterogeneous reservoirs have been evaluated to confirm effectiveness of stimulation treatments and benefits derived from the use of novel technologies. Among many variables that were analyzed include drilling, completion, and stimulation parameters such as well azimuth, completion types, fluid characteristics, acid strength, etc. 
A database for stimulated wells was created and various parameters have been grouped and assessed to provide correlation and understand the effectiveness of fracture treatments and optimize development plan. Correlations were drawn using the Pearson correlation coefficient equation to compute data trend and ensure good quality data. Numerous, very useful plots are constructed and presented that show the different trends of the variables evaluated and how they affect production rate. 
Analyses results indicate that use of real-time geomechanics is important to predict reservoir pressure and mud weight as wells are laterally drilled in the preferred minimum in-situ stress (smin) direction. This is because when wells are drilled along smin, they tend to become more unstable due to the higher stress acting on the wellbore. Accuracy in predicting stresses and pressures are keys to the drilling of such wells. The completion assemblies were selected between open hole multistage and plug and perforation cased hole approaches based of reservoir properties and hole conditions. The impact on production performance by using of non-damaging low gel loading fracturing fluids, high strength proppants, and optimal fluid and acid volumes have been demonstrated using actual field examples. The paper also illustrates the use of novel fracturing approach such as channel fracturing and its impact on sustained gas production in tight gas and making low productivity wells commercial.|","multistage, stimulation, carbonates, fracturing"

Because fracture gradient changes with rock type, some formations are more sensitive to induced fractures than others. Depending upon depth, the fractures created will either be horizontal or vertical. If the depth is 2500 feet or less, horizontal fractures are usually produced. Because horizontal fractures require lifting the entire overburden, they are limited to shallow depths. At depths over 3500 feet, fractures are usually vertical. Because vertical fractures occur without lifting the overburden, they can be created at much lower pressure. The propagation pressure is generally much less than the pressure that would be required to initiate the fracture. Consequently, fracture losses, once initiated, are difficult to control. 
Wellbore instability, particularly in shale formations, is a major challenge in drilling operations. Many factors such as rock properties, in-situ stresses, chemical interactions between shale and drilling fluids, and thermal effects must be taken into consideration in well trajectory designs and drilling fluid formulations to mitigate wellbore instability-related problems. 
The Steerable Drilling Liner service combines a rotary steerable system with a liner to help overcome the challenges: drilling in zones with lower pressure and unstable shale/coal layers, and with formations of varying flow and pressure regimes. Running the liner while drilling keeps the wellbore stable and eliminates the need to pull the drillstring to run casing. This is how it reduces your risks and NPT, saving the costs associated with contingency plans. Because the liner is isolated from the reamer shoe, you can rotate the liner at much lower RPMs than the pilot and reamer bits. This design lessens the load on the liner, improving its fatigue life. 
The Steerable Drilling Liner steerable drilling liner service helps you to mitigate the risk of hole collapse and formation damage by reducing openhole exposure, Reduce NPT by eliminating extra trips and ensuring that the liner is installed at TD from the first run 
Enhance wellbore integrity by drilling with the liner, leading to the plastering effect, which reduces fluid loss and cuttings volume, Lower health, safety, and environmental (HSE) risks by reducing pipe handling and rigsite footprint size

A large, strategically important unconventional (tight) gas project in the Sultanate of Oman advanced from the exploration stage with one discovery well to the pilot and development stages over 4 years. Project challenges in the first 2 years of exploration were poor initial success in both fracturing treatment placement and subsequent productivity and an ever-expanding scope of work in a demanding environment with limited resources. To address these challenges, the focus was shifted from routine delivery to an integrated approach and a strategy that included defined activity timelines, key performance indicators aligning with different stakeholders, and process reviews. Technology deployment and improved operations with allocated fracturing equipment spread gave flexibility to this new efficiency model. Integrated technology trials included cased and openhole completions; different well types; and several rock and core mechanical tests, such as reservoir coring, openhole stress testing, sonic measurements, and continuous unconfined compressive strength measurements. It also incorporated abrasive perforating, various fracturing treatment type designs, and advanced evaluation techniques such as microseismic monitoring, three-phase flow metering, tracers, and others. These technologies were implemented in a fast and efficient manner owing to strong collaboration between a dedicated Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) subsurface team and the service provider expertise. Personnel embedded in the exploration team greatly helped with linking to proper resources within the suppliers. An embedded engineer provided immediate technical and logistical support to the team. The improved process involved multiwell fracturing, a test campaign, and evaluation of individual zones. Finally, gaps and areas for improvement going forward were identified. Over the 4 years, with implementation of the new technology and strategy, the success rate of fracture placement and zonal evaluation increased from the low initial success of less than 50% to 100%; the improvement was particularly evident in the extremely tight lower intervals of the reservoir.|","tight, unconventional, exploration, collaboration, oman"

Microseismic data is evaluated with surface seismic and analyzed in addition to treatment data to understand the variance in performance of frac stages at three wells drilled in the Longmaxi formation, China. In well H1, the microseismic is dominated by fault reactivations, and is of little use in analyzing the performance of individual frac stages. In the wells H2 and H3, the use of maximum curvature derived from surface seismic showed strong qualitative correlation with microseismicity. To quantify the effects of shale properties on the frac stage performances, seismic attributes were used to derive geologic models of porosity, total gas, fracture density and Poisson's Ratio which were combined to form the Shale Capacity. The comparison of the Shale Capacity with the production log of H1 demonstarates how the model explains the performance of the frac stages away from the faults. The same observations could be made using the extent of good Shale Capacity away from the faults to explain the important difference in production between H2 and H3. Given the importance of the faults and their geomechanical impact on the performance of the frac stages, a geomechanical workflow able to simulate the interaction between the hydraulic and natural fractures is applied to the H1 well. The resulting strain and J Integral are able to explain the performance of the frac stages in H1 thus confirming the importance of the natural fractures and the need to account for their geomechanical effects.|","shale gas in China, 3G workflow, frac stage optimization, shale capacity, sweet spot identification"

The main objective of this paper to is to discuss the recent finding on the formation anisotropy and lateral heterogeneity in the different hydrocarbon fields of onshore Abu Dhabi. The study was focused on Thamama and Wasia groups, mainly related anisotropy and spatial heterogeneity of the geomechanical poperties for reservoir characterization. This would have an impact on the stress variation and the definition of potential ""sweet spots"" for well placement optimization and identification of suitable completion methods. 
The 1D Mechanical Earth model (MEM) is a description and quantification of rock elastic and strength properties, in-situ stresses and pore pressure as a function of depth, referenced to a stratigraphic column. The available wireline logs of several existing wells, including the compressional and shear slowness, stonely, bulk density, and gamma ray were used to compute log-derived elastic parameters, strength properties and stress components. Rock mechanics laboratory core plug tests were performed to calibrate the log-derived mechanical properties. Anisotropic modelling was applied to understand the anisotropy in elastic properties and horizontal stresses. 
Integrating the 1D-MEMs indicate that Onshore Abu Dhabi Geomechanical properties (elastic and strength) and in-situ stresses vary laterally and vertically. Further, several mechanical layering and horizontal stress anisotropy can be identified. These results imply that the Wasia and Thamama reservoirs are susceptible to different fracturing mechanisms. Hence different fracture and faults sets can be predicted within the highly anisotropic deformation zones. 
These findings significantly impact the exploration play concepts, where lateral variations are anticipated.

Matrix permeability could be a key factor controlling shale gas production from matrix to micro fractures and further to hydraulic fractures in Chinese shales due to the low porosity and permeability, affected by its unique geochemistry and geology settings including the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content, mineral compositions, pore structure, and deposition environment. This paper aims to study the controlling factors of the matrix permeability in the continental shale formation, Ordos, China, through modified laboratory measurement mothod. 
In this work, nine shale samples were collected from three wells in Chang 7 member, Yanchang continental formation, Ordos Basin, China, crushed at in-situ water saturation and sieved to certain size (20/40 mesh). Matrix permeability of these samples was measured with modified Pressure-decay method and compard with the results with Pulse-decay method. The reasons for the discrepancy of these results with different methods were analysed. Moreover, the effects of geochemistry and geology factors on matrix permeability were investigated by grouping these crushed samples according to the variation of TOC, mineral compositions and deposition depth. The relationships between shale matrix permeability and TOC as well as depth were established respectively. Furthermore, the effects of other factors such as mineralogical compositions and pore structure parameters were studied through the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. 
The results show that the shale matrix permeability measured by the Pulse-decay method is generally up to two orders of magnitude higher than that by the Pressure-decay method due to the presence of the natural or artificial micro fractures. In addition, the geochemistry and geology parameters including the TOC, mineral compositions, pore structure and deposition environment have significant effects on the shale matrix permeability. Matrix permeability in Yanchang shale formation is strongly related to TOC and the mineral compositionand even at the similar depth, porosity and matrix permeability are different due to the variation of TOC as a result of geological heterogeanity. TOC in Yanchang formation varies considerably in the range of 1.8 wt % to over 11 wt %, resulting in significant changes in matrix permeability ranging from 0.02 nD to 10 nD, resulting from the influence of the organic matter and clay minerals on total pore volume based on the result of SEM and XRD analysis. The accurate measurement of matrix permeability is important for computer simulation modeling of long term shale gas production.|","Ordos Basin, China, Continental shale, Matrix permeability, Controlling factors, Experimental study"

Failure planes and tensile fracture initiation in the micro-beam were associated with the various phases of the mineral and organic cluster components. |The micro-beam tests of this composite natural material demonstrate linear elastic behavior followed by plastic yielding before complete failure. This behavior was clearly observed to correlate with the amount of organic matter at the fractured surface. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were conducted at the post-failure stage on the resulting fracture faces and the relationship between mechanical behavior and composition was established. It was observed that when high mineral content was found at the faces, a brittle failure took place, while when the fixed support had high kerogen content the micro-beam failed in a ductile mode. |These results reinforce our growing understanding of the heterogeneous nature of shale and the importance of nano- and micro-scale analyses to understand our reservoir source rocks.|","Young's Modulus, organic rich shale, tensile failure, failure mechanics, geomechanics of micro-beams and micro-pillars"

Shale gas development by hydraulic fracturing in Southern China highlights the features of high fracture pressure and of serious difficulties in proppant placement due to deep burial (over 4000 m). This scenario differs from that in North America. 
To solve the problems described above, conventional triaxial tests were conducted on the properties of rock mechanics under a simulated high temperature and high pressure reservoir environment. A full-size 3-D finite element method (FEM) is used to predict the fracture pressure of deep shale formation, taking both the rock deformation behavior of ultra-deep shale and the influence of fracturing fluid filtration into account. Effective engineering approaches are also presented that focus on reducing the friction of fracturing fluid and on the efficiency of acid pretreatment. 
The triaxial compressive test results indicate that under the condition of high temperature and increasing confining pressure, the plasticity of the rock is strengthened and the nonlinear characteristic will inhibit fracture initiation. The correctness and reliability of the FEM model are confirmed through a comparison of the FEM model calculation result with the field data. Moreover, preliminary proposals are made for perforation parameter optimization based on this model. An optimal perforation phase angle of 60° and a perforation density of 18 perforations/m are considered appropriate parameters. A long perforation tunnel (more than 1 m) mitigates the state that the majority of the perforation component endures pressure stress. Finally, both laboratory test and field application results show that a refined slick water system design can generate a friction reducing rate of no less than 75% and that a new acid system can lower pressure by 10–15 MPa before fracturing. As a result, fracture pressure is reduced. 
This work presents a method of addressing the challenges arising from the abnormal hydraulic fracture pressure on ultra-deep shale, including the causes determined during laboratory tests and the treatments generalized from FEM results and engineering approaches. These solutions are a necessary step toward reducing fracture pressure in deep shale gas development.|","nonlinear behavior, engineering approaches, ultra-deep shale, fracture pressure, finite element method"

The application of a new Material Point Method (MPM) approach to model the proppant distribution in a reservoir where hydraulic fractures interact with natural fractures is presented and validated with an Eagle Ford well. The new MPM approach uses particles to represent the slurry and its effects on the hydraulic and natural fractures. The particles are injected in the hydraulic fractures and their action causes the hydraulic fractures to propagate and interact with the natural fractures thus providing new pathways for the proppant to move away from the wellbore when optimal natural fracture orientations are encountered. Elementary tests showed that long fractures oriented in 30 and 60 degree from the hydraulic fracture directions facilitate the proppant placement. However, the stress anisotropy seems to have little effects for fractures oriented in 30 and 60 degree but allows a better proppant placement for fracture oriented 90 degrees from the hydraulic fracture. The application of the new technology to an entire Eagle Ford well shows that the simulated proppant indicates a large propped volume towards the heel and a poor proppant placement at the toe stages as indicated by other methods. These field validated results, show that the macroscopic modeling of proppant distribution using the coupled solid/fluid MPM technology could be used in improving our understanding of the complex hydraulic fracturing process and the resulting proppant distribution that provide the needed initial stimulated permeability.|","propped volume, hydraulic & natural fractures interaction, SRV, geomechanical modeling, Material Point Method (MPM)"

The complex jungle of wells and horizontal laterals under the surface of the earth has raised the complexity of pad optimization and hydraulic fracturing to a next level. Modeling the hydraulic fracture systems correctly is key for optimizing well and stage locations. Even in the case of noncomplex, planar fractures, the interaction amongst the fractures, which is also known as stress shadow effect, can lead to uneven fracture growth. In the case of complex fracture networks, the fracture interaction can be even stronger due to typically higher fracture density. Therefore, stress shadowing is a key element in reservoir modeling for shale plays in the framework of hydraulic fracturing. The sequence of stage placement in the pad and their treatment can also have a significant impact on the reservoir contact. |The zipper fracturing technique, involving the simultaneous and back-to-back stimulation of horizontal wells on a pad, has been rapidly adopted by multiple operators in the last few year across various shale plays in North America. The technique has achieved its popularity due to increased efficiency and reduced turnaround time for a multiwell pad. The method has been effective in saving tens of millions of dollars for operators by accelerating the pad development cycle. Apart from improved completion efficiency, pads that have run zipper fracturing have shown improved production from their counterparts in the same field that have been completed without zipper fracturing. The impact on hydraulic fracture growth due to stress shadow from offset wells’ hydraulic fracture systems is a major contributing factor for this difference. Depending on the time spent between the stages, the extent and magnitude of stress shadow will change to dictate the growth of the offset well hydraulic fracture stage. |Proper reservoir modeling can help optimize the well location and spacing, completion staging, and optimizing hydraulic fracture treatment designs as well as their sequence. This study reviews and discusses the application of stress shadow modeling for various treatment sequences for multiple wells in a pad—and use of numerical reservoir simulation for optimal pad development strategy. The results assess the impact of managing the fracturing sequence and accounting for the delay in time between stages, growth of hydraulic fractures and their interference amongst each other, distribution of proppants and fluids, and reservoir drainage through numerical simulation for unconventional reservoirs.|","UFM, Hydraulic Fracturing, Stress Shadow, Zipper Fracturing, Unconventional Reservoir"

The physical model and experimental data support the beneficial technology of graded proppant injection into naturally fractured reservoirs to stimulate natural fracture permeability. Injection of particles with increasing size, at poroelastic and hydraulic fracturing conditions, yield deeper penetration and gradual filling of natural fractures with a resulting increase in permeability. This work expands on the concepts and outlines steps to maximize the benefit of graded proppant injection to enhance coal seam gas stimulation by focusing on the effect of the chemistry of injected fluid on the overall performance and the use in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing. 
Low productivity indices can be observed in many moderate- to low-permeability coal bed methane (CSG) reservoirs due to low aperture and poor connectivity of natural cleats. Graded proppant injection in CSG environments can: stimulate a stress sensitive cleat system below the fracturing pressure as well as enhance a fracturing treatment by invading cleats, lowering fluid leakoff, and maintaining aperture during production. Further, periodic or remedial treatments could to counter effective stress on the cleats improving production by maintaining cleat aperture. 
Laboratory tests on coal core flooding by water under increasing pore pressure with proppant injection at the maximum pressure have been carried out under different salinities of the injected water. Proppant-proppant and proppant-coal Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) total interaction energies were calculated to optimise the condition for successful proppant placement. Results on the DLVO total energy of interaction showed that conditions favourable for successful proppant placement in coal cleats are suspension ionic strengths between 0.05 M and 0.1 M NaCl. At these conditions no proppant agglomeration and proppant-coal attachment are observed, allowing deeper penetration of proppant into the natural coal cleat system. Lower suspension ionic strengths can lead to natural coal fines migration, cleat plugging and coal permeability reduction. 
Based on the experimental results and previously developed model a case study has been conducted to evaluate the productivity enhancement using this technique. The results show about four-fold increase in well productivity index at injections below fracturing pressures and may further improve the stimulated reservoir volume when used in conjunction with low permeability coal hydraulic fracturing treatments.|","productivity enhancement, natural fracture stimulation, coal seam gas, graded proppant injection"

The North Kuwait Carbonate Reservoirs (NKCR) are currently under development by KOC (Kuwait Oil Company). The appraisal and development of the NKCR offer challenges such as lateral variations in reservoir quality, tight to very tight reservoirs and natural fractures with a high degree of spatial variations. The presence of open, connected fractures is one of the key elements to achieve a successful development. Also, the presence of fracture corridors increases the risk associated with drilling. Numerous fracture modelling studies have been supporting both appraisal and development strategies of the fields. 
This paper illustrates how small sector scale detailed DFN (Discrete Fracture Network) can support the planning and drilling activities of future appraisal wells. 
A series of detailed DFN models has been built around existing wells. These DFN models are based on a thorough structural understanding combined with a detailed fracture characterisation using bore-hole image (BHI) and core data around the wells of interests. In addition to the fracture characterization work, mechanical stratigraphy has been developed using E-facies and geomechanical logs. Fracture connectivity analysis has been carried out to calibrate the DFNs to the static and dynamic well data. DFN models have also been created around appraisal well locations based on the calibration with the existing wells. These DFN models are now being used to communicate with drilling in order to illustrate the potential distribution of fracture corridors in the sub-surface. These DFN models are also helping to improve the placement of the planned wells with respect to their associated risks and objectives.|","Well planning, Fracture modelling, Fracture characterisation, DFN, Fracture corridor"

Maintaining wellbore stable is one of the key tasks in the oil and gas industry, in order to reduce nonproductive time during drilling, because wellbore instability problems would lead to higher than necessary drilling costs and have a severe impact on drilling schedule. Wellbore stability is controlled by two type of factors, one type is the factors which are completely out of our control, such as in-situ stresses, pore pressure, and rock strength, the other type is the factors which we can optimize and design to minimize geomechanical related stability problems, such as well trajectory, casing seats, mud system, mud weight, and proper drilling practice including minimizing swab and surge while running pipe and reducing the stationary time during connection. 
In this paper, only the mud weight optimization and casing seats design will be focused on, in order to avoid geomechanical related instability issues for drilling a recently planned appraisal well in an offshore field. 
Mechanical properties including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, USC, friction angle, tensile strength, bulk density and pore pressure gradient obtained from two offset wells A1 and A2 were projected to the planned appraisal well A3 with tops were used as guidance. The same parameters optimized from those two offset wells were used to estimate horizontal stresses for the planned well, and the same failure criterion was used to carry out wellbore stability for the planned well. Meanwhile the mud weight corresponding to kick, breakout, loses and breakdown were obtained. Based on those results, the safe mud weight window was established and the casing seats were placed to prevent and reduce the geomechanics related instability problems. 
This methodology allows us to predict and prevent the geomechanics related instability issues in advance before drilling starts, thereby to reduce the non-productive time and drilling costs. Continuous updating of the geomechanical model is necessary during drilling if the geological environment is complicated.|","Wellbore, Stability, Optimization, Weight, Mud"

In an effort to improve hydrocarbon recovery in unconventional formations, a new stimulation method was developed to take advantage of microtectonic forces created during the hydraulic fracturing process which modify the local stress anisotropy near the wellbore for a short period of time. Because of the temporary changes in the rock stress landscape from creating and extending an initial hydraulic fracture, a brief time window exists following that fracture creation wherein a secondary hydraulic fracture can be created in a similar location in a completely different direction. The second fracture provides direct connectivity to previously unattainable locations in the formation. As a result of the increased formation connectivity, a significant increase in well production is achievable. This new stimulation method greatly enhances the state-of-the-art in hydraulic fracturing, and challenges the industry to develop improved understanding of not only the static behavior of formation rocks, but also their transient behavior. 
This paper presents operational recommendations for conducting a multioriented hydraulic fracture (MOHF) treatment using abrasive hydra-jet assisted pinpoint hydraulic fracturing, a financial evaluation of the potential benefits of the MOHF process, and the results from a novel transient three dimensional (3D) geomechanics computational simulation of the creation of dual fractures in a formation.

The field is located near the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi, with a tight oil and gas bearing carbonate formation. Rapid pressure drop observed, indicates slow charging from reservoir. Typically a tight reservoir like this is developed by hydraulic fracturing. However there is concern of fracture containment and placement. This study was conducted to construct a 3D reservoir geomechanical base model to optimize the completion strategy and production performances for the tight reservoir. 
176 laboratory tests/measurements on cores were performed to determine the mechanical properties and petro-physical properties at different intervals in 5 wells over the field. Eight 1D mechanical earth models (MEMs) were constructed to characterize the mechanical properties and stresses along the well trajectories, and the laboratory test results were used to calibrate the mechanical property profiles of the 1D MEMs. A 3D geomechanical model was constructed using seismically-interpreted horizons and faults; mechanical property population and boundary stresses were based on the 1D MEMs. Present-day stresses within the formation and surrounding formations were simulated, and stress evolution from 2011 to 2095 was predicted. Preliminary fracture modelling was performed at two wells to understand feasibility. The major concern is to control fracture containment within the reservoir section, particularly avoiding downward growth. The results indicate that there is tendency of fracture growth downward at one well. However, the downward fracture growth at the other well is not expected. The average upward stress barrier is around 400 psi over the field and the average downward stress barrier is around 800 psi. However, the magnitude varies from location to location. Five completion methods were compared in terms of geomechanics. Acid tunnel and fishbone completion have a very low risk in horizontal well stability. Multilaterals completion has a low risk in horizontal well stability and junction integrity. Acid fracturing and proppant has a relative high risk in fracture placement and containment. It is recommended to perform further completions feasibility study to review the feasible well location, productivity enhancement, economical aspect and operational constraints. 
This study reveals that the heterogeneity in the carbonate reservoir has a significant impact on the selection of completion methods. There is a high uncertainty to decide an optimal completion strategy based on 1D geomechanical study results because the large variations in the in-situ stress and mechanical properties. Therefore, a 3D geomecanical study is necessary for the completion selection for heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs, particularly for tight thin plays.|","Tight, Stimulation, Thin Cap Rock, Geomechanics, Geomechanical"

Hydraulic fracturing optimization requires addressing numerous challenges for various reservoirs. The proposed paper presents a case study of a thinly-interbedded tight sandstone reservoir with a very low net to gross ratio in a field, onshore Australia. A geomechanical model was developed for hydraulic fracturing optimization. The low contrast in stress and rock mechanical properties between the reservoir and bounding formations posed a challenge to achieve a fracture that was confined to the pay zone, and particularly one that avoided fracturing the underlying water-bearing zone. Optimization modelling showed that the oil flow rate increased proportionately with fracture length and conductivity up to certain threshold values, above which the production benefit diminished. An injection schedule was optimized for production using a proppant and a fracturing fluid both suitable for the reservoir conditions to achieve the optimum or near-optimum fracture length and conductivity, efficient proppant transport, and confinement of the fracture above the water-bearing zone. Production prediction through the optimized fracture design in a vertical well showed a potentially uneconomic recovery. Multi-stage fracturing of a 1,500 m horizontal well was investigated as an alternative completion scenario for which the number of transverse fractures was optimized. The spacing between such horizontal wells was also investigated and optimized based on efficient drainage that could be achieved by the horizontal well with the optimum number of transverse fractures. Optimally spaced horizontal wells with an optimum number of transverse fractures were found as the most recoverable development strategy; use of injection wells for lateral sweeping and pressure maintenance, and artificial lift is likely to increase recovery further whereas infill wells are likely to be necessary for incremental production.|","Tight Reservoir, Multistage horizontal well fracturing, Interbedded stacked thin sandstone reservoir, Hydraulic fracturing, Geomechanics"

The paleo-strain estimation of the restored structures at each geological time step for carbonate reservoirs in a prospective area, Onshore Abu Dhabi was simulated using a forward geomechanical modelling technique. This technique integrates seismic information, well data, geological knowledge and decompacted horizons to 1) model the evolution of the formation deformation, 2) to predict the present-day strain, 3) to locate potential faults and 4) to predict fracture potentiality based on brittlness (?) and ""fracture intensity"" calculation. 
The decompacted geometry of twelve surfaces over geological time in onshore Abu Dhabi was used as input in the forward finite element geomechanical modelling. Three types of geological events were considered: deposition, erosion and hiatus. Both elastic and plastic deformation has contributed to the total compaction. The plastic deformation is determined by a failure envelope, which was divided into three types of failure: tensile, shear, and cap failure (also known as pore collapse or consolidation). The elastic deformation is determined by the elastic properties of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. 
Eighty (80) 1D-MEM (Mechanical Earth Models) were performed over the studied area, and the simulated present-day formation thickness at the 80 locations with an error less than 0.001 (0.1%?) was achieved. Sixteen (16) 2D forward geomechanical models along 16 selected sections were performed, and the simulated present-day formation geometry was consistent with the seismic interpretation. The predicted vertical, minimum and maximum horizontal stresses along the 16 sections were computed with the calibration of the stress profiles at selected wells, at which 1D mechanical earth models existed. The computed shear stresses were used to locate the location of potential faults or sub-seismic damage zones. Although the interpreted seismic faults were not the input in the forward geomechanical model, the fault locations predicted using this method were largely consistent with the faults location interpreted based on seismic data. In addition, a number of other areas that have no interpretation of faults were identified due to high shear stress, which indicates the existence of potential sub-seismic faults between the detectable major faults. The results show that faulting is likely to occur along the flanks of the structures (anticlines), rather than at the crest . We used the accumulated plastic strains to determine the areas with a normalized ""intensity"" of potential fractures, which are more likely to occur. Although the results were based on 16 2D sections, the 2D sections were assembled into 3D space, and the results were extrapolated to the whole 3D studied area. The predicted stresses can be used to optimize mud weight, well position and drilling direction for reducing non-production-time in drilling, and the predicted faults and fracture intensity can be used for the development of static geological and dynamic reservoir models for reservoir management. In addition the prediction of the fractures will enhance the production in the known reservoirs and may introduce a play concept for exploration.|","Carbonate reservoirs, Decompaction, Failure envelope, Geomechanical Forward Modeling, Fracture intensity"

In development of unconventional reservoirs such as tight and shale oil/gas reservoirs, hydraulic fracturing has been applied to enhance reservoir productivity. In spite of active applications of hydraulic fracturing, a shape of induced fractures is not fully understood. This paper presents the result of laboratory visualization experiment of hydraulic fracturing, which was conducted to visualize the shape of induced factures with cylindrical shale sample through the fluorescent method. An acrylic resin mixed with a fluorescent agent was used as a fracturing fluid. The resin is solidified and fixed within the samples by heat. The shape of the induced facture reveals based on different brightness under ultraviolet light irradiation. Many associated microfractures were observed around the main fractures. The fracturing fluid can be trapped in these types of microfractures by capillary force and these fractures cause lower recovery of fracturing fluid in the actual field operations. Acoustic emission (AE) was also monitored by the 16 sensors mounted the rock samples. Result from the path of main fractures identified by the resin mixed with a fluorescent substance and distribution of AE indicates good agreement between two. This helps us to examine which particular failure generates microseismicity. Although the scale difference between laboratory experiments and field operations needs to be taken into account, the shape of induced fractures is successfully characterized. We interpret the fluid leak off zone, main fracture, and branch fractures can be a source of the AE while no AE is observed at the area of the fracture with large aperature based on overlaying AE hypocenters with visualized induced fracture.

Tensile strength is a critical parameter for hydraulic fracturing, predicting crack initiation and propagation in reservoirs, especially in shale reservoirs with complex natural fractures and fissures. The tensile strength of conventional rocks, such as sandstone and limestone, has been well studied and documented. There are many studies of the tensile strength of laminated shale, which focus on scale effects, loading direction, and temperature effects; however, the studies on effects of mineralogy and the water content on tensile strength of organic-rich shales are very limited. 
The objectives of this paper are to: 1) Critically review the key parameters that affect the tensile strength of shale; and 2) Experimentally examine the effects of water content, mineralogy and lamination on tensile strength. To do so, a rigorous workflow is followed: 1) Each 1 in. long shale sample is cut into two sub-samples, A and B, of similar length; 2) X-ray computed tomography scan is performed to diagnose pre-existing cracks and defects inside the core plugs; 3) Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is then used to measure the air dry samples’ water content; 5) Sample A is placed on a load frame to measure the tensile strength; 5) Sample B is vacuumed and then saturated; 6) NMR is used to measure the water content after saturation; 7) Tensile strength of the saturated sample B is measured; 8) Samples are crushed, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microsope (SEM) and pyrolysis methods are used to estimate the mineralogy and total organic content (TOC). 
A total of 70 Mancos and 48 Eagle Ford shale samples have been tested. The experiment results show that: 1) Bedding plane/lamination has a significant effect on Eagle Ford tensile strength, but no pronounced impact observed for the Mancos shale; 2) The imbibed water significantly reduces the tensile strength by 4.4% to 51.7% as water content increases from 4.45% to 11.7%; 3) Pre-existing detectable micro-fractures can significantly reduce the tensile strength by up to 66%; 4) Eagle Ford exhibits typical brittle hard rock failure configuration, with primary facture and secondary fracture being observed, while for the Mancos shale, only primary fractures are observed; 5) Acoustic velocity test results confirm that Eagle Ford is mechanically transversely isotropic, and Mancos is likely mechanically isotropic.|","organic-rich gas shale, water content, lamination, Tensile strength, mineralogy"

Integration of logging-while-drilling (LWD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and azimuthal acoustic tools with a geomechanical study resulted in successful drilling of the first horizontal Ratawi Shale well in Kuwait. This tool combination was used for the first time in Kuwait as a part of the bottom hole assembly (BHA), in addition to conventional formation evaluation tools, to acquire porosity without using radioactive sources. 
A deviated 8.5-in. borehole section of a well was planned through unconsolidated sand-shale sequences by kicking off from vertical and landing at an inclination of 90°. This geological section is typically crucial from a borehole stability point of view. Borehole deterioration and significant variations in pore pressure can create a high risk of becoming stuck-in-hole. The use of conventional porosity tools in a LWD BHA with installed radioactive sources would significantly elevate the risks to an environmental-hazard level. Additionally, even retrievable-based sources become problematic for successful extraction in high angle wells. Use of sourceless porosity was the perceived solution. 
LWD NMR and azimuthal acoustic tools, free of radioactive sources, were run for the first time in a LWD tool combination, with the primary objective to measure porosity, pressure prediction, and possible anisotropy using a centralized four-axis acoustic caliper. 
Previous experiences in the same geological setting encountered borehole enlargements by approximately 5 in. after only 15 to 16 hours. LWD helped bypass this issue and acquired high-quality data before borehole enlargement occurred. Additionally, indications of the presence of possible rock anisotropy were observed. The results were then correlated and matched to offset well data and existing field geomechanics knowledge. 
Well placement within a sweet spot of 6- to 8-ft thickness in the 6.125-in. lateral section was challenging and required the integration of at-bit measurements as well as distance-to-boundary geosteering tools to reach this objective. 
This paper discusses the planning, design, and execution using LWD, NMR, and azimuthal acoustic tools in this well. It also discusses the viability, integrity, and robustness of logged data as well as interpreted results.

Previously, the section was drilled with a two-bit trip strategy because of various formation types and hardness; a tungsten carbide insert (TCI) bit for Tertiary limestone and interbedded sand, and a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) for Wangarlu shale and Puffin sand. Deepwater drilling is a high-cost operation. The new hybrid bit design is a solution to drill the section with one bit run and to save approximately 28 hours of tripping time. In addition, this run improves rate of penetration (ROP), especially in the ""hard limestone"" above Wangarlu. 
The revolutionary PDC and roller-cone hybrid drill bit combines roller cone and fixed-cutter elements. The bit is designed to combine the best attributes of both bit types; the fast aggressive drilling action of the PDC and the smooth, low-torque action of the TCI. Hybrid bits are now being employed in difficult and challenging applications worldwide and are delivering a step change in performance and significantly lowering overall costs. 
This paper presents the results of a field test in a deepwater application, and compares the performance of hybrid bits with conventional PDC and roller-cone bits used on offset wells. The interval was drilled in one run, saving USD 1M. Furthermore, the client saved an additional 23 hours, which is equivalent to USD 900,000, by achieving an ROP that is 45% faster than the best offset well.|","drill bit, hybrid, timor sea, deepwater"

Producing unconventional resources through hydraulic fracturing is a continuous learning process where the fracture stimulation design can change throughout the life of the field development. The well completion technique can change because of many reasons such as lessons learned from previous stimulations, new technology, and the heterogeneous nature of the reservoir. 
This paper focusses on real world data of hydraulic fracture stimulation properties sourced from public databases which is reported from wells drilled in the Heritage Field near Dawson, British Columbia. These wells are licensed as horizontal wells targeting gas production from the Montney Formation. 
By plotting and mapping the fracture stimulation data collected from the area and focusing on a set of operators with major operations in the area, this paper demonstrates how the fracture stimulation has changed over time and illustrates the design changes of the fracture stimulations for each operator over their own development timeline. 
This paper also discusses the collaboration initiatives that were implemented as the development progressed to highlight how industry and regulators can work together to responsibly produce the resource most effectively while still maintaining healthy competition.|","Optimization, Fracture stimulation, Montney, Completion design, Field data"

Hydraulic fracturing is an important technique widely used for to improve well productivity in tight reservoirs and enable economic development. Geomechanical modeling is an important prerequisite required to ensure effective fracture construction and the required contact with the formation. In this paper, we show the first successful hydraulic fracturing in the Offshore Abu Dhabi clastic sand formations in which geomechanical modeling played an essential role in fracture design, completion design and successful execution. 
The geomechanical properties and behavior of the clastic sand formations are still largely unknown in the Abu Dhabi region. In other parts of the Arabian Plate this formation is known to be a complex geological environment with high fracture gradients, poorly consolidated intervals, natural fractures and often rock that exhibits poroelastic behavior. 
Due to the aforementioned complex geological environment resulting geomechanical attributes, the fracture design and key inputs including the calibrated Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) were essential to the successful design and execution of the first hydraulic fracturing in the Offshore Abu Dhabi clastic sand formations. The lessons learned during this successful design and application is critical for the design of future wells and the development of the UAE clastic sand formations. 
The constructed MEM played a key role in successful hydraulic fracturing. Fracture height, length, width, direction, complexity and overall fracture performance are all largely controlled by the formation stresses, stress direction, rock properties and complexity of the rock fabric. 
Geomechanical properties in the clastic sand formations in Abu Dhabi offshore were evaluated with less uncertainty by utilizing the advanced MEM. The calibrated MEM was integrated with an advanced fracture design simulator to optimize hydraulic fracture design. Results of the advanced MEM agreed well with fracture diagnostics and temperature surveys. 
Work flow in this geomechanical analysis can be applied to hydraulic fracturing in other offshore tight reservoirs with a complex geological environment. Understanding the geomechanical properties of a formation allows engineers to optimize well placement, completion design, perforation placement, charge/gun selection and fracture design for improved well productivity.|","Unconventional gas, Hydraulic Fracturing, Sandstone, HPHT, Geomechanics"

Drilling a 12<U+00BC>-in hole section in the Agbami field offshore Nigeria presents a number of challenges.The section contains abrasive sandstone and shale that are interbedded with sandstone and siltstone, and all have unconfined compressive strengths (UCS) that vary across the field. The abrasive sandstone/shale section has UCS of 12,000 psi, and the interbedded sandstone/siltstone section has UCS of 15,000 psi or higher. The variation in lithology, formation strength, and abrasion/impact index make ensuring shoe to total depth (TD) runs with consistent ROP difficult because the conditions dull the polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit's cutting structure, leading to a significant reduction in ROP before reaching section TD. 
An operator wanted to drill the 12<U+00BC>-in section from shoe to TD in a single run with a 45% improvement in average ROP compared with the four-well offset median of 38.26 ft/h. 
To accomplish the objectives, the operator required a PDC bit with a differentiating drilling action designed to increase penetration rates and extend bit life in heterogeneous formations. A finite element analysis (FEA)-based modeling system was used to experiment with cutter types and their placement to improve drilling performance. 
Based on the modeling work, design engineers recommended a conical diamond element (CDE) with a thick synthetic diamond layer. 
The diamond layer on the CDE is approximately twice as thick as a conventional PDC cutter and exhibits 25% more wear resistance with almost double the impact strength. The element's unique geometry delivers high point loading for effective formation fracture. To fully exploit the CDE's advantages, the PDC bit body was redesigned by selectively abbreviating the blades at bit center and positioning a single CDE in the void space. The modeling system was also used to generate an operating parameter roadmap to maximize performance. 
The new 12<U+00BC>-in central CDE bit drilled the 2,320-ft section from shoe to TD at 92.06 ft/h, a 102% increase in ROP compared with the best offset rate of 45.64 ft/h over a 2,419-ft interval. The performance improvement, which was achieved on the first deployment of the bit in this application, reduced drilling time by approximately 26 hours, saving the operator USD 1.2 million in offshore rig time. The bit design was deployed in another well where a comparatively heavier mud weight was used, but the run still recorded an outstanding increase in ROP over the best offset.|","Nigeria optimization, drill bit innovation, increase ROP, Conical Diamond Element, Agbami field"

Modern hydraulic fracture treatments are specifically designed to unlock reserves from particular rock types, especially in unconventional reservoirs. Progressive improvements in fracture design can be critically informed by post stimulation pressure analysis, yet this process is often overlooked. This paper documents the evolution of fracture designs by successively incorporating post-stimulation pressure analyses after major design changes that ultimately led to the design-optimization of fracture treatments in low permeability coals. The coals under context are the Walloons coal measures in Jurassic to Cretaceous aged rocks in the Surat Basin of southeast Queensland, Australia. 
Significant challenges are faced in stimulating the Walloons coal measures due to their thin-bedded nature, that range from 0.2 to 3.0 m [0.66 to 9.8 ft] in thickness and, which are also inter-bedded with low permeability siltstones, minor sandstones and carbonaceous shales. Net coal thickness is 20 to 40 m [98.43 to 131.23 ft] in a gross sequence of 300 to 400 m [948.3 to 1,312.3 f] thickness. Reservoir complexity is further impacted by lateral continuity variations of coals, which generally have a high Poisson’s ratio (>0.32). In particular where coal reservoirs display low permeability, understanding and implementing reservoir beneficial fracture treatments becomes pivotal to successful well performance. 
Modification of fracture designs during the fracture campaign included changing key parameters such as fluid types, pump rates, proppant loading and gel concentration. Both, the treatment and the calculated bottom-hole pressures, were evaluated using 3D fracture models, supplemented by an array of diagnostics such as surface tilt-meters, diagnostic fracture injection tests, micro-seismic monitoring and tracer logs as well as log derived stress models. The results of these diagnostics helped shape the design changes implemented throughout the campaign and has influenced designs for future trials also. Ultimately, it was observed that the treatments that were pumped using low gel loadings in conjunction with high proppant concentrations, and at relatively lower rates, resulted in better well performance. 
This paper presents the design and treatment evaluation process and also provides an insight into the progression of fracture design and subsequent treatments which were successful in overcoming reservoir complexities. The outlined approach can be used to refine hydraulic fracture treatment designs in similar complex reservoirs in Queensland, with worldwide applicability.|","csg, coal, walloons, fracturing, surat"

Unconventional oil reservoirs have taken a prominent role in the United States as a source of crude oil. Different methodologies to estimate reserves for shale gas and coal bed methane have, thus far, proved to be reliable, but no simple yet accurate workflow has been generally accepted to forecast production and estimate reserves for shale oil. To fill this gap in technology, we proposed and validated a workflow that integrates analytical methods with empirical methods. The final methodology is both easily applied and accurate. In developing the final workflow, we evaluated several alternatives, most of which proved to be unsuitable. We also investigated the use of a filter to eliminate outliers in a systematic way, as proposed by Rastogi (2014). 
The workflow was successfully applied to three of four volatile oil wells in the Eagle Ford shale, with similar results. The analytical model that best matched the wells is called the Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) Bounded Model. We tested this and other models using a new field production analysis tool software. While accurate, this modeling approach is too time consuming for routine use. We found that a simple empirical approach that led to the same results as the analytical model was a 3-segment Arps decline model. The early flow regime was transient linear for all the wells; thus an Arps ""b"" parameter of two was appropriate. When boundary-influenced flow (BIF) appeared later, b-values of 0.2 were found appropriate. The initial decline rate (Di) value during BIF was modified in mid-segment leading to a distinct third segment. Our workflow also led to reliable forecasts of production (to date) of the gas-oil ratio for the three wells.|","forecast, production, workflow, shale oil"

The unconventional revolution in North America has attracted large investments from national oil companies (NOCs) and international oil companies (IOCs) eager to gain knowledge and add profitable unconventional resources to their asset portfolios. A key element of realizing this goal is the rapid and effective development of in-house technical personnel to support the effort. In 2008, a major NOC in Asia began its unconventional quest with an initial entry into a coal seam gas (CSG) opportunity in Australia, followed by investments in shale gas plays in the prolific Canadian North Montney area. To develop the much needed in-house capability, the NOC partnered with a major service provider to develop and deliver training programs to prepare its geoscientists and engineers to work within the unconventional division. 
Previous efforts by the NOC to develop in-house unconventional capabilities were hampered by a lack of data specific to their joint-venture shale assets. The newly established Unconventional Division had recently acquired an interest in Canadian Unconventional assets, and challenged the joint team to design a capability development program that would utilize this data, deliver practical experience, and build critical staff knowledge, in less than 6 months. The NOC agreed to provide data from their Canadian asset to enable the development of an accelerated, immersive program. 
The redesigned 10-week program used a source rock reservoir development workflow that incorporated a geoscience and engineering software suite to enable participants to review the field data and evaluate optimization opportunities. The goal-oriented tasks were to evaluate the project areas and develop the in-place gas resource to reach plateau production. 
The program was conducted entirely in Kuala Lumpur at the service provider's offices between September 8 and November 20, 2014, with development plan results presented to the NOC's management in Kuala Lumpur and Calgary.

Unconventional shale mechanical parameters are important for many applications such as reservoir stress-state determination, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing design among other engineering design parameters. These parameters include Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, cohesion, angle of internal friction, and unconfined compressive strength. Their determination is commonly performed on single-stage triaxial (SST) compression tests using three or more core samples at various confining pressures. For unconventional shale, this has been a practical bottleneck - it is very difficult to drill multiple plugs with good quality from a whole core because of its brittleness and complexity. An alternative procedure is the multi-stage triaxial (MST) compression test, which requires only one plug to be tested. However, its main problem lies in the practical difficulty in determining the failure envelope of the sample. Judgment must be made regarding the stress-strain state ""immediately prior to failure"". It is not uncommon that a wrong estimation of the failure state occurs when interpreting these stress-strain curves. The MST test uses one plug, which in itself could be a significant advantage. 
This paper presents a robust modified method of the MST compression test that accurately determines the imminent rock failure through continuously monitoring the radial deformation. To test and validate the method, Berea sandstone and Mancos shale plugs are selected to perform a series of the SST and MST tests. For each rock type, at least four plugs are used, which are cut from the same whole core or have similar lithofacies. Experimental results show that the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope can be generated perfectly from both the SST and MST tests. However, the failure parameters derived from the MST tests are lower than those from the SST tests. The difference may be attributed to the intrinsic heterogeneity of rock samples or the damage accumulated from the early stages in a MST test. The proposed MST method is an efficient alternative to generate the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope when the availability of core samples with good quality is limited, especially in the exploration and development of unconventional reservoirs.|","Unconventional shale, Failure envelope, Geomechanics, Characterization, Multistage triaxial tets"

This paper presents a field case study, which integrates Digital Rock Physics (DRP) techniques and downhole logging measurements, to enhance the prediction of formation absolute permeability and drainage capillary pressure from well log data. The approach first generates numerically a digital rock model representing the formation at each given depth of interest, and then uses the model as input to simulate fluid flow and capillary-dominated fluid displacement for the determination of capillary-pressure curve and absolute permeability. Rock models are constrained by formation parameters derived from logging data, and created by simulating the way the clastic rock formed over millions of years, with periods of grain sedimentation, compaction and diagenesis. All input parameters for the rock modeling including the density, porosity, grain mineralogy, grain-size distribution (GSD), cement and clay content, are obtained directly or indirectly from downhole logging measurements. 
The method's feasibility and applicability are demonstrated by applying the DRP modeling technique to one set of field data from a North Sea well contained a complete suite of logs. Cores are extensively taken from the well-consolidated sandstone formations. Laboratory measurements provide the measured permeability and capillary pressure for comparison. At various depths, the predicted permeability of rock models is in good agreement with the measured values of core sampes from the same depth, and mostly falls within the same order of magnitude as the measurements. Compared to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-based Coates model, the DRP-based approach gives a better predicted permeability when both methods use default values in their parameters. In addition, three depths representing different sandstone zones are randomly selected to investigate the effect of surface relaxivity on the predicted GSD, permeability and capillary pressure of rock models. When the surface relaxivity of 3 µm/s is used in this study, the DRP permeability at these depths matches very well with core measurements as well as the mobility calculated from formation tester measurements. Also, their entry capillary pressures are consistent with those from core measurements. However, the simulated pressure curves differ in shape from the measured ones, which may be attributed to limited variation of grain sizes used in the rock modeling. The promising results stemming from this study confirm the feasibility of combining the DRP technique with downhole logging measurements to accurately and reliably predict formation petrophysical properties in a timely and cost-effective manner.|","Digital rock physics, Sandstone reservoir, log interpretation, petrophysical property prediction, Rock modeling"

Faster reservoir simulation turnaround time continues to be a major industry priority. Simultaneously, model sizes are reaching a billion cells and the recovery mechanisms and reservoir management processes to be modeled are rapidly changing and are becoming computationally more expensive. A new reservoir modeling solution has been developed to quickly solve these largest and most complex modeling studies within ExxonMobil. 
This latest generation reservoir simulator has been designed from the ground up with 60 years of internal reservoir simulator development experience. Some of the key learnings incorporated into the new reservoir simulator include a requirement for a flexible and modular software framework, a general flow formulation that is decoupled from a very fast and highly accurate phase behavior engine, and unstructured architecture for unstructured grids. This simulator is optimized for massive distributed memory parallelism to take advantage of ExxonMobil's world class supercomputer, Discovery. 
A new fluid agnostic formulation has been developed based on general material balance. A highly optimized and highly accurate fluid library supports liquid-liquid-vapor calculations and is the only differentiation between black-oil and compositional options. These considerations are critical for maintaining computationally efficient software under heavy software development with a large development team. 
The distributed memory parallelism has been tested and has shown to be very efficient on the Discovery platform. Strong scalability tests have been run to 16,000 cores with good parallel performance to 6000 unknowns per core. These are some of the largest core counts for parallel reservoir simulation with unstructured grids seen in the industry and reduce model run times from days to minutes. These drastically reduced run times have allowed the new simulator to include heavy computational methods, such a nonlinear finite volumes or implicit reactions, for practical use as well as supporting very large models in excess of 100 million cells. 
Flexible well management control is provided through Python scripts. This allows users to customize asset-specific control strategies via a well-known and straight-forward scripting language. Alternatively, an internal optimization engine can manage the field subject to high level constraints provided by the user.|","Reservoir Simulation, Python, High Performance Computing, Parallel"

Driven piles are used to support the majority of offshore oil and gas structures with jacket structures supported by axially loaded piles still remaining the most common form of fixed offshore platform. Piles for conventional platforms are normally driven open-ended steel piles. This paper presents general considerations regarding the use of helical (or screw) piles as a novel foundation system for offshore structures. This type of pile has many advantages over driven piles, these include; ease of installation, the ability to remove using a reverse torque technique and cost savings due to much smaller installation vessel requirements. Other uses of helical piles are as support system for anchoring systems used for floating structures (e.g. tension leg platforms, SPARS, semi-submersible production platforms). To investigate their potential a joint research project was performed between BAUER Maschinen GmbH and University College Dublin (UCD). This project to date has involved small-scale laboratory tests, full-scale field tests and finite element modelling. This paper reports the results from finite element (FE) analyses that investigated the effects of the pile geometry, soil stiffness and soil friction angle on the compression and tension capacity of a helical pile in sand. In total, 48 models were created using Plaxis 3D. Axial tension and compression load tests were performed for piles with an embedment depth of 6m. In addition to the FE analyses, a series of laboratory model tests were performed in a large sample of sand at UCD. The primary purpose of these tests was to study the effect of installation method on the capacity of a helical pile. Wished-In-Place (WIP) piles (formed by placing the pile in the testing chamber prior to sample preparation), with helical helix-to-shaft ratios of 1.2 and 2.5 were load tested and their capacity was compared to the piles installed using the torque method. The results of the lab tests suggest that torque installation results in compaction of the sand around the pile. As a result the uplift capacity of the pile of the torque installed pile was much higher than the WIP pile. The wall thickness depending on the maximum applied torque and the permissible torsion stress of the steel is also briefly discussed.|","oil&gas platforms, geotechnical properties, finite element analysis, pull-out capacity, helical piles"

Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing is a key technique used for improving well productivity in shale gas/oil reservoirs. However, the outcome of this technique is inconsistent from area to area. This is believed to be due to the rough design of hydraulic fracturing because of lack of knowledge of how fracture branches are initiated and populated. The objective of this study was to develop an analytical method to predict the population and the average length of fracture branches for maximizing Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV). 
This study used calculus of variations to derive an analytical model for predicting the time-dependent population and dimension of fracture branches clusters of perforations. The rate of propagation of created fracture branches is simulated along the path of the minimum energy in the system. Lagrangian of the system is determined by the energy transfer from kinetic energy to pressure energy, elastic-potential energy, surface energy and heat loss due to friction. The condition for Hamilton's integral to be stationary is that the Lagrangian of the system satisfies the Euler equation. 
The SRV was formulated as a function of dimension of fracture branches, number of perforation clusters and the orientation of the horizontal wellbore relative to the maximum horizontal stress. A case study of Woodford Shale indicates that the concept of FCI does reflect the complexity of fractures in the real world. The mathematical model reveals that after rapid growth at the very beginning, the number of fracture branches increases slowly. The growth rate of fracture branch declines with time. A sensitivity analysis with the analytical model indicates that the population of fracture branches at any given time increases with fluid injection rate. It is concluded that the growth rate of SRV in the reservoir declines with pumping time. The efficiency of creating SRV should be maximized by quickly pumping dense and viscous hydraulic fluid over a short time period in each stage of fracturing. The distance between perforation clusters should be optimized based on the average length of fracture branches given by the optimal stage-pumping time. 
This study first time presents an analytical model to predict population and the average length of fracture branches. It provides petroleum engineers a rigorous method for maximizing the SRV in volume stimulation of shale gas/oil reservoirs.|","Hydraulic, Fracturing, Shale Gas, Reservoirs, Optimization"

The apparent permeability and effective porosity of organic-shale nanopores are time-varying under the impacts of gas adsorption/desorption, non-Darcy flow, and stress dependence during gas production. However, the porosity occupied by adsorbed gas is usually disregarded by industry standard. Moreover, the gas flow regimes are not completely described in most models or simulators; the stress dependence of matrix does not draw adequate attention in current studies. Therefore, an appropriate modeling is urgently needed to simulate the dynamics and performances during gas production. In this paper, we developed a coupled model to characterize time-variation properties by considering contributions of gas adsorption, non-Darcy flow, and stress dependence. After that, we verified the model and demonstrated model application, which lead to new insights into the evaluation of rock properties and gas quantities during gas production. We found that taking account of the volume occupied by adsorbed gas can effectively avoid the significant error of OGIP (Original Gas in Place) in the classical models. Meanwhile, the apparent permeability is significantly reduced by adsorbed gas, but the time-varying apparent permeability affected by gas flow regimes increases during gas production. We also studied the complex behaviors of the effects of stress dependence and various flow regimes. This new model provides with a more clear understanding of the time-varying features of organic-shale nanopores during gas production, which is more advantageous than classical models. As the production process can be more accurately forecasted, more insights can be achieved by the improved simulations.|","Gas adsorption, Time-varying properties, Non-Darcy flow, shale gas reservoir, Stress-dependence"

It is crucial to place a horizontal shale gas well in the optimized position of the sweet section for effective stimulation. However well placement in the Silurian Longmaxi gas shale formation in Sichuan Basin presents significant challenges. This paper presents an integrated approach to ensure horizontal wells 100% placed in the expected positions of the sweet section. 
This integrated approach firstly constructed a 3D geological model as reference of the overall trend of structural variations and dynamically updated it per drilling progress. This model contains interpreted micro-structures, micro-faults and natural fracture corridors to reduce structural and lateral reservoir uncertainty. Secondly, the structural correlation in the True Stratigraphic Thickness (TST) domain method enhanced the capability and reliability in the presence of multiple cyclic GR sequences of the shale formation. The innovative real-time multi-scenario forward modeling in the TST domain can identify the most likely scenario to make decision on the probable bit position and its penetrating direction. Finally, a risk mitigation strategy was applied in case of extreme. 
The Longmaxi formation contains numerous sub-seismic micro-structures with suddenly local structure changes and micro-faults with unknown displacements. Its sweet section has five sub-layers (I1-I5) with respectively regressive or transgressive GR sequences. But the optimal horizontal lateral position for hydraulic fracture initiating and ultimately effective stimulation is within the sub-layers I-3 to I-4 with about 10 meters of thickness only. Not only requires it accurately landing and placing the lateral, also as smooth wellbore as possible with minimized dog-legs for consequent casing and cementing operations because of the fairly deep depth and high dip angles of the Longmaxi. Hence the standard geosteering method, which updates a 2D cross-section model for structural correlation using changes in GR values and formation dips, can often be insufficient. 
The integrated approach were implemented after one well had significant parts of lateral drilled out of the sweet section. It ensured all drilled wells were accurately placed 100% along the optimal position. It proves that efficient well placement constrained by Oil Based Mud environment can be achieved by cost-effective geosteering tools through this integrated approach. The most difficulty situation was that one horizontal well can encounter multiple sub-seismic micro-structures and / or micro-faults with frequent local structural changes. Examples highlight the capability of this approach to handle complex situations in comparing with the standard method. Helped by proactive well placement, drilling efficiency, and casing and cementing operations were improved by evolving understanding of in-situ geology and stresses. High production achieved boosts the economics to develop this shale gas field, also confirms the success of this integrated approach.|","Well Placement, Sichuan Basin, multi-scenario forward modeling, Shale Gas, Longmaxi Formation"

In volatile times, when oil prices are in a decline, efficiencies and asset utilization are critical elements to ensure sustainability in the market for both operators and service companies. However, maximizing utilization and pushing equipment to the maximum could potentially have negative repercussions and ultimately result in failures causing loss of time and other potential damages. Thus is it critical to closely monitor and evaluate the assets conditions to ensure both safe and efficient operations are performed. 
In the case of coiled tubing (CT) strings, monitoring and proper evaluation can be performed by utilizing an infield nondestructive evaluation (NDE) device that employs magnetic flux leakage (MFL) to detect flaws and monitor, wall thickness, outer diameter, and various other properties. The real-time device requires no direct contact with pipe, and its compact design allows it to be run continuously throughout the life of the CT. Damage can then be detected and managed before a failure occurs. The ultimate goal is to reduce CT failures while increasing CT longevity throughout the operations. 
This paper covers three specific examples of NDE inspection conducted on site that increased the utilization of the CT string without compromising the service quality delivery. It also reviews the various parameters that were monitored and evaluated on location and the decision-making process used to keep the strings in service longer than previous methods would have allowed thus safely increasing the utilization and improving the efficiency. 
The first two cases are out of Texas, USA. The objective of the NDE was monitoring the pipe for corrosion or physical plastic deformation. This region regularly performs high-pressure cycling operations and in the past relied mostly on calculated fatigue models with significant derated values and safety factors to retire strings from use. Utilizing the scanning devices from after manufacturing through the strings' life allowed both the operator and the service company get more useable footage and still retire the strings after getting indications of irreversible geometric changes. They were able to plan and control the CT retirement around operational well plans to ensure no delays were seen in the field. 
The third example is out of Alberta, Canada. A CT string being used on a long-term project was damaged. The NDE inspection allowed for continued use of a pipe that had visible surface damage. In the past, this string would have been immediately retired and removed from service after a mechanical defect of the same nature was observed; however, the NDE device aided in adressing the severity of the damage, by MFL, and monitored its progress while continuing to use the string. The 2.375-in. string was able to be run an additional 53,203-m [174,550-ft] in a safe and controlled manner before reaching retirement.|","Pipe Integrity, NDE, Inspection, Coiled Tubing"

Developing gas reserves from relatively tight formations are conducted by the use of a multistage fracturing (MSF) technique that enables maximizing reservoir contact by creating multiple fractures along the wellbore. The key to successful MSF treatment is to generate independent fracture propagation and ensuring the bottom-hole treating pressure (BHTP) is maintained above the fracture closure stress (FCS) also sometimes referred to as the fracture gradient or minimal horizontal stress (smin), for the fracture to propagate. 
Both the open hole (OH) multistage (OHMS) assembly and the cased hole plug and perforation completion (PPC) methods are applied for fracturing horizontal wells. Cement behind the liner in PPC provides excellent seal and isolation between stages that cannot be achieved using either mechanical or swellable OH packers used in OHMS. Failure to maintain complete isolation between stages will not allow stand-alone fracture propagation, thereby reducing the number of originally designed fracture stages. This will reduce contact area and well performance. PPC, on the other hand, depends on manually perforating reservoir intervals and missing the sweet spot due to any misinterpretation of the OH logs will misalign the perforation gun with the reservoir section, thereby reducing reservoir contact significantly, and consequently, gas production. 
The OHMS fracturing has proven very effective in the carbonate reservoirs when wells are drilled parallel to smin and completed with swellable packers. The chances of generating individual fractures are high and the open lateral allows gas flow into the wellbore directly in addition to the production through the induced fractures. The amount of gas flow through the OH section depends on the vertical permeability and how efficiently the near wellbore section is etched and cleaned by the acid pumped. 
One type of PPC, where a single interval is perforated in multiple predetermined spots in clusters has proven promising. This will be addressed as cluster PPC (CPPC) in this paper. The short perforated intervals create an orifice pressure drop at the entrance of the fracture during the treatment, keeping the BHTP above smin, thereby keeping the fracture open. With proper geomechanical modeling, a few perforation clusters can be optimally placed in one interval so that all can be treated by a single pumping stage, with individual fractures growing from each cluster and maximizing reservoir contact. A reservoir simulation performed to prove the benefits of CPPC completions showed that it outperforms the OHMS for a wide range of permeability values. Additional cumulative production varied from just 2% for a good quality reservoir with permeability of 1 millidarcy (md) up to 26% for a tight formation with 0.01 md permeability.|","multistage, fracturing"

The Changbei basin centred gas reservoir is located in the Palaeozoic clastic sandstone of the Shaanxi formation, Ordos basin, P.R. China. After more than a decade of successful tight gas production history, the development of the field is being expanded to include new target reservoirs. Because of its low intrinsic permeability, hydraulic fracturing stimulations are required to achieve commercial production rates from the target formation. 
Fracture diagnostics suggests high fluid efficiencies in a normally faulted stress regime. Recent monitoring data of hydraulic fracturing stimulations during an appraisal campaign indicate fracture height growth containment which is not readily predicted by the current numerical simulators. Non-radioactively traced proppant and post-injection temperature logs suggest that fracture height may be controlled by a combination of stress barriers and shale laminations. However, the current numerical simulators tend to have difficulty predicting the termination of height growth without calibration to post-job data. 
A new hydraulic fracturing code currently under development has been used to simulate the fracture treatments in the target formations. This study briefly describes the input data workflow for the new software and highlights the underlying models the simulations are based upon. The discrepancies between the model results are discussed and possible explanations put forward. The study concludes that the new code is a useful addition to the existing software, and that the thermodynamic module enables genuine comparisons with the temperature logs, which in this case are important for investigating the fracture development. The code also gives promisingly accurate pressure evolutions during the treatment when compared to measurements from a well equipped with a downhole gauge.|","tight sand, hydraulic fracturing, numerical simulations, China unconventionals"

A specially designed diamond impregnated bit set new performance records in its initial application in a hard, abrasive Oman formation. Built for turbine drilling in the formation's sandstone-siltstones-shale, the 212.72-mm (8 3/8-in) bit drilled 588 m (1929 ft) in a single run, increasing footage drilled by 14% compared to the previous-best 8 3/8-in. run with a ROP of 2.02 m/hr (6.6 ft/hr). This performance replaced 2.7 bits through increased footage drilled and drill out capabilities. When the bit was pulled due to the BHA it was dull-graded: 3-2-WT-A-X-1-LM-BHA. 
The bit developed for the Oman run was a matrix body with 16 blades. Maximum durability and performance in the high-compressive strength formation was addressed with diamond-impregnated blocks on each blade and thermo/abrasion resistant PDC cutters in the bit center. Extreme drilling conditions presented by the turbine application and formation led to an optimized impregnated segment block geometry to maximize bit durability without impacting efficiency, and a change in hydraulics to maximize cooling and cleaning of the cutting faces. 
This paper is the first published examination of the diamond impregnated bit design process and resulting field experience in the Oman application. The study discusses the basis of the bit design and considerations in achieving operator objectives, including drilling as much footage as possible from 4190 m (13,743 ft) measured depth, while maintaining an average ROP of 2 to 2.5 m/hr (6.5 to 8.2 ft/hr).

In this paper, a method is proposed to determine the fracture toughness of brittle and heterogeneous material through hydraulic fracturing. The intent of the proposed method is to deploy it on materials whose are not easily determined by standard test. One example of such a material is hydrate-bearing sand, which is unstable under atmospheric pressure and temperature. The pressure-time record, injection flow rate and total volume injection are necessary information to determine the fracture toughness of the material using the classical linear elastic fracture mechanics approach. To verify the method, frozen sand is used as a substitute material and its fracture toughness found using the standard test. Frozen sand has similar composition as natural hydrate-bearing sediment except for the absence of methane gas and high pressure.

Multiple cluster perforations are typically used for multi-stage hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells with casing hole completion to create multiple fractures in any single stage. Due to the mechanical interaction of fractures, the local principal stresses field may alter, which affects the fracture complexity. To optimize the network fracturing design, 3D multiple fractures propagation, stress distribution and fracture mechanics need to be well considered. 
Firstly, The geometry model for Fuling shale gas formation has been Established, with A depth varying initial in-situ stresses, pore pressure and permeability defined. Then, a linear Drucker-Prager model with hardening is chosen for the rock, while the casing is linear elastic. Based on damage initiation of quadratic nominal stress criterion and damage evolution of B-K critical energy release rate criterion, the tensile and shear mixed mode fracture model consists of the mechanical behavior of the fracture itself and the behavior of the fluid that enters and leaks through the fracture surfaces. 
Through the selection of general purpose finite element code ABAQUS, the multiple 3D fractures propagation process and stress interferences between fractures have been modeled. The results illustrate that mechanical interaction exists between any pairs of fractures, which greatly influences the stress distribution and the geometries and widths of the fractures. Induced stress increase is stronger in magnitude and influences larger region for the minimum horizontal stress than for the maximum horizontal stress. Spacing of perforation clusters and net pressures are two important factors for the successful application of network fracturing. It is possible that the cumulative interaction effect of several fractures could neutralize the stress anisotropy in the formation to enhance the fracture complexity. Taking advantage of the altered stress in the rock for a base case with three fractures, an adequate range of perforation clusters spacing and net pressure are determined for the network fracturing of horizontal wells in Fuling shale gas reservoir, and the treatment design is optimized accordingly. 
This numerical procedure combined with the post-fracture production rate is also used to evaluate the efficiency of network fracturing for multi-stage fractured horizontal wells in Fuling formation, which can be served as a guidance to optimize the treatment design not only for Fuling but for other shale gas and tight gas reservoirs.|","stress interference, fracture network, multiple fracture, perforation clusters, mechanical interaction"

Prediction of pore pressure and porosity in an unconventional resource assessment area of Abu Dhabi was performed by using petroleum systems modeling techniques, combining seismic and well data and geological knowledge to model sedimentary basin evolution. The study objective was ultimately to reconstruct basin history and key geological structures as a basis for further geomechanical and fracture prediction studies. Twelve surfaces were interpreted from seismic data and derived from isopach maps. These maps were used to construct the basin model. The model was built from the top of the surface sediment down to the Shuaiba formation. Sediment decompaction was modeled, which enabled the reconstruction of the formation structures through time. Athy's law, formulated with effective stress, was used in the forward modeling simulator for the calculation of pore pressure. Information such as formation ages, erosional events, and hiatus periods were taken into account during simulation. The evolution of porosity, pore pressure, temperature, and thermal maturity through time were simulated and calibrated to measured data. Model porosity is dependent on burial depth, weight of the overburden sediment columns, and lithology properties. Porosity calibration was achieved by adjusting the compaction curve to effective stress. Pore pressure was calibrated by adjusting lithology porosity-permeability relationships. Low-permeability lithologies result in high pore pressure. A regional Paleocene pore pressure reduction was observed, caused by substantial erosion of the Simsima formation. Generally, formation overpressure is observed at greater depth. Additionally, modeled overpressures depend on the evolution of connate water vectors over geological time; these vectors depend on multiple lithology parameters as well as the capillary entry pressure of adjacent model layers. In the Shilaif fm, overpressure zones were identified at the anticlinal structures. Interestingly, higher overpressure was observed in the shallower anticlinal structure. The simulation results provide the estimated porosity and pore pressure in the unconventional play, as well as the reconstruction of the overall basin geometry through time. The resulting models were subsequently used as the basis for further fracture prediction studies; results were ultimately consistent with faults derived from existing seismic interpretation. Model porosity, pore pressure, and predicted fractures will be used for the development of static geological and dynamic reservoir models.|","Pore-pressure, Carbonate reservoirs, Decompaction, Petroleum Systems Modeling, Athyaˆ™s Law"

The Spring Gully coal seam gas field of the Bowen Basin in Queensland, Australia has historically been developed using vertical wells that have been stimulated by either cavitation or hydraulic fracturing of the Bandanna coal measures. However, as the field development expands into lower reservoir quality in the fringe area of the field, there has been a shift to applying horizontal well designs with the objective of increasing economic return and minimizing environmental footprint. 
Surface to inseam (SIS pairs) have been successfully implemented in Queensland low permeability Permian coal seam gas fields. Four Surface-to-Inseam (SIS) well pairs (horizontal wells intercepting vertical producers) were drilled in Spring Gully in 2012 and 2013. Production performances of these pilot horizontal wells show improvement when compared to offset vertical wells. In order to understand the more complex fluid flow mechanism a detailed multi-segment horizontal well (MSW) fine scale simulation model was built to calibrate rate and pressure performance. Following the pilot well performance study, a large scale development optimisation exercise including spacing, pattern, orientation and well design was carried out on all future development regions. This work when coupled with a risk quantification exercise has provided an informed view on the cost benefit of applying this optimised horizontal well development in Spring Gully. 
One of the unique challenges in implementing optimised SIS horizontal wells in the Spring Gully field is the undulating topography with very steep, narrow ridgelines that are bounded by cliffs and very deep and generally inaccessible valleys.

Structural syn-rift reservoirs in faulted margins of continental rift basins are usually disregarded in exploration consideration due to concerns of absence of reliable top seal and diagenetic alterations that significantly reduce reservoir rocks’ porosity/permeability. Not an exception to this trend, Early Oligocene reservoirs in the eastern margin of Cuu Long Basin, offshore Vietnam were overlooked in the past since they were interpreted as small and scattered structures without top seals. This paper presents the re-evaluation of hydrocarbon potential of the early syn-rift plays in the flank of continental rift basins based on a case study in the eastern edge of Cuu Long Basin in light of the new seismic data as well as drilling results. 
Recent exploration results in the eastern edge of Cuu Long Basin differ from past assessment regarding early syn-rift reservoirs of the area. Re-processed and new seismic data supported by latest well data put top of granitic basement at a deeper depth than previously interpreted. As a result, syn-rift reservoirs which were small and insignificant have become large scale and two- or three-way faulted structures. Key reservoirs discovered is the basal sandstones which deposited right on top and shared a similar topography with the underlying Pre-Cenozoic granitic basement, mainly composed of near source sediment, mostly granitic fragments. These basal sandstones’ porosity and permeability have been preserved better than shallower reservoirs thanks to the unaltered Feldspars in granitic fragments. Analyses of new wells data also indicate the existence of thick and extensively distributed organic-rich shale formations on top of the basal sandstones. These black shale layers not only act as top seals to hydrocarbon migration for underneath reservoirs but also play the role of a ""stress shield"" that absorbs and dissipates vertical compaction and helps preserve porosity and/or permeability. 
The results of this study coupled with important drilling discoveries have confirmed the hydrocarbon potential in the eastern edge of Cuu Long Basin. This leads to a revived petroleum exploration and development activities in this area where early syn-rift prospects have been overlooked. Furthermore, these findings, applicable to the eastern edge of Cuu Long Basin, can be used as principal guidance for hydrocarbon evaluation and exploration strategy in similar syn-rift basins.|","Top seal, Syn-rift play, Cuu Long Basin, Basal, Eastern Edge of Cuu Long Basin"

One of the major challenges in Abu Dhabi onshore oil fields is the substantial increased water production with time. This is mainly attributed to unforeseen the presence of sub seismic faults and fractures along the drain hole. To address this, smart completions are being introduced to control water production by moderating the flow profile across the completed interval, whereby water and gas breakthrough are delayed in producing wells and injection rates are optimized in water and gas injectors across the full wellbore face. The smart completion design is supported by dynamic and static reservoir information. In this study, production logging tool (PLT) data was available to benchmark and confirm the results from dynamic simulation modeling. However, geologic features that cause the uncontrolled water inflow were not confirmed due to lack of lack of image data. 
A novel methodology has been implemented allowing resistivity image acquisition in workover wells by utilizing a compact memory tool that addresses the challenge of accessing old wells in Abu Dhabi onshore oil fields. The poor condition of the well is a result of prolonged production, post-stimulation and subsequent borehole degradation. The technique consists of acquiring data using drill pipe with significant savings in rig time and a higher chance of accessibility when compared to alternative techniques. This technique also protects the tool from becoming stuck and incurring damage during entry, thus improving data acquisition quality and minimizing the possibility of re-runs. When compared with common pipe-conveyed wireline alternatives (TLC) in previous wells, up to 33% savings in logging time was observed with a much safer operation. 
The procedure was achieved with success in terms of image data quality and execution time. In the absence of core data, the microresistivity imaging technique gives the best possible picture of the rock. It has been effective in characterizing rock fabric required for structural analysis (including fracture identification and fault identification and analysis), geomechanics, sedimentology (including paleocurrents analysis and facies determination) and image petrophysics applications such as identifying vuggy secondary porosity. A quick- turnaround in data processing allows the introduction of detailed fractures and fault interpretation, which in turn allows optimization of the completion design.|","Smart Completion, Microresistivity Log, Log Data Acquisition, Fracture Analysis"

In this paper, the problem of a hydraulic fracture interacting with a pre-existing natural fracture has been investigated by using a cohesive zone finite element model. The model fully couples fluid flow, fracture propagation and elastic deformation, taking into account the friction between the contacting fracture surfaces and the interaction between the hydraulic fracture and the natural fracture. The effect of the field conditions, such as in-situ stresses, and rock and fracture mechanical and geometrical properties, intersection angle and the treatment parameters (fracturing fluid viscosity and injection rate) on the hydraulic fracture propagation behavior has been analyzed. The finite element modeling results provide detailed quantitative information on the development of various types of hydraulic fracture – natural fracture interaction, fracture geometry evolution and injection pressure history, and allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the relative roles of various parameters. The value of a parameter calculated as the product of fracturing fluid viscosity and injection rate can be used as an indicator to gauge if crossing or diverting behavior is more likely. In addition, using a finite element approach allows the analysis to be extended to include the effects of fluid leakoff and poroelastic effect, and to study hydraulic fracture height growth through a system of nonhomogeneous layers and their bedding planes.|","Finite element method, Interaction, Fracture crossing mechanics, Cohesive zone model, Hydraulic Fracture"

The ability to obtain detailed physical measurements from subsurface samples in a controlled laboratory setting crucially depends on the quality of the retrieved core. The key to maximize core quality is to limit avoidable damage during drilling, retrieval, handling, transport and analysis. This paper focusses on the retrieval process, where core integrity can be compromised when the core is retrieved too quickly without allowing sufficient time for pore pressure equalization. Core integrity, in particular avoiding decompression damage, is a distinctive concern for low-permeability shales. A common notion is to retrieve slowly to allow for pore pressure equilibration. Operational considerations, on the other hand, demand the shortest possible retrieval time. This paper discusses a resolution to these two conflicting requirements by identifying the optimal core retrieval time using finite-element modeling and optimization techniques. 
In this paper, a core retrieval effort is modeled using an axisymmetric, finite-element representation of a core with pore fluid that is subjected to successively decreasing external pore-pressure boundary conditions and pressure loads. The modeling results are analyzed for the maximum pore-pressure difference and compared with rock strength criteria to predict potential core damage. 
The optimal retrieval time for given geometric and material parameters is determined with an optimization algorithm. The combined use of finite element modeling and optimization techniques in a reliability study enables the determination of core damage probability. This technique provides an analytical-based guideline for the shortest core-retrieval times without compromising core quality due to decompression.|","decompression damage, geomechanics, modeling, core retrieval, optimization"

The Silurian LongMaXi gas shale in the Sichuan basin is an emerging play in China. It experienced multiple major tectonic evolutions with uplifting and burying sequences in its geological time. As expected, this shale could develop tremendous small-scale discrete natural fractures (DNF) like many other notable North American gas shale plays. But only sparse DNFs were observed from several borehole images in a shale gas field. This paper presents a case study for characterizing complex multiscale natural fracture systems of the gas shale. 
In the study, natural fracture systems were classified as four types: large-scale faults, medium-scale fracture systems (including microfaults and crushed zones or fracture corridors), small-scale DNFs, and micro-scale fissures per their correspondingly scale-associated geological, geophysical, and petrophyscial features and responses. An optimized ant-tracking approach was implemented to track seismic abnormities and discontinuities as indicators of subseismic medium-scale fractures. Key components of this approach include optimized seismic gathers' angle-range, optimal scanning directions and angles, parameter adjustment criteria, and a comprehensive QC process. The QC process, which considers regional geological and tectonic evolution, fracture mechanical mechanism under strike-slip stress regime, and observations from all available resources, was implemented on each identified medium-scale fracture zone to ensure its reliability. 
This paper has more focuses on characterizing the medium-scale fracture system because of which can be a unique feature of LongMaXi gas shale compared to its North American counterparts. Characterizing of this medium-scale fracture system considers factors including fracture development mechanism and fracture pattern under strike-slip condition, structure control and curvature tendency, and intensity and amplitude of seismic discontinuity and abnormities. The study shows such medium-scale fractures are widely distributed across the study field. Complexities encountered while drilling and stimulation such as heavy mud loss or screen-out due to unexpected high leak-off rate had strong correlation with them. Two principle orientations of the medium-scale fractures were identified and further validated by outcrop observations and microseismic events observed from hydraulic fracturing monitoring. The study suggests that such medium-scale fractures may be mainly controlled by two major tectonic events during Himalayan movement because their principle orientations are almost exactly following the directions of two major tectonic movements. In combination with all types of natural fractures as defined, 3D multiscale natural fracture model and Geomechanical Earth model were established, which are two keystones for drilling quality and completion quality for further applications. 
These medium-scale fractured or crushed zones along with large-scale faults and small-scale DNFs across this shale gas field could significantly impact on efficiency and effectiveness of development. In particular, to understand how hydraulic fractures interact with such medium-scale fractures will be essential.|","LongMaXi, Multiscale Natural Fracture System, Shale Gas, Ant-tracking, Sichuan Basin"

Nowadays oil and gas exploration and production is often performed in geomechanically challenging enviroments where the risks can be high and problems are costly. Choosing the right scale and complexity of a model is critical for performing an effective and efficient geomechanical analysis that addresses the problem without unnecessarily expending resources like time, computation power or software license costs. 
In this paper different geomechanical modeling techniques are compared for their accuracy and efficiency using a relatively simple (continental slope) and a more complex geological setting (submarine canyon). This has been done by comparing the resulting state of stress of 1D well-centric geomechanical models with those of reservoir-scale 3D geocellular and 4D finite-element models. 
The more complex submarine canyon model shows that in relatively complex areas the 1D and 3D geomechanical models no longer give accurate stress results and a 4D model is needed to accurately simulate the state of stress. On the other hand, the continental shelf model shows that in a simple geological setting creating a 1D wellbore-scale geomechanical model is an efficient and effective way of calculating stress. The 1D model gives an accurate state of stress comparable with the more complex 3D and 4D reservoir-scale geomechanical models. Not having to create, simulate and analyze a reservoir-scale model can save time for better analysis of the results, dealing with uncertainties of the model and/or doing a sensitivity analysis. 
The paper concludes that the initial step in a geomechanical study is assessing the geomechanical application of the model, taking the complexity of the geological setting into account and based on that assessment chosing the modeling complexity that is necessary to get accurate results, without unnecessarily spending resources.|","Modeling, Stress, Geomechanics, Complexity, Finite Element"

The stage 2 development of the giant Shah Deniz gas-condensate field (SD2) represents an investment in excess of 45 billion USD and requires the drilling of 26 subsea development wells. Significant well cost reductions may be achieved by minimising the amount of ‘non-productive time’ (NPT) during drilling. 
NPT associated with subsurface geological characteristics may be minimised by careful pre-drill well planning, robust subsurface interpretation and data integration, application of learnings from previous Shah Deniz drilling and clear communication of subsurface risks to all parties involved in designing and executing the well. To achieve this, a dedicated team exists to provide an Integrated Subsurface Description (ISD) of the overburden and reservoir section at Shah Deniz. 
A three year plan describes the key ISD products designed to influence NPT and contribute towards the safe and efficient drilling of wells. These ISD products include an ‘ever-green’ geological model of the field, with overburden, reservoir and aquifer descriptions, plus 3D models of stress and pore-pressure. Such is the complexity of the pore pressure story at Shah Deniz that this represents one of the biggest risks to safe delivery of the wells required for SD2. Delivery of a detailed overburden ISD is enabled by comprehensive interpretation and integration of all well and seismic data acquired over the past 18 years. 
This paper will focus on some of the tools and techniques used to enhance understanding of the overburden geology at Shah Deniz, types of overburden products generated and how they are used in well planning.|",""

Stratigraphic variations in rock type control gas production. Hydraulic fracturing delivers economic gas production. |We drilled horizontal wells more than 4,000 ft long consisting of more than 12 hydraulic-fracturing stages. The good gas-producing rock-type reservoirs are usually less than 14-ft thick and exhibit strong diagenetic overprint. Low gas prices challenge the use of sophisticated geosteering logs. By use of a very-basic gamma ray (GR) log and very-limited offset-pilot-well data, chasing such thin and variable sand bodies over a distance of 4,000 ft in a marginal marine sedimentary environment is daunting. Apart from this, horizontal wells that target thin layers present unique challenges to completion optimization. |We acquired quad-combo log data, including azimuthal-density image data, by use of a logging-while-drilling (LWD) tool. We performed extensive log modeling by combining the horizontal well logs with logs from the two offset vertical wells, and achieved consistent interpretation.

This involves estimating parameters such as remaining oil saturation, trapped gas saturation, and three-phase relative permeability by carrying out and by interpreting several CO2 WAG experiments representative of flows inside the reservoir (i.e., pressure and temperature conditions, fluids, capillary number). This paper presents an experimental design, an apparatus, and a procedure to carry out such experiments at reservoir conditions with extensive and up-to-date data-acquisition techniques. |Two CO2/water cyclic injections were performed at reservoir conditions, on horizontal carbonate cores with light oil from a Middle East field, far above minimum miscibility pressure (MMP). Great care was given to the data-acquisition systems set for the experiments. Produced volumes were monitored to provide material balance of each phase at both reservoir and laboratory conditions with a clear separation of flashed oil, condensate, and gas. A full compositional analysis of the fluids produced was then conducted, with gas chromatography (GC) and liquid analysis of flashed oil and condensate. Differential pressure across the core was monitored for relative-permeability estimation. Finally, a dual-energy X-ray scanner was used to measure three-phase in-situ saturations, cross check material-balance results, highlight gravity segregation, and ensure that laboratory artifacts (end effects) do not influence interpretation conclusions. |Several material-balance methods were investigated to accurately calculate the average saturations and the recovery factor in the presence of strong CO2/oil interactions. With our experimental design, we were able to decouple thermodynamic effects (stripping) from three-phase flow effects (sweeping) in the raw-production data.

Bartko and Brian Coffin, Saudi Aramco, and Roberto Tineo, Schlumberger, prepared for the 2014 SPE Middle East Oil and Gas Show and Conference, Manama, Bahrain, 8–11 March. The paper has not been peer reviewed. |Shale-gas resources were explored in Saudi Arabia by adopting a “technology-driven” approach against the US-based approach that might be termed the “factory” or “statistical” approach. The technology-driven approach and the customized work flow applied in this project have minimized the time required to understand the reservoir and apply the appropriate technologies. To date, this work flow has been used and calibrated with single-well analysis. |Introduction |The technology-driven approach to acquiring data was accomplished by maximizing data collection and developing a customized work flow to rapidly incorporate lessons learned for the next wells drilled. The overall challenge was to perform the assessment quickly and execute operations efficiently because of the quick drilling program with multiple rigs working. |Typically, a resource rock is evaluated, tested, and produced with individual tools and optimized by a statistical approach because of the number of wells drilled and completed in the area. In the study case, the well is an exploration well 1500 km away from the oilfield infrastructure with no offset-well information to support evaluation of the well. The approach was to build a single functioning model, combining a basin resource work flow with a hydraulic fracture- design work flow. The foundation pieces for this model must contain, at minimum, the following: |Core: Acquiring a core is essential because rock properties are required in geology, petrophysics, geomechanics, drilling, and fracturing. Both resource and bounding layers need to be included in this work. |Petrophysics: Logging programs need to deliver all data for the models and to be recalibrated on the basis of core and performance of the well. |Geology: A depositional model is critical because tectonism influences the trapping potential of the source rock. Recalibration is performed on the basis of the core and petrophysics. |Geomechanics: Both isotropic- and anisotropic-based models need to be constructed for drilling and stimulation requirements. The models need to integrate static core data and dynamic logging data, recalibrated with vertical well stress testing through microfracturing, if possible. |Drilling: Geomechanics is necessary for proper landing and drilling of the horizontal well along with the proper construction of the completion to handle pump rates and pressure. |Stimulation modeling: The model needs to be built on geological information of the area, and petrophysical and geomechanical data. The model should also incorporate mechanical limitations on the basis of completion capabilities such as maximum treating pressures or poor cementbond logs. |Microseismic: This provides an effective stimulation volume. The process needs to be integrated into the stimulation execution in realtime mode. |Production Data: A simplistic production model should be developed initially to understand production declines associated with stimulated volumes and fracture geometries.

In naturally fractured reservoirs, hydraulic-fracture treatments may induce complex-fracture geometries that one cannot model accurately and efficiently with Cartesian and corner-point grid systems or standard dual-porosity approaches. The interaction of hydraulic and naturally occurring fractures almost certainly plays a role in ultimate well and reservoir performance. Current simulation models are unable to capture the complexity of this interaction. Generally speaking, our ability to detect and characterize fracture systems is far beyond our capability of modeling complex natural-fracture systems. To evaluate production performance in these complex settings with numerical simulation, fracture networks require advanced meshing and domain-discretization techniques. This paper investigates these issues by developing natural-fracture networks with fractal-based techniques. After a fracture network is developed, we demonstrate the feasibility of gridding complex natural-fracture behavior with optimization-based unstructured meshing algorithms. Then we can demonstrate that one can simulate natural-fracture complexities such as variable aperture, spacing, length, and strike. This new approach is a significant step beyond the current method of dual-porosity simulation that essentially negates the sophisticated level of fracture characterization pursued by many operators. |We use currently established code for fractal discrete-fracture-network (FDFN) models to build realizations of naturally fractured reservoirs in terms of stochastic fracture networks. From outcrop, image-log, and core analysis, it is possible to extract fracture fractal parameters pertaining to aperture, spacing, and length distribution, including center distribution as well as a fracture strike. Then these parameters are used as input variables for the FDFN code to generate multiple realizations of fracture networks mimicking fracture clustering and randomly distributed natural fractures. After incorporating hydraulic fractures, complex-fracture networks are obtained for further reservoir domain discretization. |To discretize the complex-fracture networks, a new mesh-generation approach is developed to conform to nonorthogonal and low-angle intersections of extensively clustered discrete-fracture networks with nonuniform aperture distribution. Optimization algorithms are adopted to reduce highly skewed cells, and to ensure good mesh quality around fracture tips, intersections, and regions of extensive fracture clustering. Moreover, local grid refinement is implemented with a predefined distance function to control cell sizes and shapes around and far away from fractures. Natural-fracture spacing, length, strike, and aperture distribution are explicitly gridded, thus introducing a new simulation approach that is far superior to dual-porosity simulation. Finally, initial sensitivity studies are performed to demonstrate both the capability of the optimization-based unstructured meshing algorithms, and the effect of aforementioned natural-fracture parameters on well performance. |This study demonstrates how to incorporate a fractal-based characterization approach into the current work flow for simulating unconventional reservoirs, and most importantly solves several issues such as nonorthogonal intersections, extensive clustering, and nonuniform aperture distribution associated with domain discretization with unstructured grids for complex-fracture networks. The proposed meshing techniques for complex fracture networks can be easily implemented in existing preprocessing, unstructured mesh generators. The sensitivity study and the simulation runs demonstrate the importance of fracture characterization as well as uncertainties associated with naturally fractured reservoirs on well-production performance.|","reservoir simulation, natural fractured reservoir, hydraulically fractured horizontal wells, unstructured grid, fractal theory"

Reservoir-simulation models play an important role in the production forecasting and field-development planning. To enhance their predictive capabilities and to capture the uncertainties in model parameters, one should calibrate stochastic reservoir models to both geologic and flow observations. |In this paper, a novel approach to characterization and history matching of hydrocarbon production from a hydraulic-fractured shale is presented. This new methodology includes generating multiple discrete-fracture-network (DFN) models, upscaling the models for numerical multiphase-flow simulation, and updating the DFN-model parameters with dynamic-flow responses. First, measurements from hydraulic-fracture treatment, petrophysical interpretation, and in-situ stress data are used to estimate the initial probability distribution of hydraulic-fracture and induced-microfracture parameters, and multiple initial DFN models are generated. Next, the DFN models are upscaled into an equivalent continuum dual-porosity model with analytical techniques. The upscaled models are subjected to the flow simulation, and their production performances are compared with the actual responses. Finally, an assisted-history-matching algorithm is implemented to assess the uncertainties of the DFN-model parameters. Hydraulic-fracture parameters including half-length and transmissivity are updated, and the length, transmissivity, intensity, and spatial distribution of the induced fractures are also estimated. |The proposed methodology is applied to facilitate characterization of fracture parameters of a multifractured shale-gas well in the Horn River basin. Fracture parameters and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) derived from the updated DFN models are in agreement with estimates from microseismic interpretation and rate-transient analysis. The key advantage of this integrated assisted-history-matching approach is that uncertainties in fracture parameters are represented by the multiple equally probable DFN models and their upscaled flow-simulation models, which honor the hard data and match the dynamic production history. This work highlights the significance of uncertainties in SRV and hydraulic-fracture parameters. It also provides insight into the value of microseismic data when integrated into a rigorous production-history-matching work flow.|","unconventional reservoirs, Dynamic data integration, microseismic, Hydraulic fracture characterization, Ensemble Kalman filter"

Similar permeability increases are found in other CBM basins around the world. Models previously advanced to explain this behavior combine a compaction mechanism (which closes cleats) with matrix shrinkage (which opens cleats). In this paper, the original model—Palmer and Mansoori (1996, 1998)—is extended to include the transversely isotropic elastic response found in vertically cleated coals. This new version of the model has been calibrated by laboratory measurements on San Juan basin coal loaded under uniaxial-strain conditions to simulate reservoir depletion. The main goal/result is a predictive model characterized by two measured Young’s moduli and three measured Poisson’s ratios. |Although there exist many models that seek to explain the huge permeability increases in CBM wells, the significance of this logical extension to the Palmer-Mansoori model (Palmer and Mansoori 1996, 1998) (i.e., the addition of coal anisotropy) is that it has the ability to predict permeability increases in wells in the field by use of measurable rock moduli and other quantities, thus reducing the need for empirically derived field matching parameters. Note that this new model also confirms an empirical constant that was invoked in a previous version of the Palmer-Mansoori model (Palmer and Mansoori 1996, 1998) to account for cleat anisotropy. To illustrate the model results, permeability increases with depletion from a few wells in one area of the San Juan basin have been matched by the new model. The new model should allow better forecasting of gas rates by reservoir simulators, as well as improved predictions of gas production in fields yet to be developed.|","production, depletion, coalbed methane, modeling, permeability increase"

Many shale-gas and ultralow-permeability tight gas reservoirs can have matrix-permeability values in the range of tens to hundreds of nanodarcies. The ultrafine pore structure of these rocks can cause violation of the basic assumptions behind Darcy's law. Depending on a combination of pressure-temperature conditions, pore structure and gas properties, non-Darcy flow mechanisms such as Knudsen diffusion, and/or gas-slippage effects will affect the matrix apparent permeability. |Even though numerous theoretical and empirical models were proposed to describe the increasing apparent permeability caused by non-Darcy flow/gas-slippage behavior in nanopore space, few literature sources have investigated the impact of formation compaction and the release of the adsorption gas layer upon shale-matrix apparent permeability during reservoir depletion. |In this article, we first present a thorough review on gas flow in shale nanopore space and discuss the factors that can affect shale-matrix apparent permeability, besides the well-studied non-Darcy flow/gas-slippage behavior. Then, a unified shale-matrix apparent-permeability model is proposed to bridge the effects of non-Darcy flow/gas-slippage, geomechanics (formation compaction), and the release of the adsorption gas layer into a single, coherent equation. In addition, a mathematical framework for an unconventional reservoir simulator that was developed for this study is also presented. |Different matrix apparent-permeability models are implemented in our numerical simulator to examine how the various factors affect matrix apparent permeability within the simulated reservoir volume. Finally, the impact of a natural-fracture network on matrix apparent-permeability evolution is investigated. The results indicate that, even though the conductive fracture network plays a vital role in shale-gas production, the matrix apparent-permeability evolution during pressure depletion cannot be neglected for accurate production modeling.|","Geomechanics, Permeability, Shale Gas, Non-Darcy Flow, Adsorption Layer"

Raggio, Petrobras| Ferreira, F. H., Petrobras","|Mechanical stability analyses are mandatory to identify suitable candidates for openhole completions. These analyses should comprehend the effects of production drawdown and reservoir depletion state anticipated by the production plan. The understanding and modeling of the physico-chemical interactions between rock and flown fluids and their impacts on the rock mechanical properties is imperative in the openhole stability analysis of wellbores drilled in carbonate reservoir rocks, especially in the wells subjected to acid stimulation. |This paper presents a methodology for determining the impact of stimulation jobs in the confined rock mechanical response and thus on the acidized wellbore stability. The authors briefly discuss the main rock dissolution patterns, ranging from compact dissolution to homogeneous, passing through the wormhole generation. The homogeneous dissolution pattern has been pursuit in the laboratory because of: i) absence of confident methods to anticipate which other pattern should be more dominant in a given scenario; and ii) Its highest impact on the mechanical properties, leading to safe analyses. |As a result, 24 samples from an off-shore carbonate reservoir have been mechanically tested. 13 of these have been tested after a massive dissolution. The initial effective pore volume and its evolution due to dissolution have been registered and were applied as a geomechanics indicator. The triaxial test results show that the rock softens during injection with impacts on its kinematic parameters. The ultimate rock strength, otherwise, remained almost unchanged. An analytical expression has been devised to map the porosity variations in the wellbore surroundings based on the acid job operational parameters. It indicates that the main failure behavior of a uncased wellbore subjected to acidizing jobs or non-native fluid flows should be related to excessive near wellbore rock straining rather than brittle failures. In this scenario, a standalone completion scheme would be preferable against the barefoot because of its ability to provide mechanical support to the altered rock at the borehole walls. |The current dissolution-induced rock weakening model presents a significant increase in the understanding on how the acid job affects the carbonate rock mechanical response, building a solid base for the well integrity analyses in the production phase.|","Well Integrity, Barefoot Completion, Acidizing, Rock Weakening"

F., Petrobras| Borba, A. M., Petrobras","|Sand production is a serious problem in many petroleum basins worldwide. It costs the oil and gas industry tens of billions of dollars annually. Additionally, uncontrolled sand production results in costly workover operations and, in some cases, can result in environment hazards due to the release of hydrocarbons associated with catastrophic wellhead and/or production equipment failure. On the other hand, if an unnecessary sand exclusion completion scheme is adopted in one well it will cause oil/gas production impairment and loss of oilfield revenue. Rock strength plays a main role in the analysis of sanding onset prediction. Regarding that subject, the in situ stress and the reservoir depletion are also important players. This article presents a sanding onset probabilistic analysis that takes into account the uncertainties associated to the determination of rock strength and in situ stress over the predicted bottom hole flow pressure at sanding onset. |In order to determine the sanding onset at a sandstone reservoir, the rock strength will be estimated in three distinct scales: small (uniaxial tests), middle (scratch test) and large (wellbore logs and correlations). According to this procedure, it is possible to scale up the rock unconfined compressive strength from lab to field. In parallel, the in situ stress was estimated considering leakoff tests, minifracs and wellbore logs. Finally, an analytical model is used to estimate the stress around the perforated tunnel. As design criterion, it is not permitted that the maximum hoop stress surpasses the formation effective strength (U). This mechanical rock property is related to the cavity strength registered in a hollow cylinder test. |Using this kind of methodology, in a pore pressure vs. bottom hole flow pressure diagram, failure probability contour maps for sandstones were generated for two of Petrobras' ultra-deep water fields. For the first analyzed field, previously to the analysis itself, wells have been completed with fracpack technology. After performing an analytical and experimental study using the proposed methodology, two wells (gas and oil) were completed in a conventional way. Up to this date both wells are producing without sanding. Throughout the article these wells will be called ""Well A"". The second field is still at the appraisal phase and wells have been drilled in order to estimate rock mechanical properties and in situ stress state with the purpose of minimizing the proposed methodology uncertainty. Based on this analysis, a long term well test will be performed without any sand exclusion equipment inside the well. Henceforth this well will be named ""Well B"". |The proposed methodology is an assemblage of an analytical simulation of stress around cavities and an experimental effort to estimate the unconfined compressive strength based on lab tests and wellbore logs in conjunction with empirical correlations.|","in situ stress state, lab test, sanding, rock mechanics, rock strength"

The resulting numerical model has been implemented as a standalone specialist 2D FE Simulator. The simulator provides the well design engineers a user-friendly interface upon which they can evaluate the effects of the wellbore and reservoir pressure changes, as well as the aforementioned rock weakening effects from an acidizing job, on the wellbore stability. |The mechanical wellbore response presented by the simulator elucidates how the stress and strain patterns change after an acid well stimulation job. Wellbores under virgin rock conditions tend to fail by localized plastified zones, also referred to as breakouts, whereas wells subjected to acidizing jobs present extensive straining due to rock weakening. The boundaries of the acidized zone encloses a much less rigid rock prone to deform and compact. On one side this compliant zone provides a gradual shear distribution along the well radius inside the formation and mechanical confinement to the surrounding intact rock and therefore helps this rock in supporting the stresses as if the wellbore were much larger. However, on the other side this significant weakened rock volume poses uncertainties about its own stability or solids production risks. The installation of a perforated or slotted liner/casing acting as a bearing element tends to hold this compliant material back and accounts for the material uncertainties and lack of model representativeness in terms of eventual preferential dissolution patterns. |The unprecedented results presented by the developed simulator are assisting the company on the standalone completion decisions and increasing the robustness of well completion designs, therefore assuring the perennity of the CAPEX.|","Rock Weakening, Numerical Simulation, Barefoot Completion, Well Integrity, Acidizing"

While exploring deeper water depths, large hydrocarbon deposits have been found below salt formations. These reservoirs are located in formations called ""pre salts"". Salt formations create favorable conditions for trapping hydrocarbons but also introduce challenges in well drilling and completion because of their mobile nature. The rock salts behave in a visco-elastic manner and deform under pressure. This deformation is called ""creep"" and occurs over time once the salt is disturbed. Creep begins the instant the drilling penetrates the salt formation and occurs because of instability and formation stresses. Completion of the well does not stop the creep process. This continual creep causes an increase in load on the casing and causes excess stress on the well completions during the lifetime of the well. Creep can eventually cause the casing to collapse. 
Poorly designed casing, centralizer placement against the salt formation, and the cement job can be at risk for casing collapse during production. Previous studies have demonstrated eccentricity can increase the stress load on casing dramatically in salt formations. To avoid eccentricity, the placement of centralizers in the salt formation is very important. Presently, there is no method for optimizing centralizer placement; hence, it remains a challenging problem. 
This study presents a geomechanical model, which treats the formation, cement, and casing as a whole system. The eccentricities of casing in wellbores having different borehole inclination and centralizer placement are derived from analytic solutions. The creep behavior of the salt formation and the stress load on the casing are calculated using the finite element method. The results of this model can be used as input parameters for optimum wellbore design, centralizer placement, and wellbore integrity analysis to predict the in-situ casing stress throughout the lifetime of a well. This paper also presents derivations of the generalized methodology for optimum placement of centralizers and the application of the model in a field case. Simulations examples have been performed and are reviewed in this paper. In addition, this paper documents the mathematical simulation results under different well profile and well geometry scenarios.|","Presalt, casing design, offshore, centralizer placement, deepwater"

P., ExxonMobil| Grave, E., ExxonMobil","|Increasing confidence and efficiency of process unit are major challenges for subsea field development. In such conditions, subsea liquid-liquid separation is still an important issue. Moreover, related to water depth, only compact separators with short residence times can be installed. The key point developed in this paper is to evaluate the water-oil separation regarding the oil properties including the effect of gas. A joint Industrial Program was performed in IFPEN on water separation efficiency in collaboration with Petrobras and ExxonMobil. |Experiment and numerical analysis of tests were performed on a facility platform. The GOwSP platform used is an industrial test facility designed to research and to test multiphase equipments. The closed loop is under pressure and temperature control to simulate real operating conditions. The material used is a crude oil supplied by Petrobras, synthetic brine and natural gas. The tests were performed in a horizontal separator unit implemented with specific instrumentation such as interface profiler gauge. The separation efficiency is calculated from flow mass balance. Various operating conditions were studied such as; gas and liquid flow rates, water fraction, temperature, pressure. Special attention was taken on pressure effect and gas/oil ratio. |Thus, a 1D model previously developed was used for tests simulation in order to predict the separation efficiency as a function of the operating production conditions. The 1D-model is based on an ""experiment-modeling"" methodology. The model is developed based on physical laws describing emulsion destabilization under only gravity effect and then it is extrapolated in case of fluid flows. Simulations shown a good accordance with experiment results. Whatever the conditions, most of simulation of the separation efficiency are within a 20% relative error margin. Classical behaviour of separation efficiency increase with oil residence time and temperature is confirmed as a decrease with initial water content increase. Simulations permitted to underline the important influence of oil characteristics viscosity, density on separation efficiency. At tested operating conditions, the gas had a slight influence on oil/water separation.|","Simulation, Liquid-liquid separation, Experiment, Sub-sea separation, Gas effect"

New electrostatic technologies have enhanced the dehydration and desalting processes for crude oil by increasing the electrostatic field strength of the treaters and improving treater hydraulics, allowing the use of compact and lighter equipment with a larger operating window. |Topsides processes on offshore platforms include a series of process vessels for oil / water / gas separation, with separate polishing processes for the separated gas and produced water phases. The wider the operating window and the higher the process efficiency for each process step, the fewer number of process steps is required and the more compact the separation train. |This paper describes a 2-pronge approach for the crude oil dehydration process, providing an increased operating window for more effective crude oil dehydrators and desalters. Thus fewer and more compact process vessels can be used while still maintaining the required process performance. The paper also includes special considerations for slosh suppression, instrumentation and operating procedures, in addition to case stories with examples of compact equipment installed on FPSOs, SPARs, TLPs and semi submersibles. |This 2-pronge approach for crude oil dehydration and desalting combines high bulk water removal efficiency in the initial step and a high dehydration efficiency in the second step, providing benefits including:  –  |an increased operating window in terms of crude oil inlet water cut and API gravity – |use of smaller and more effective electrostatic treaters with lower CAPEX  – |a reduced OPEX from lower operating temperature, reduced demulsifier dosage and less dilution water for desalting  |Further benefits include high frequency and amplitude modulated electrostatic fields, improved electrode configurations and materials, as well as improved fluid distribution inside the electrostatic treaters.|","Crude oil dehydration, AC-DC treaters, Offshore topsides, Improved operating range, Dual Frequency"

J., Petrobras| Alonso, A., Petrobras","|The Brazil ultra-deepwater, pre-salt application has been a very challenging drilling environment since exploration activity began in 2005. The initial pre-salt section contains limestone with random silicified nodules. Over the last few years, operators have collected large amounts of data for service companies to analyze to improve drilling performance through bit design. Using this information, a hybrid bit design with the most advanced cutter and bit technology was developed successfully increasing the distance drilled by 138% and the rate of penetration (ROP) by 171%. |Prior to advanced hybrid bit technology, a variety of other drill bit technologies such as polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits and impregnated designs were used in the pre-salt. Historically, impregnated bits had longer runs, but with high mechanical specific energy (MSE) and low ROP, drilling with these bits was not economical. Contrarily, PDC bits can deliver higher ROP but cannot drill as far as impregnated bits. Three hybrid designs, the last one using dual-chamfer technology, were brought into this application to reduce cost-per-meter through better drilling efficiency and ROP. Each successive design managed to exceed customer expectations. |Extensive laboratory tests were conducted on the hybrid designs to address the demanding needs of pre-salt applications. These unique bits showed promising results on atmospheric surface rig tests and in pressurized bottomhole simulator testing. Hybrid bits produced much less torque, with smoother torque fluctuations and faster ROPs than roller-cone and PDC bits through the simulated interbedded formations in laboratory testing. Novel dual-chamfer cutters used in the bit have been lab tested on a vertical turret lathe (VTL), a visual pressurized single-point-cutter (VSPC) test machine and a monotonic loading test. Cutter testing showed positive VTL results and increased resistance to diamond fractures. |Ultra-deepwater drilling is very demanding and expensive, so operators want to achieve total depth in just one run by avoiding trips to change out the bit or bottomhole assembly (BHA). The improved bit and cutter technology resulted in significant cost savings and confidence for the customer. The performance of the hybrid bit with dual-chamfer cutters was significantly better than offsets, saving the operator approximately USD 9769/m.|","Pre-Salt Drilling, Drilling Optmization, Novel PDC Cutters Improves, Hybrid Bit"

B., Petrobras","|In oilfield exploitation, pumping is one of the most productive artificial lift methods. The use of downhole pumps, where applicable, allows increasing production. However, service life of this type of systems may be short, around 2.5 years for electrical submersible pumps - ESPs, one of the most widely used types. Furthermore, failures in wet completion subsea wells require tubing removal, a heavy workover operation, demanding high costs offshore rigs. Besides, due to production halt, revenues are impacted. |As a tendency for subsea wells, whenever allowed by production conditions, pumps are installed on the seabed, outside the production well. Depending upon the free gas fraction at pump intake, ESPs (with or without previous gas separation) or multiphase pumps may be used. |Examples of ESP usage outside the producing wells are the pumping module (MOBO) and the Skid-ESP. In such cases, ESPs strings are installed on the seabed. In cases of failure, ESP replacement is simpler and faster, executed by rigs or special vessels, avoiding the costly intervention in the production well. But, even saving resources due to the operation simplification, the costs of required naval resources and the time spent awaiting for their availability and mobilization are still high. Several days may pass from system failure until the intervention is finally performed. |At Perdido and Nansen Spar platforms, operated by Shell and Anadarko respectively, ESP were deployed and installed in the production risers. Recent developments of compact and high speed ESP may contribute for their placement inside production risers for other production unit types, FPSO, for instance. |This paper proposes a new boosting concept based pumps, ESP or Hydraulic Submersible Pumps - HSP, installed inside production risers in FPSO, comparing their advantages and disadvantages of the proposed concept to seabed ESP systems, multiphase pumps and gas-liquid separation systems.|","Boosting, pump, Riser"

There are, however, associated risks in decreasing the size of separators. In particular, if the hydrocarbon liquid is supersaturated with gas and requires significant time to evolve, the liquid residence times inside the compact separator may be insufficient to allow the gas to completely evolve out of solution. The yet-to-evolve gas will continue in the exiting liquid stream and present itself as free gas further downstream. Excess amounts of free gas can seriously affect the reliability and performance of downstream equipment. The rate of gas evolution from flowing crude oil must be quantified to address this concern. Toward this end, an experimental program has been initiated in which the effects of pressure, temperature, fluid properties, and shear on gas evolution rate are evaluated in a 1 liter pressure vessel. The initial experiments will be conducted with air in water, with the intention of ultimately performing experiments on model and crude oils. Different agitation rates will be tested at pressures up to 200 psia.

The goal of this contribution is the introduction of a multinational research project aimed to the development of a novel concept for the utilization of associated petroleum gas (APG) using small-scale facilities located in remote areas in the Russian North. This project is funded by the ERA.Net RUS Plus program focused on the enhancement of the collaboration between European Union and Russia in the R&D area. It involves research institutions and companies from Russia, Germany and Poland and will be started in September 2015. The key step of the mentioned APG utilization route is the Syngas-to-Fuel (STF) process for the conversion of syngas into high-quality gasoline. One of the main challenges will be the selection of an appropriate technology for the syngas formation from APG, which is optimal adapted to the specific composition of APG usually containing (besides methane) higher hydrocarbons, CO2, N2, noble gases, sulfur-containing impurities, etc. The Russian-German-Polish project will be focused on the development of a comprehensive model for the overall process chain, including syngas generation, gas treatment, generation of heat and electricity, liquid fuels synthesis. Based on this model, technically viable and economically beneficial process integration schemes have to be defined taking into account the available infrastructure and the severe boundary conditions of the Russian North. For instance, a compact process design is desirable in terms of the reduction of capital costs. The final result of the ERA.Net RUS Plus project will be a technical and economical assessment of the novel technology for the APG utilization in remote areas, which is able to satisfy the needs of Russian oil and gas companies.|","Document Type

Some plays show very different behavior that has been attributed to pressure dependent permeability. Often, there are reported cases of shale wells that exhibit boundary dominated flow in a very short period that implies a stimulated rock volume (SRV) much smaller than would be expected based on the hydraulic fracture treatment design. This paper offers an alternative explanation for the early boundary dominated flow related to dissolution of salt-sealed natural fractures in the shale. Three plays are the target of this study, namely, the Haynesville shale, the Marcellus shale, and the Horn River Basin. |Flowback of water with significantly higher salinity than the injected fracture fluid may suggest that the injected low salinity fracturing fluid dissolved salts that seal an existing natural fracture system. Evidence would be seen in long-term transient rate and pressure production data as early boundary dominated flow providing the natural fracture pore volume dissolved by injected low salinity fracturing fluid that leaked off during the hydraulic fracture treatment. In this scenario, the effective permeability would represent that of the natural fracture system induced by salt dissolution, and the stimulated rock volume would be directly related to the leakoff volume. |This study first discusses a plausible diagenetic history for generation of a salt-sealed natural fracture system in shale gas and how core, log, and conventional test data may behave. We then present a material balance model for behavior of the salt-sealed fracture porosity, the shale matrix porosity, and fracture pore volume dissolved by the leaked off fracture fluid, during the fracture treatment and subsequent early and long term production. We show the resulting permeability loss as residual water vaporizes.

D., Stanford University","|During hydraulic fracture stimulation of the Middle Bakken Formation, many out-of-zone microseismic events are observed in the Mission Canyon Formation located ~ 800 ft above the Middle Bakken. These microseismic events follow an abnormal sequence, where the events are first located ~800 ft above the perforation location, followed by subsequent events moving downwards towards to the perforation location along an interpreted fault. We predict frac gradient variation in the vertical depth direction to investigate its relation to the unusual microseismicity. Using laboratory observed time-dependent behavior of rocks from the study field, we apply the viscous relaxation model to predict horizontal differential stress accumulation from geophysical logs. We further calculate two horizontal stress magnitude profiles from knowledge of the tectonic faulting constraint within the reservoir. The predicted least principal stress magnitude indicates that the Upper and Lower Bakken Formations are acting as weak frac barriers during hydraulic fracture stimulation in the Middle Bakken, while the Lodgepole and the Three Forks Formations above and below the Bakken Formation are not frac barriers. To compare the predicted stress values with the depth at which the out-of-zone seismicity occurs, we calculate the pore pressure perturbation (?P) required to cause slip along well-oriented fractures and faults as a function of depth. We find that the calculated ?P values match the microseismicity sequence: that is, the events occur first at depths that require the smallest values of pore pressure perturbation, and events of later stages are located at depths that require a much higher pressure perturbation. The stress profile calculated using a modified Eaton model does not capture the characters of the microseismicity. The calculated stress and ?P profiles indicate that the out-of-zone microseismic events are related to a combined contribution from preexisting fault and the lack of frac barrier above the Bakken Formation, while the abnormal sequence of these events are caused by variations of the stress state within the formations.|","Viscous Relaxation Model, Fracture Gradient Prediction, Out of Zone Microseismicity"

M., The University of Texas at Austin| Manchanda, R., The University of Texas at Austin","|The term induced un-propped (IU) fractures refers to fractures created around the main propped fracture which are too small to accommodate any proppant. These could include natural fractures, and micro-fractures induced along bedding planes or along other planes of weakness. Based on production data, diagnostic methods and field observations it is becoming increasingly clear that induced un-propped fractures created during the hydraulic operation play a critical role in determining the success of fracture treatments. |In this paper five independent pieces of evidence are presented to prove the existence of induced un-propped fractures in most wells under downhole conditions and to demonstrate their importance in production. These include: micro-seismic data, production history matching, tracer data, pressure communication between wells and finally calculations on the fate of the injected fracturing fluids. Examples are provided to clearly demonstrate how this information indicates the presence of IU fractures. |Once the existence of these fractures has been demonstrated simulations are conducted to show what role these induced un-propped fractures play during fracturing and during short-term and long-term production. It is shown that shale properties and the rheology and rate of injection of fracturing fluids plays an important role in the spatial extent and width of IU fractures. In some shales these fractures play a dominant role while in others they may be less important. |Finally recommendations are made for fracture design to account for the presence of these IU fractures. These recommendations have a large impact on important decisions such as well spacing, fracture spacing, fluid rheology, proppant loading, proppant size and other fracture design considerations. In many instances these recommendations would have been quite different had the presence of IU fractures not been recognized.|","SRV, history match, micro-seismic, tracer, Induced Unpropped Fractures"

Integrated approach with geological, geomechanical and petrophysical support is vital for successful extended reach drilling (ERD) in Yuri Korchagin field. 
Geological structure, represented by anticlinal fold, is characterized by variable formation dipping at the flanks. The field development is performed with the wells drilled from a stationary platform, located at the field crest. The main factor, determining the approach to the field development, is the relatively small thickness of the oil rim of 19.9 m, limited by fluid contacts. Hence, the objectives of planned net to gross ratio (NTG) and production rates can only be achieved by drilling ERD wells with the average measured depth of 4000 to 6500 m. 
It is hardly possible to precisely forecast structural behavior based purely on well to well correlation and seismic interpretation. Frequent lateral lithology variations and presence of faults represent additional uncertainties. Therefore, successful placement of the horizontal section within the target formation requires not only understanding of the position of the wellbore within the structure, but also real time evaluation of reservoir properties and fluid saturations. 
In order to reduce uncertainties in this complex geological environment, the innovative reservoir-scale mapping while drilling technology was utilized for the first time in Yuri Korchagin field. This technology provides an extensive set of deep directional electromagnetic (EM) measurements and has the radius of investigation, exceeding 30 m TVD from the wellbore. The inverted EM measurements are graphically represented as the 2D vertical section along the wellbore with the multiple layers resistivity visualization. The innovative technology, thanks to its large radius of investigation, enabled forecasting and detailed understanding of structural behavior of the target formations, confirmed the oil water contact (OWC) depth and allowed for detection of the faults and their displacement magnitude. Based on the interpretation of the data, obtained with the reservoir-scale mapping technology, the 3D geological model of the field was updated and refined, which served supplementary exploration purpose. 
At the greater depths, the risk of drilling accidents, associated with narrow safe mud weight window, is increasing. The ""well to formation"" equilibrium state is impossible without thorough geomechanical modeling and interaction with geology and engineering departments involved in drilling operations. The integrated support approach and utilization of the innovative reservoir-scale mapping while drilling technology enabled achieving excellent results. The record 8005 m MD well with 4895 m MD horizontal section was drilled. The horizontal section was drilled in a single run, mostly as a result of minimization of drilling in prone to collapse shaly intervals. The NTG achieved 88.5%, the record value in this field.|","Document Type

This project is funded by the ERA.Net RUS Plus program focused on the enhancement of the collaboration between European Union and Russia in the R&D area. It involves research institutions and companies from Russia, Germany and Poland and will be started in September 2015. The key step of the mentioned APG utilization route is the Syngas-to-Fuel (STF) process for the conversion of syngas into high-quality gasoline. One of the main challenges will be the selection of an appropriate technology for the syngas formation from APG, which is optimal adapted to the specific composition of APG usually containing (besides methane) higher hydrocarbons, CO2, N2, noble gases, sulfur-containing impurities, etc. The Russian-German-Polish project will be focused on the development of a comprehensive model for the overall process chain, including syngas generation, gas treatment, generation of heat and electricity, liquid fuels synthesis. Based on this model, technically viable and economically beneficial process integration schemes have to be defined taking into account the available infrastructure and the severe boundary conditions of the Russian North. For instance, a compact process design is desirable in terms of the reduction of capital costs. The final result of the ERA.Net RUS Plus project will be a technical and economical assessment of the novel technology for the APG utilization in remote areas, which is able to satisfy the needs of Russian oil and gas companies.|","Document Type

Consequently, various forms of brittleness indices have been introduced, in part, to decide where to place perforation clusters in multi-stage horizontal completions. These brittleness indices are often calculated using correlations between elastic parameters and mineralogical data, primarily because mineralogical information is readily obtained from wireline logs, cores, or cuttings. This presents two unresolved issues. First, while it is likely that a relationship between brittle failure and stiffness qualitatively exists, the efficacy of leveraging these indices in a quantitative manner remains uncertain. Second, there are limited examples comparing direct rock core measurements to indices calculated from mineralogical data, leaving room for ambiguity in what the magnitude of brittleness indices mean to hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation. |This study aims to clarify the definition of brittleness by comparing laboratory-derived rock mechanical properties, mineralogical and mechanical brittleness indices. Shales evaluated include the Floyd, Haynesville, Eagle Ford, and Barnett. Rock properties measured in this study are Young's modulus, Brinell hardness, tensile strength, and compressive strength. The mineralogical content of the specimens was determined by the x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. A mineral-defined brittleness index is computed from the XRD data, while the mechanical brittleness indices are computed from tensile and compressive strength testing of core from these shale formations. Results show little agreement among the mechanically based indices, but hardness measurement trends coincide with elasticity-based mechanical indices and mineralogical indices. Additional data is needed verify the possible relationship between tensile strength and mineralogy. Strong correlation exists between mineralogical-based brittleness and Brinell hardness in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shales. The Brinell hardness index could be applied in lieu of brittleness with the added benefit of estimating proppant embedment.|","Brittleness, Hydraulic Fracturing, Rock Mechanics"

In previous work, it has been shown that kernel ridge regression based machine learning is a promising tool to interpret pressure transients from a single PDG. Kernel ridge regression denoises and deconvolves the pressure signal efficiently and recovers the full reservoir behaviors. In this work, the machine learning framework was extended to two applications: multiwell testing and flow rate reconstruction. |The multiwell testing was formulated into the machine learning algorithm using a feature-coefficient-target model. The features were nonlinear functions of flow rate histories of all the wells. For each well, the features and the pressure target of this well were used to train its coefficients, which implicitly contain the information about the reservoir model and well interactions. The reservoir model can then be revealed by predicting the pressure corresponding to a simple rate history with the trained model. The multiwell machine learning model was demonstrated to be useful in several different ways, including artificial interference testing and reservoir pressure prediction at various well locations based on flow rate data only. |Flow rate reconstruction aims at estimating any missing flow rate history by using available pressure history. This is a very useful capability in practical applications in which individual well rates are not recorded continuously. A set of new features were developed as functions of pressure to model the flow rate. Coupled with kernel ridge regression, the developed features were tested on both synthetic and real data sets and demonstrated high prediction accuracy. The success of the rate reconstruction modeling also illustrates the flexibility of machine learning to different kinds of modeling, by adapting features and targets. |The models for both applications maintained the advantages of the machine learning based single well pressure interpretation in terms of the accuracy of prediction, computational efficiency and tolerance to noise.

The oil and gas industry in Russia started facing a complex problem of productivity decline from horizontal multi stage fracture completed wells drilled in the low to mid permeability reservoirs. To enhance hydrocarbon flow from these formations, aggressive production using artificial lift is supported with active water flooding. Nevertheless, operators have acknowledged that the horizontal well multi stage fracture (HW MSF) completions do not live to their expectations. 
The application of HW MSF completions started in 2008, but widespread acceptance followed several years later. Today, in Russia, about 300 horizontal wells are drilled and completed annually bringing the total number of HW MSF to more than 1200 wells. All these wells are potential candidates for re-fracturing treatments and re-completion, but while re-fracturing of vertical wells is a well proven success in Russia, the industry today has no clear understanding how to address the multitude of potential productivity difficulties in HW MSF. 
During the work published in this paper, the team has analyzed all the known potential engineering problems and technical risks and clearly defined the domains of further investigation and set recommendations on measurements that are needed to understand the impact of re-fracturing. The analysis was based on field measurements made, analytical calculation and numerical simulations, modeling in all details the key processes defining the productivity of HW MSF completions. The results indicate that pressure influenced stress changes in a mostly isotropic system and resulting fracture placement within the horizontal wellbore are key contributors to the complexity of the problem. 
The paper presented here is a genuine attempt for the industry streamline further search for solutions and novel methodology to effectively re-fracture the existing completion systems and bring these wells to profitable production.|",""

Although a large number of hydraulic fracturing operations have been performed in soft formations, the exact mechanisms of failure and fracture propagation remain an unresolved issue. Conventional hydraulic fracturing models based on the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) often lead to inaccurate results because large inelastic deformations and strong fluid-solid coupling are neglected in such models. |A fully three-dimensional hydraulic fracture growth model for soft sands is developed. Our model can simulate non-planar fracture growth in poro-elasto-plastic materials, fluid flow inside the fracture with proppant transport, and fluid leak-off from the fracture to the porous reservoir. This paper presents the formulation and implementation of a new model. The model is verified by comparisons with analytical solutions. The model predicts considerably higher net fracturing pressure due to plasticity, which is consistent with observations from the field and laboratory experiments. This is because the stress concentrations at the crack tip in a plastic material are lower than in an elastic material and the plastic yielding shields the tip from the fracturing pressure. This induces shorter and wider fractures than without plasticity. Also, fluid leak-off and the pore pressure diffusion in the reservoir are computed numerically in this model. Higher leak-off leads to a poroelastic backstress that builds up around the fracture and results in shorter fractures.|","Leak-off, Plasticity, Finite Volume Method, Cohesive Zone Model, Hydraulic Fracturing"

These unconventional resources have presented many challenges to the oil and gas industry. One of the biggest challenges for evaluators is to predict long-term shale production performance, especially in a timely and reliable manner. |For traditional reservoirs, the most common practice of reserve evaluation is Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), a method with decided advantages; it is not only the simplest and least time-consuming method, but it also accommodates the historical field uncertainties by honoring observed performance trends. However, applying the traditional DCA method to shale wells, engineers commonly encounter the difficulties of simultaneously matching the high initial production rate, the extremely sharp decline rate in the transient flow period, and the shallow decline resulting from boundary-dominated flow (BDF) in late-life. This suggests that traditional DCA may not be suitable for evaluating shale reservoirs. As a result, numerical simulation seems to be the best solution to provide reliable results but at the expense of extensive manpower, cost, time, and data requirements. |We propose an alternate DCA approach, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional DCA or numerical simulation, to estimate the recoverable hydrocarbons. We suggest that a mechanism of ""growing drainage volume"" is an excellent way to conceptualize and model the performance of shale wells. This paper presents a new extended exponential form of the production decline analytical equation. Three empirical depletion terms, <U+00DF>e, <U+00DF>l, and n, have been used in the equation. The parameter <U+00DF>e represents the early, sharp decline in the transient period immediately after the well is put on production; the <U+00DF>l parameter represents the comparatively shallow decline in late-life when the progress of ""growing drainage volume"" plays the dominant role on the production performance; the parameter n is an empirical exponent. The overall decline rate can be calculated by a relationship involving, <U+00DF>e, <U+00DF>l, n, and time t. Even though the new method is not always more accurate than peer models, it is likely as accurate, and does not require the analyst to guess when to switch to a boundary-dominated flow model nor to force a switch to exponential decline. |We have tested and verified this new empirical DCA by both extensive field data and detailed numerical simulation results for seven wells. For each of these data sets, the comparisons between traditional DCA methods, and in some cases simulations, indicate the relative advantages of this new approach. Later, we applied this method to over 2,000 wells in the Eagle Ford shale. The analysis resulted in a relatively symmetric distribution for the empirical parameter n.|","Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), Shale Reservoirs, Extended Exponential Model"

The Achimov formation of the Urengoy field are considered as a promising object that by 2020 will be able to provide about 10% of gas production in Russia. Because of the complex geological conditions and a high accident rate while horizontal drilling, deposit is mostly developed by S-shaped wells. In 2013 a number of new technologies and engineering solutions in the intervals penetrated into the Achimov deposits, has allowed to drill the first time successful well with the 1000 m horizontal section length. As a result of further optimization and implementation of new solutions for each interval of the well, it was able to significantly reduce construction time and increase economic efficiency of drilling. 
By collaborative efforts of the field operator, drilling contractor and oilfield services company was developed and optimized a drilling system for horizontal wells in the Achimov deposits, which included complex engineering solutions, technologies and workflows. Based on the geomechanical model was optimized drilling fluids density and rheological properties for each well section, as well as designed optimal well trajectories. For drilling performance increase there were introduced new bottomhole assemblies (BHA) with rotary steerable systems combined with positive displacement motors (PDM), selected their optimal combinations with new polycrystalline diamond (PDC) bits. With the use of a drilling process simulation package were selected optimal drilling regimes. To eliminate inefficient operations and risk mitigation, selection and evaluation of drilling and completion decisions were made within a single system. 
As a result, optimization of entire drilling system, allowed to increase drilling rate in the intervals of production and liner section more than two times through the increase of ROP, number of trips reduction and flat time optimization. Application of RSS in combination with PDM section, selection of its pair with PDC bit, application of oil based mud (OBM) with a lubricant, as well as the implementation of measures aimed at keeping wellbore in a stable state and effective hole cleaning practices, that helped to reduce BHA vibrations, stick and slip of BHA while drilling and increase rate of penetration (ROP) by 59-100%, and increase the service life of BHA components. Thus achieved the ability to drill each interval per one run. The average well construction time decreased by 30%, and the fastest well was delivered to the customer by more than 2 times quiker ahead of a plan. The implementation of this approach afforded to remove restrictions associated with complecations of horizontal drilling and introduce new options for their completion, allowing to increase productivity. 
As an experimental industrial tests on several wells was conducted a multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, the results significantly exceeded the previously achievable performance on initial flow rate. As a result, the operator revised its approach to the development of its license area in favor of horizontal wells, which offer a great promise in terms of improving efficiency of the deposits reserves development, as well as perspective of trial and introduction of new advanced technologies and solutions of well construction in Russia.|","Document Type

These studies were elementary level and focused on identifying a dominant mechanism of production. They did not consider, however, the interaction of the fractures with the shale matrices in detail. In the near wellbore environment the fracture is the crucial component of transport, whereas the matrix is the place for storage. In this paper, using a new in-house reservoir flow simulator, we introduce the nature of this interaction and show that the transport in the tight matrix can be induced by carefully designing the well completions and by operating under the optimum production conditions. |The simulator accounts for a hydraulic fracture coupled to shale matrix with an anistropic apparent permeability field, which is stress-sensitive and includes the effects of molecular transport phenomena. The fracture has a dynamic conductivity with a simple nonlinear deformation rule reflecting proppant embedment effect on the conductivity. Using a sector model, we predict short-term cumulative production trends. The results indicate that design of horizontal wells with multiple fractures should take into account the geomechanical and diffusional resistances associated with the gas transport in the matrices. Further, in-series nature of the production indicates that changes in fracture conductivity beyond its threshold value has negligible effect on the production trends. Therefore, production optimization efforts should instead focus to considerations to improve the flow rates in the matrix.|","matrix permeability, fracture permeability, shale"

The unconventional formations such as shales typically have permeability values in nano-Darcy range. It is not practical to measure the permeability of the shale samples by conventional steady state techniques because of very low flow rates and length of time required to reach the steady state condition. Therefore, unsteady state methods such as GRI and pressure pulse decay which have been extensively used to estimate permeability of the shale samples. However, the measured permeability values for similar samples by these techniques can differ by 3 orders of magnitudes. This large margin of uncertainty and non-uniqueness of the results can be attributed to the interpretations of the data obtained from transient techniques and reproducibility problems. Furthermore, the unsteady-state measurements are not performed under the reservoir effective in-situ stress and temperature which introduces more limitations. |This paper describes the design, construction, and application of a laboratory set up and test protocols for accurate and repeatable measurements of the rich organic shale porosity, permeability and sorption characteristics under reservoir stress conditions. The near steady-state measurements can be performed in minutes up to hours, depending on the characteristics of the sample. This allows the permeability measurements to be performed as many time as need to produce repeatable results. Furthermore, the absolute permeability of the sample can be calculated by applying the gas slippage (Klinkenberg) and/or gas double-slippage corrections. The monitoring of the flow rate during the experiment allows to determine when the sample is fully saturated (adsorbed or desorbed). Therefore, there is no need for gas sorption correction. |The paper also present the results of measurements on several Marcellus shale sample which clearly indicate that shale's porosity and permeability to a larger extent, are sensitive to stress and the stress impact on permeability is non-reversible. This could be attributed to flow of gas through micro-fractures, which do not contribute to porosity significantly. In addition, the analysis of the measurement results indicated that only gas double-slippage corrections can provide reliable values for the absolute permeability of the sample.

Hydraulic fracturing can be widely used for stimulation of gas condensate reservoirs not only in order to improve the Productivity Index (PI) of the well, but also to minimize the condensate banking effect and maximize recovery, therefore ultimate impact the economic success of the production enhancement operations. 
Understanding the parameters affecting adequate propped fracture geometry is critical to the process. While none or limited influence can be exercised on the hydraulic fracture geometry from the reservoir side, the fracturing materials and the pumping technology at large, now on the disposition to the frac design engineer have ever been improving and will define the level of achievement. 
The general statement valid for mid perm reservoirs of high pore pressure and relatively high reservoir temperature, that it is very important to create a fairly long and clean, conductive propped fractures is not sufficient, in reservoirs where condensate banking represent a potentially important pressure loss. 
To counter the effects caused by pressure depletion below dew point that are resulting in multiphase flow and condensate bank creation in the reservoir, maximum conductivity fractures are designed. Further, depending on the drawdown and induced flow rate to the wellbore, non-Darcy effects, flow convergence and proppant damage can be potentially encountered; hence, fractures designed under the concept of ""maximizing conductivity"" will additionally decrease the well productivity decline. 
The analysis presented in the paper was based on a combination of data obtained from field measurements, analytical calculation and numerical simulations, modeling in all details the key processes defining the productivity gas condensate reservoir. The first results obtained indicate that the placement of extremely conductive fractures has a definite advantage in both productivity as well as in recovery of liquid hydrocarbons. 
To conclude – it can not be overemphasized that ensuring good conductive fractures that will ensure minimum pressure drop from multiphase, or non-Darcy flow is critical. Excellent wellbore connectivity by wide and conductive near wellbore fracture paths and maximizing inflow area and minimizing convergence flow effect is not to be underestimated too. The fracture design has to ensure this environment in the initial production phase as well as in years to come when reservoir pressure drop is expected and higher effective stress, proppant crush, fines migration and embedment, are placing additional strain on maintaining the fracture conductivity.|",""

This paper describes several new analytical and semi-analytical models to simulate and quantify abnormal leakoff behaviors such as tip extension, pressure dependent leakoff (PDL), multiple apparent closures and transverse storage. |Based on material balance, we model pressure change with time considering the fracture geometry and leakoff volume under various leakoff mechanisms.

In this case study, a rapid-deployment well placement workflow is implemented where geological, geophysical, geomechanical and petrophysical parameters were integrated using seismic and well data from a basin in China. The overall goal of the integrated workflow was making the best use of available data to reduce uncertainties and improve field development. More specifically the workflow was focused on best placement of a horizontal well trajectory to maximise reservoir exposure and optimizial orientation for fracturing to increase production. |Integrated technology enables improved drilling efficiency, which reduces nonproductive time, better reservoir definition and management, decreases uncertainties, increases production and improves the direct and intangible interpretation of seismic data so as to interpret meaningful geological boundaries. The primary challenge was to predict an optimized seismic well trajectory amid limited a priori information. Available image logs in addition to geological, petrophysical and geophysical information are interpreted independently and then integrated into a conceptual geological model. A model-based seismic inversion algorithm was implemented to predict acoustic impedance (AI). To predict porosity from AI, a linear relationship between impedance and neutron porosity was established and applied to impedance volume. A geomechanical model was developed for the field, which provided the reservoir pressure, in-situ stresses and rock properties to predict the optimal well trajectory. An optimum mud weight program was designed to drill the well with minimum non-productive time. |The image lithofacies method was compared with core photographs and open-hole logs. Image log analysis shows that the reservoir comprises a series of amalgamated meandering channels and crevasse splays separated by layers of fine sediments that act as local seals.

Post- stack seismic and well impedance was used to derive a best fit wavelet that results in quantitative measures of synthetic to seismic goodness-of-fit and wavelet accuracy. In conjunction with geomechanical models, integrated interpretation of predicted AI and porosity was used to optimize the drilling location. The seismic amplitude time slices generated at the top of the target show a wide zone of amplitude anomalies corresponding to the meandering channels interpreted from the image log analysis.

The Montney shale formation is very challenging to drill conventionally and has the potential for drilling into high pressure fractures which may contain sour gas. The overall objective consisted of using a lower density synthetic base mud system to optimize the ROP, thereby saving on overall drilling costs by reducing the number of drilling days and also drill the well safely due to the possibility of high pressure fractures and potentially sour gas. The main challenge was to increase ROP while still maintaining a constant bottomhole pressure to prevent any gas inflow into the wellbore. |In order to optimize drilling efficiencies and save on drilling time, advanced MPD technology was applied in combination with a low density (770 kg/m3) synthetic based mud while holding surface back pressure (SBP) in dynamic and static conditions to maintain a constant bottomhole equivalent circulating density (ECD). The system's annular pressure control mode was used to hold a desired ECD at a pre-determined position within the wellbore; In this case the heel was chosen. Constant bottomhole pressure operations were maintained throughout the entire project. The desired ECD was achieved and the well was kept at balance with the pore pressure. The advanced MPD system also provided the ability to monitor, detect and control an influx at the bit much earlier than conventional MPD and drilling systems which provided additional safety to the location. While drilling conventionally the ROP was extremely slow averaging 3.32 m/hr. The results greatly improved using advanced MPD technology with average ROP's between 7.4–10.5 m/hr. |This application also brought value to the project by reducing mud costs, increasing overall ROP as compared to conventional offset ROP data, maintaining constant bottomhole pressure with flexibility to adjust pressures as the well dictated, increasing safety through detection and control of micro influxes while drilling, reducing bits used as compared to conventional offset bit record data and minimizing any gas to surface. Achieving the goal of increasing the ROP and safely drilling the well to TD reduced the number of drilling days by at least 13 days, thereby reducing the overall AFE of the well. |This paper will include engineering analysis of the project compared to offset data along with graphs and tables.

Several years ago the Chernyshev swell was regarded as one of the most promising areas for petroleum exploration in the Timan Pechora basin. This was mainly due to an outcome of drilling of a 1-Vorgamusur well which targeted a new exploration play related to a subthrust zone. The well encountered an oil zone which yielded an uncontrollable oil blowout. Consequently a serious interest of oil and gas companies aroused. They rushed to secure prospective acreage on the newly established trend. Since then significant exploration efforts, including new seismic acquisition and drilling of several wells, have failed to deliver commercial volumes of hydrocarbons. As a result, prospectivity of the area has been downgraded and much of the exploration acreage was relinquished. The failure was explained mainly with poor qualities of reservoirs and unfavorable preservation conditions related to intense faulting resulting in breaching of seals. 
A critical review of G&G data suggest that the unsatisfactory outcome of the past exploration may to a large extent reflect shortcomings in the understanding of regional geology and inadequate technical solutions, rather than scarcity of oil and gas endowment of the Chernyshev swell. A reinterpretation of the regional structural geology provides vital clues for understanding the reasons of the past failures and permits the identification on new potentially high-impact opportunities.|","Document Type

J., The University of Texas at Austin| Gala, Deepen P., The University of Texas at Austin| Sharma, Mukul M., The University of Texas at Austin","|The effective placement of proppant in a fracture has a dominant effect on well productivity. Existing hydraulic fracture models simplify proppant transport calculations to varying degrees and are often found to over-predict propped or effective fracture lengths by 100 to 300%. A common assumption is that the average proppant velocity due to flow is equal to the average carrier fluid velocity, while the settling velocity calculation uses Stokes' law. To accurately determine the placement of proppant in a fracture, it is necessary to rigorously account for many effects not included in the above assumptions. |In this study, the motion of particles flowing with a fluid between fracture walls has been simulated using a coupled CFD-DEM code that utilizes both particle dynamics and computational fluid dynamics calculations to rigorously account for both. These simulations determine individual particle trajectories as particle to particle and particle to wall collisions occur and include the effect of fluid flow and gravity. The results show that the proppant concentration and the ratio of proppant diameter to fracture width govern the relative velocity of proppant and fluid. Further, the dependencies of settling velocity on apparent fluid viscosity, proppant diameter and the density difference between the proppant and fluid predicted by Stokes' law were found to apply. However, additional effects have been quantified and shown to substantially alter the predictions from Stokes' law. Proppant concentration and slot flow Reynold's number were both shown to modify the settling velocity predicted by Stokes' law, as does the ratio of proppant diameter to slot width. The effect of leak-off was found to be negligible in terms of altering either the settling velocity or the relative velocity of proppant and fluid. The models developed from the direct numerical simulations have been incorporated into an existing fully 3-D hydraulic fracturing simulator. This simulator couples fracture geomechanics with fluid flow and proppant transport considerations to enable the fracture geometry and proppant distribution to be determined. Unlike all previous studies, these effects are included together and so are shown to be inter-dependent, allowing us for the first time to accurately model proppant transport. |As noted above, proppant velocities have been accurately determined without simplifying approximations and with all relevant effects included, showing inter-dependence between the different effects. Two engineering fracture design parameters, injection rate and fluid rheology, have been varied to show the effect on proppant placement in a typical shale reservoir. This allows for an understanding of the relative importance of each and optimization of the treatment to a particular application.|","computational fluid dynamics, hydraulic fracture, finite element method, proppant transport, discrete element method"

As part of the field development plan Novatek, Russia's largest independent natural gas producer, recently planned an extended reach drilling (ERD) campaign at the Yurkharovskoye field, in the northern part of Western Siberia, Russia. The focus of this campaign is the development of an offshore part of the field from onshore locations using ERD techniques and implementation of new systematic approach - specific combinations of the drilling technologies, engineering and organizational solutions. 
Developed a new drilling program based on engineered drilling system (EDS) approach. Geomechanical model was created to address main challenges related to wellbore stability. Key drilling and measurement technologies, including multipole sonic-while-drilling, high-speed telemetry, multifunction logging-while-drilling technologies in combination with rotary steerable technology, polycrystalline diamond compact bits and oil-based drilling fluid were used to deliver superior drilling performance and control drilling regimes in real time. Another specific of this project was multilateral completion at TAML (Technology Advancement for Multi-Laterals) level 3 junction and the deepest casing exit from 178-mm string alone with the first in mainland Russia run of LWD tools for the direct formation pressure measurement while drilling. 
Four extended reach wells were drilled in this Yurkharovskoye ERD campaign with outstanding results in performance. Use of most advanced and superior technologies allowed setting several records for entire mainland Russia and to successfully drill and complete the longest ERD and longest multilateral ERD wells. A new approach in interaction between all participants in the project and engineered technological solutions as part of integrated drilling system was successfully implemented on all wells acknowledging its effectiveness in improving project performance and elimination of undesired incidents. Geomechanical model updated in real time was crucial in defining safe operational drilling parameters and regimes, together with precise drilling-fluid management, enabled rapid response to actual well conditions (i.e., fracture gradients, wellbore stability, hole cleaning and high torque) while drilling. Use of special casing milling system allowed performing whipstock orienting and casing exit in one run with full-size window at high inclination and long departure from surface. Well construction and production objectives were successfully archived and led to changes to the field development plan including planning new ERD wells for shallower pay zones on the field. 
This paper will describe how multidisciplinary well design and construction team addressed drilling challenges in variety of extended reach horizontal wells in Yurkharovskoye oilfield. Achieved results of new approach for complex technical projects will be presented; lessons learned and plans for future field development will be described.|","Document Type

However, a model reconstructed from the reduced parameters may often be distorted from prior geological information, especially when discrete facies indicator presents in the model; for example, a reconstructed ""channel"" does not look like a channel. This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) method that learns prior geological information/data, and then reconstructs a model after pluri-principal-component-analysis (pluri-PCA) is applied. The main steps of the methods are: first, a dictionary of object-based channelized geological models is generated based on the prior geological data/information. A pluri-PCA approach is applied to reduce the dimensions of grid-based static model and to convert the facies models to Gaussian PCA-coefficients. Second, the PCA coefficients are tuned during history matching process and the pluri-Gaussian rock-type-rule is applied to reconstruct the complex geological facies model from the tuned coefficients. Finally, a ML technique called ""Piecewise Reconstruction from a Dictionary"" (PRaD), which is based on the Markov Random Field method, is introduced to minimize the feature distance between the reconstructed model and the training models. In order to enforce geological plausibility, the facies models are reconstructed or regenerated by putting together pieces from different patches in the training realizations. |An AHM workflow with the above described new method has been applied to a real turbidite channelized reservoir. The prior geological model indicates that there is clear sand deposition between a gas injector and oil producers. However, one of the production wells has been observed much less gas production than simulated result. Without adding the plausiable additonal fault, the AHM results convinced that the reasonable match on gas production can only be achieved by changing channel orientation and shales/facies distribution. In addition, the new method is observed to preserve both channel features and geostatistics of the model parameters (e.g. facies, permeability, porosity). The additional uncertainties in dynamic aspects (e.g. aquifer strength, relative permeability multipliers, etc.) will be included in AHM workflow and addressed by a derivative-free optimization approach. |The new method is able to leverage the prior information provided by geologists in order to produce a non-Gaussian geologically plausible facies model that matches the observation data. While the pluri-PCA reconstruction process helps to preserve the major features and facies fraction within the geological model description, the PRaD method recaptures the missing details of minor features and enables the final model to closely link to the training realizations. Unlike the conventional approach, e.g. adding artificial flow barrier, this method renders the whole history matching workflow applicable to practical problems. In summary, the proposed method can further enhance the quality of the model reconstructed from a training dictionary of geological models.|","Machine Learning, Geological Facies, Assisted History Matching, Markov Random Field, Principal Component Analysis"

A., Hess Corporation","|Material-balance (MB) analysis for in-place volume estimation in gas reservoirs has been in practice for decades. Nonlinear responses from geopressure reservoirs with or without aquifer influx present special interpretation challenges. One of the main challenges of in-place volume estimates involves the estimation of average-reservoir pressure with production. To that end, modern pressure sensors installed at bottomhole and/or surface largely help establish a given well's dynamic performance by way of rate-transient analysis. |This paper explores the applicability and limitations of the standard analytical tools in volumetric, geopressure, and waterdrive systems for a diverse array of fluids, from dry gas to near-critical gas/condensate. The systematic approach presented in this paper attempts to increase accuracy in results by ensuring consistency in solutions from multiple methods used to first assess the average-reservoir pressure from production performance data, followed by in-place volume estimation. In this context, we examined analytical tools, such as the pav/z vs. cumulative gas production (Gp) plot, and cumulative reservoir voidage vs. cumulative total expansion plot. Both pot aquifer and unsteady-state Carter-Tracy aquifer models were considered to account for water influx. Besides the use of Cole and drive indices plots, two diagnostic log-log plots are introduced involving total expansivity and change in average-reservoir pressure. In addition, we sought solution objectivity by introducing a diagnostic tool in the Walsh and Yildiz-McEwen MB plots. Both MB methods involve plotting of cumulative reservoir voidage (F) vs. cumulative total expansion (Et), whereas the diagnostic tool consists of plotting F/Et vs. Et on the same graph. |Initially, synthetic data helped us understand the overall system behavior and instilled confidence in the solutions obtained for various combinations of drive mechanisms. Statistical design of experiments prompted us to explore independent variables, such as aquifer-to-hydrocarbon PV ratio, production rate, degree of overpressure, and the aquifer source.

Through its deployment, costly lost circulation events may be avoided, casing setting depths may be extended, and, in optimum cases, deeper targets may be reached with a reduced or slimmed-down casing program. |The elevation of the fracture gradient offered by WBS is a complex issue that involves the growth of fractures in permeable or impermeable rocks using non-Newtonian drilling fluids that are laden with solids of varying types and sizes. Several plausible (and sometimes contradictory) models have been proposed historically to explain the WBS phenomenon, and the only way to assess the correct explanation is through dedicated experimentation. In this paper, an experimental technique to study WBS under realistic conditions is introduced, and the results of a series of larger-scale fracturing experiments using this technique are presented. |The experimental set-up described here consists of a dual flow-loop/ pressure-intensifying system to carry out high-pressure borehole fracturing tests on cylindrical rock samples while maintaining continuous circulation of the drilling fluid within the borehole. The system offers full control over pore pressure, radial confining pressure and, if desired, independent axial pressure. Several injection cycles are performed to characterize the values of the fracture initiation pressure (FIP) and fracture propagation pressure (FPP) and thereby characterize WBS effects. Typical experimental variables included: the type of base fluid (water-based, oil- or synthetic-based), the concentration, type, and particle size distribution (PSD) of lost circulation materials (LCMs) used to achieve WBS effects, and the type of rock tested (sandstone and shale, i.e. permeable and impermeable rock media). Additionally, post-fracturing techniques such as thin-section analysis were employed to study the fracture geometry and deposition structure of plugging solids on the fracture surfaces. |The experiments clearly show that for any rock with a given set of rock strength and failure parameters, there is an optimum PSD for maximizing WBS effects. Optimum PSD appears to be of primary importance, almost irrespective of LCM type. The results furthermore show that although a minimum concentration of LCM bridging agents is required for effective WBS, FPP does not increase significantly for concentrations above a certain upper threshold value. Moreover, increasing the injection volume during WBS squeeze treatments above a threshold value may actually lead to lower FPP values. All of these findings have important implications for field application of WBS treatments. In addition, petrographic imaging of the fracture after testing show that fracture plugging occurs in the proximity of the fracture tip and not close to wellbore face, in direct support of the Fracture Propagation Resistance (FPR) model of WBS, and in disagreement with Wellbore Stress Augmentation/ Stress Cage models. |The results not only confirm information from previous investigations, but also provide new insight into effective ways to strengthen wellbores in various formations. The experimental results are directly applicable to improve well construction and to minimize non-productive time on narrow drilling-margin wells such as (ultra-) deep-water wells by selecting the appropriate mud formulations, LCM materials and their concentrations, as well as application treatments.|","Wellbore Strengthening, Large-Scale Fracturing Experiments, Fracture Propagation Pressure, Optimum Lost Circulation Material"

Porosity is essential for estimating original oil/gas in place and for calculating saturation and permeability. For naturally fractured reservoir (NFR) simulation, when matrix porosity is negligible, it is important to estimate proper fracture porosity and permeability in order to obtain more accurate simulation results. However, it is difficult to measure and estimate these parameters because of numerous factors, such as high heterogeneity of fluid and fracture properties, a scale difference between sampling window and real reservoir domain, and so on. |In a previous study (Kim and Schechter 2009), a fractal discrete fracture network (FDFN) codes were developed to generate discrete fracture network distributions and to calculate fracture porosity based on outcrop map, core sample and/or image log data. Because it was almost impossible to understand reservoir conditions from limited surveying data, fractal theory was adopted to reduce scale discrepancy errors in simulations. Each generated fracture had constant aperture distribution or normal/log-normal aperture distribution. The aperture distribution characteristics could describe natural like aperture properties. The code directly calculated fracture porosity using generated FDFN geometry data. |In this study, we developed codes to estimate the equivalent permeability distributions of large numbers of fractures using a modified Oda's algorithm. A modified Oda's algorithm reflected the heterogeneous nature of fracture networks using the full tensor permeability scheme. Because we used fractal and statistical methods to generate the fracture networks, the generated fracture geometries could have been different, even though same input data were used. Therefore, to generate reliable fracture network results with given input data, we performed FDFN codes 1000 times, using a Monte Carlo simulation. Then, generated fracture numbers and fracture density were calculated. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of generated fractures was calculated, and P10, P50 and P90 of the fracture networks were estimated. We selected the P50 case as reservoir fracture map. Simulated FDFN data of P50 map were passed to a modified Oda's algorithm, and x and y directional equivalent permeability distributions were calculated. We also developed iteratively coupled fluid flow and geomechanics codes, and simulated the fluid flow in porous media and estimated the interaction effects between two models. With calculated equivalent permeability data, two-phase fluid flow in porous media was first solved by finite difference methods (FDM), and then the calculated pore pressure data were passed to an elasto-plastic geomechanics model to calculate stress/volumetric strain of each element using finite element methods (FEM). The iteration was repeated until the convergence level was below the desired tolerance level and we estimated the interaction effects between fluid flow and geomechanics on reservoir simulation.

However, according to field analysis of stimulation effectiveness, only a small percentage of perforation clusters contribute to most of the well production. One reason for this low effectiveness is that multiple fractures do not take the same amount of fluid and proppant due to fracture interaction (i.e., stress shadow effects). Unfortunately, how best to minimize the negative effects of stress shadowing is still poorly understood in the petroleum industry. In this paper, we analyzed this problem in order to promote more uniform fracture growth using our complex hydraulic fracture development model. |We employed our fracture propagation model that couples rock deformation and fluid flow in the fracture and horizontal wellbore. Partitioning of flow rate between multiple fractures was calculated by analogizing to the electric circuit network. Fracture development is dominated by flow rate distribution, which is controlled by flow resistance within the fractures. For simultaneous multiple fracture propagation, non-uniform flow rate distribution is induced because stress shadow effects exert additional flow resistance on the interior fractures. To balance the extra resistance introduced by the effects, we investigated two adjustment approaches to promote uniform fracture development. The first approach was to adjust perforation number or diameter to increase flow resistance entering the exterior fractures. The second was to mitigate stress shadow effects through managing non-uniform fracture spacing. We found that decreasing perforation diameter or numbers of the exterior fractures can divert fluid into the interior fractures and promote even fracture growth. Stress shadow effects can be mitigated by moving the two interior fractures away from each other and toward the exterior fractures. The key mechanism is to maintain even flow resistance within each fracture and facilitate fractures to obtain the same amount of injection fluid. Furthermore, flow resistance is affected by near-wellbore fracture tortuosity, natural fractures, and stress heterogeneity in the reservoirs. These factors might also be effectively controlled by adding extra flow resistance to pass perforations, provided that this extra resistance is larger than the extra resistance introduced by the factors. |This work analyzes the problem of uneven development of multiple fractures along the horizontal wellbore and provides new insights into how to control simultaneous multiple fracture propagation. It offers potential approaches for engineers to apply in the field to optimize hydraulic fracturing treatment design and thereby maximize well production cost-effectively.|","displacement discontinuity method, limited entry technique, stress shadow, uniform development, complex hydraulic fracture propagation model"

As the development of hydrocarbon from shale resources increases exponentially globally, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the key variables for evaluating shale reservoirs and to define the best methods for effectively stimulating wells. However, this is not easy considering that each tool has both advantages and drawbacks with respect to technical, methodological, and economic matters. That is why, for shale projects, it is necessary to know the vital variables to optimize the collection of information, costs, and, of course, the validity of final results and interpretations. 
For initial characterization, reference information from previously fractured horizontal wells in the same formation should be considered and a holistic approach using characterization from petro-physical, geomechanical, mineralogy, and geochemical analysis should be considered during the determination of the best zones to be fractured. Analysis and use of diagnostic fracture injection testing (DFIT) and minifrac testing is also to be reviewed for the final calibration of fracture models before execution of the operation. Interpretation of micro-seismic monitoring during fracturing has great importance for obtaining models to optimize completions of wells and the development of a reservoir after an initial approach. 
This work analyzes and evaluates different sources of information and studies performed. Several factors and effects during the design stage are presented, such as using regional stress studies to estimate possible interference between the fracture stages and its effect on final fracture space determination. 
All in all, using this information is recommended for the initial approach during fracture design for the first wells in a new formation, proving to be a novel methodology to optimize and accelerate the development of a basin that can be applied later to following wells, helping save both time and resources.|","Petrophysics, Shale, Unconventional, Fracturing"

Drilling through narrow window between pore and fracture pressure using Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) approach requires precise hydraulic designs and pressure control plans to achieve drilling to target depth safely in timely manner which require accurate hydraulic model on pressure changes behavior along the borehole. 
This paper presents a case study where a non-isothermal hydraulic model was validated using field data from successful Deepwater MPD well in Offshore East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The validation considers all relevant hydraulic parameters such as bottom-hole pressure, equivalent circulating density, circulating friction and surface back pressure. The hydraulic modelling validation results are important in order to determine the non-isothermal hydraulic simulator behavior against actual field data for continuous improvement for future MPD operation. 
The validation confirmed the previous theoretical estimations that mud density and annular friction considerably depend on dynamic annular temperature profile. The work revealed that using a field-proof non-isothermal hydraulic model plays critical role in order to gather accurate BHP control in MPD operations. 
During the MPD operations, employing real-time hydraulic model validated by PWD data will improve the dynamic pressure control during the operation, the accuracy, and reliability of the hydraulic simulation results.

Well integrity has an utmost importance for upstream operations that has resulted in many studies to improve zonal isolation. Few papers comprehensively investigated the elements involved in cementing service delivery that are conducive to both well integrity and zonal isolation for extreme high temperature conditions. Geothermal, High Temperature and High Pressure, Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) (also known as Steam Flood) and Fire Flooding are all examples where the cement sheath can experience extreme high temperatures. 
This study emphasizes on sustainable zonal isolation throughout the life of wells facing extreme high temperatures. The purpose of this paper is to present the challenges of extreme high temperature cementing and show solutions used to assure cement integrity under such extreme environments. These challenges were reviewed and the most up to date solutions were discussed. The examples explained through this paper demonstrate the role of these critical elements for safe and environmentally friendly extreme high temperature well cementing.

With further progress of oilfields development in China, more and more ultra-low permeability oil reservoirs are being put into production. However, in ultra-low permeability oil reservoirs, pore throats are small and the specific surface area is big. Fluid always has a slow seepage velocity and the relationship between the seepage velocity and driving pressure is a curve, not a straight line. Fluid flow in low permeability porous media does not obeys Darcy's law any more, so traditional well testing interpretation methods may cause error in estimation of ultra-low permeability oil reservoir parameters. 
This paper describes problems encountered when analyzing transient pressure tests in ultra-low permeability oil reservoir. The equation to describe the non-Darcy's flow was given according to theoretical derivation and experimental method, and three factors were introduced into the equation to improve the Darcy's law. Based on the new model, the theoretical well test model for dual-porosity media in ultra-low permeability oil reservoirs with complex fractures was derived which allows for the influence analysis of non-Darcy's effect. By using Laplace transform and Fourier transform, the model was solved by analytical solution and numerical method. The analytical solution obtained is accurate and simple by contrast numerical method results. Besides, the curves for the pressure responses were plotted. The effects of parameters including fracture width, fracture length and the position of the fracture on the pressure were fully investigated in detail. The advantage of the solution is easy to incorporate storativity ratio and skin factor. It can also reduce the amount of computation and compute efficiently and quickly. Sensitivity analysis shows that non-Darcy flow mainly affects the transition section between the pure wellbore storage and radial flow region, and the pressure derivative curves exhibit a gentle transition region compared with the Darcy's flow. These type curves give a better interpretation of well testing pressure response in ultra-low permeability oil reservoir.|","numerical method, nonlinear flow model, tight gas reservoirs, analytical solution"

Wellbore instability remains a leading threat to oil operators as one of the main causes of non-productive time worldwide. As drilling technology advances, logging-while-drilling (LWD) measurements contribute valuable information to help identify instability problems in real time. One of the important measurements is the LWD ultrasonic caliper measurement, which makes it possible to identify borehole washout, breakout, keyseating, and spiral-hole conditions. Having this measurement enables diagnosis of wellbore stability problems while drilling without the need for an additional logging run, which is especially critical in an unstable wellbore. 
In the industry, breakout identification using image data can be a significantly user-dependent process and requires appropriate skills. The process is time consuming, and the final result can still be subjective. Further complication comes when considering a highly deviated well path or when the field stress regime is abnormal. As a consequence, drillers face difficulties using the LWD ultrasonic caliper data directly for wellbore stability diagnosis. We propose a methodology to overcome the limitation of conventional method and produce reliable quantitative breakout data to be used in real time, in an automated, systematic, and consistent way. 
An engineering-based workflow is introduced to distinguish zones of stress-induced breakouts from other borehole enlargement types with improved consistency and which can be easily translated into programming language. Instead of image data, this solution uses sector data to extract the borehole shape information using the cubic spline method. Six stringent LWD ultrasonic caliper-specific breakout criteria are introduced and used to identify breakout intervals from the borehole shape data. 
Adopting the idea from the World Stress Map (WSM) project, a data quality ranking was also performed using the result of the workflow. The quality ranking criteria (defined by WSM project) segregate the breakout results into five categories to infer the reliability of the breakout intervals identified. This quality ranking procedure will greatly improve the reliability of the output data in the workflow prior to quantitative usage. The result of the breakout identification is then used to determine the principle stress direction and the stress regime, using a 3D stress analysis method for deviated wells.|","Borehole Breakout Formation, Stress Estimation, Stress Regime, LWD Ultrasonic Caliper, Breakout Criteria"

Soft rocks, such as rock salt, claystone-gypsum, and gypsum, can cause tremendous dangers to wellbore wall surrounding rock deformation and damage. These rocks are the key to predict in-situ stress more accurately in ultra-deep composite salt-gypsum formation and ensure the safety of casing design after drilling or well completion. Therefore, a new method to predict in-situ stress in ultra-deep composite salt-gypsum formation needs to be established. 
To date, existing in-situ stress experimental methods are unsuitable for salt-gypsum formation; these methods need in-situ stress data to design drilling and completion casing strength to ensure casing safety in salt-gypsum formation. To solve such problem, this study measured the in-situ stress of rock salt-gypsum for the first time by deformation rate analysis (DRA)–Kaiser method. Results showed that combining DRA and Kaiser methods can increase the credibility of the test data. When the stress–strain difference curve displays the inflection point and the stress–acoustic emission intensity curve has significantly increased point, the stress corresponding to the axial compression is the stress that the rock suffered. This stress avoids displaying several Kaiser points in previous Kaiser effect experiments. 
Based on in-situ stress and actual tectonic evolution, a 3D multi-layer complex geological model was established. This model solves the problem wherein the previous model was oversimplified and could not truly reflect the actual geological structure during the simulation process. A numerical method of in-situ stress field for the entire regional composite salt-gypsum formation was developed based on the finite difference method and nonlinear prediction theory. This method solves the problem wherein laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations have difficulty in obtaining the in-situ stress of ultra-deep composite salt-gypsum formation. 
According to the study results in this thesis, in-situ stress and casing integrity are evaluated in ultra-deep, high temperature, and high pressure composite salt-gypsum formation in Kuqa piedmont, Tarim Oilfield. Combined with actual situation, the rationality of in-situ stress predicting methods is verified in ultra-deep composite salt-gypsum formation.|","Salt-gypsum Formation, In-situ Stress, multi-layer, DRA-Kaiser, Ultra-deep"

Hydraulic fracturing in shale gas reservoirs has often resulted in complex fracture network growth, as evidenced by microseismic monitoring. The nature and degree of fracture complexity must be clearly understood to optimize stimulation design and completion strategy. Unfortunately, the existing single planar fracture models used in the industry today are not able to simulate complex fracture networks. 
A recently developed unconventional complex fracture propagation model is able to simulate complex fracture network propagation in a formation with pre-existing natural fractures. Multiple fracture branches can propagate simultaneously and intersect/cross each other. This paper presents an integrated operator, non-operator and service provider's approach to optimize future hydraulic fracture design by fully integrating all the data captured in the Canadian Horn River shale. 
Based upon insight from the study, which was initiated by the non-operator, continued by the operator and supported by the service provider in two different countries, the operator and non-operator needed to make more informed design decisions and understand the interaction between the shale, the hydraulic and pre-existing natural fracture network and reduce costs. 
Data were captured from reference vertical wells and a multi-well pad. The data incorporated into the study included geophysical, geological, petrophysical, geomechanical and engineering such as dfit (small volume of water pumped into target formation) derived fracture closure pressure, production and pressure data from the horizontal wells in the pad. A generation of 2D natural fracture network is also included in the paper by defining natural fracture parameters such as length, orientation, spacing, friction coefficient, cohesion, and toughness which are almost entirely validated using lab data and geomechanical interpretation. 
The complex hydraulic fracture simulation results calibrated with microseismic and fracturing treatment data were incorporated into a shale gas, numerical simulator and further calibrated with current production history of the candidate multi-wells. The results of the hydraulic fracture, natural fracture and reservoir models were utilized to understand the fracture propagation mechanism in the Canadian Horn River shale gas formation. 
As a result of the project, the team is now able to run different hydraulic fracture design scenarios and assess the impact that each key design parameter has over the candidate well's long term production using a numerical simulator with a unique gridding process. Based on these findings, the operator and non-operator now have an insightful tool that could be used as the building block for future optimization of the fracture design|","completions, pumpimg treatment, multi-staged pad, hydraulic fracture, unconventional gas"

Unconventional reservoirs (UNC) are considered those that do not produce at economic flow rates and cannot be cost-effectively produced without applying stimulation, fracturing, and recovery. They are located in predominantly extensive regional accumulations, which, in most cases, is independent of the stratigraphic and structural traps. This requires using special technology for extraction, either by its oil properties or the characteristics of the rock that contains it. 
Today, these reservoirs represent an interesting source of income, because many of them are found in deposits that were considered to be exhausted or non-economic by traditional recovery methods, and it is estimated that they are present in large volumes. The recently exploited shale plays are typically constituted by a matrix of very fine grain rock (size clay, shale or marl might be), with varying proportions of clay, silica, and carbonate, which act as source rock, and reservoir seals at the same time. They have very low permeability and often require massive stimulation to produce hydrocarbon. 
Generally, resource shale reservoirs must meet a series of requirements to make them economically viable. These conditions are:  
Organic richness (> 2% COT for shale gas and shale oil variable) 
Thermal maturity (> 0.7% Ro) 
Thickness (> 30 m) and areal extent 
Adsorption capacity (mainly in shale gas) 
Fracturability (clay content < 40%)

J., University of Houston| Rabinejadganji, N., University of Houston","|Abstract 
Liquid-rich shale (LRS) volatile oil plays exhibit several challenges to modeling and analyzing such as flattened produced gas oil ratio (GOR), complex phase behavior, rock properties and fluid flow influenced by pore proximity effects in nano pores. In this study we investigated multi-phase flow and the governing flow mechanisms in these resources using a new procedure to divide shale matrix into different sub-media and a new methodology to model well performance. 
We have developed new correlations for modifying PVT properties in nano pores to incorporate the impact of nano-pore confinement on phase behavior. We have subdivided shale matrix into three zones, nano-pores, micro pores, and natural (macro) fractures along with propped fractures with distinctive PVT, rock compaction and relative permeability properties in a compositional simulation model. We have implemented logarithmically-spaced local grid refinement (LS-LGR) to track saturation and pressure changes around the hydraulic fracture. Results from our new method were validated against production data from several LRS oil wells in the Eagle Ford shale. 
Our numerical model reproduced anomalous produced GOR's that have been observed in liquid-rich shale oil wells. The study showed that the main impacts of nano-pore confinement on phase behavior, rock properties and fluid flow are reduction of bubble point, enhancement of critical gas saturation and severe permeability reduction due to compaction. Delayed development of two-phase flow as a result of reduction of the bubble point pressure in nano-pores causes the ""flat"" GOR's observed in early stages of production. Enhancement of critical gas saturation delays mobilization of gas molecules in nano-pores and could extend non-intuitive GOR behavior further when reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point. We found that ultimate oil recovery could change more than 20% by permeability reduction due to compaction. The study revealed that the period of constant produced GOR depends on the volatility of the reservoir fluid and pore size distribution in the reservoir. For moderate-GOR oil reservoirs, the constant GOR duration is greater than for highly volatile oil reservoirs, as well as in reservoirs with a greater percentage of nano pores. 
The methodology introduced in this study allows us to better model LRS volatile oil wells and to estimate EUR more accurately. These new correlations for modifying bulk PVT properties under confinement combined with numerical models enables reservoir engineers to understand better the complicated physics in LRS volatile oil reservoir performance.|","Numerical Model, production mechanisms, LRS production mechanism, Gas Oil Ratio, Liquid-Rich Shale Oil"

Accurate and repeatable assessments of in situ stress magnitudes and orientation in unconventional reservoirs can be complicated by the heterogeneous, inelastic, and/or anisotropic mechanical properties of these rocks and their complex history of burial and diagenesis. The associated vertical and lateral variation in pore pressure and stress through the target zones and bounding intervals can further complicate this effort. For these reasons, some additional factors need to be considered beyond the typical workflow of determining closure stress from standard mini-frac data and using this data to calibrate log derived stress profiles. We present some case study examples from hydrocarbon-producing shales where a more rigorous analysis of the mechanical properties of the shale has allowed a more accurate and repeatable assessment of in situ stress and potential for lamination shearing. Horizontal fracture growth through shear activation of bedding-parallel fabric can be a preferred fracture propagation mechanism in these shales and this behavior can be diagnosed by this improved workflow. In one case study example, in the tight gas Montney siltstone of Western Canada, shear strength anisotropy is shown to be very significant, with bedding parallel shear cohesion less than 10% of the bulk rock cohesion. For such situations it can be shown that shear fracturing of laminations is likely. It has been demonstrated through pressure transient analysis of minifrac injection and flowback data that this can be diagnosed. Many fracturing related mechanisms are also stress dependent and their understanding requires assessment of all in situ stress magnitudes, not just minimum horizontal stress. An improved method of analyzing these stress magnitudes and fracturing mechanisms is described through anisotropy measurements in core samples and a micro-mechanical understanding of the rock fabric. In this way, a petrophysical relationship can be established between anisotropy parameters and rock properties.|","shear fracture, geomechanics, anisotropy, horizontal fracture"

Until 2015, North America’s unconventional resource market was known to be home to the largest oil shale deposits of economic value. Although the recent commodity price fluctuations have exposed the role of geo-politics, world economies and commodity trading on the life cycle of assets, few field development studies have consider the impact of commodity cycles on the development of in-fill wells. Papers have been presented to demonstrate the impact of vertical fracture connectivity and fracture asymmetry on in-fill well performance (due to delayed in-fill drilling), but little has been done on validation and coupling the impact of depletion, due to production, and hydraulic fracturing (due to in-fill efficiency fracture operations). This paper presents results from the analysis of in-fill drilling on well performance. Production data, fracture treatment data, completion and production timing are analyzed using pressure/production history matching techniques and compared with results predicted by data driven models (developed to match well performance) with the aim of proposing in-fill development strategies. Analysis of the field production data indicates that timing of in-fill wells (following the parent well) can influence the in-fill production depending on the level of depletion (cumulative fluid produced) and the size/type of fracture treatments pumped. Analysis of raw production data, modeling results from multi-domain model based coupled simulations and high resolution monitoring data also indicates that the order of the in-fill operations (East-West, Zipper, etc.) also has a significant impact on performance.

Unlike seismic processes, which have undergone research and changes to adapt to the more complex characterization needs of today's wells, acoustic logging techniques have stayed relatively stagnant. In order to stay relevant, acoustic logging processes must adapt for use in unconventionals as well. The following discussion focuses on four seismic techniques adapted for acoustic logging processes, the process for choosing these particular techniques to adapt, and the results achieved. |We have based new acoustic logging algorithms and routines on these four seismic techniques and adapted the research into proprietary software for processing raw, acoustic waveform data. First, we have adapted the use of compressional waves to map drops in energy across natural fractures which allows industry to move away from many of the limitations imposed by more widely used techniques. Second, as part of the workflow presented in the compressional fracture identification methodology, we have adapted stacking to improve results and amplify anomalies. Third, in order to provide a broad available toolsets and usable data, we have incorporated advanced filtering routines based on predictive deconvolution, which can be used to process acoustic data from alternative tools or to enhance data collected using measurement-while-drilling or logging-while-drilling tools. Fourth and last, applicable to both shear and compressional waveform processing, we have chosen to move away from Alford-based azimuth computations, or at least correct for assumptions in Alford-based azimuth computations that are not relevant in unconventionals, so that borehole deviation does not adversely affect the processing. |The use of compressional waves to map natural fracture patterns has found great success in both vertical and lateral wells and has been used in the field in the Permian, Eagle Ford, the Bakken, and in various international fields.

Sevensprings oilfield is one of the oldest mature-flood fields with target stratum between 1000 and 1200m TVD in China with Strong permeability heterogeneity within the range of 0.01-50mD. Most of its wells have been fractured. But for now, the fractured wells have lost their power to maintain productivity. Early analyses show the wells have gained different production dynamics and the stress field around bottom hole was unclear after nearly 20 years water-flooding. Without a proper refracturing strategy, it still could not awake the wells properly. 
This paper presents a novel method to determine the refracturing strategy and the priorities of the candidate wells by comprehensive analysis, which considers reservoir properties, remaining oil distributions and induced stress fields. Application shows this method is effective and it can provide a reference for the analogous reservoirs to develop refracturing strategy. First we found out the basic situation of remaining oil and reasons for low-yielding of different wells under various fracture orientation and stratigraphic features through simulation. Combined with these two factors, we can divide the wells into different types which represented by residual oil distribution and location characteristics. After this, we obtained the induced stress field through marching the Waterflooding history. Through analyzing the hydraulic fracture steering angle and steering range, we can figure out the feasibility of steering fracturing to each well type. At last, we made a productivity simulation for each well type with corresponding feature models and fracture steering possibility. Based on this, we can develop the suitable refracturing strategy for every well type and gain the priorities according to the simulated productivity increment. 
The novel method established in this paper has been effectively applied in Sevensprings oilfield. Before this, there were more than ten well had been refractured, the average productivity growth rate was 34%, and some wells came to capacity drop because of incorrect treatment. Based on this method, we chose several candidates from more than 100 wells prepared to be refractured. And three of them have already been processed. All of them achieved preferable stimulation response. 3-3 shows an increasing fold of 3.85 from 2.57 t /d to 7.64 t /d. Shen-27 shows a daily production increase of nearly three times from 2.57 t /d to 7.64 t /d. Nowadays, larger-scale application was ongoing 
Application shows this new method to determine refracturing strategy and well stimulation priority is effectively.

The effects of the earth's tectonic movements are well understood, especially in the formulation of stress anisotropy in a large region. This primarily mechanical effect stays unchanged because the support systems, such as faults, compressions, etc., remain unchanged until the next major tectonic activity. On the other hand, pressure effects are generally semi-permanent and are usually affected by the production history of the formation. In this stress domain, fracture placement during a stimulation treatment will always follow the direction of maximum stress; by definition, this is a fixed direction defined by the known stress anisotropy landscape. 
This paper presents a different approach for the stimulation process. Instead of a conventional, static, or end-point vision of the stimulation, a dynamic, or temporary, time-dependent stimulation method is introduced. The new method creates a small tectonic motion—significantly smaller than that of natural tectonics—and uses it to temporarily modify the local stress anisotropy. The ""micro"" tectonic motion is created by means of a conventional fracture placed in the natural maximum stress direction. Another fracture can then be created using the same approach but in a temporarily modified stress field that forces it in a different fracture direction. This new multioriented hydraulic fracture (MOHF) stimulation method can enhance state-of-the-art hydraulic fracturing technology by requiring an understanding of the transient geomechanic response in the treatment area. 
As a time-dependent method, this approach can create new opportunities in both conventional and unconventional plays by providing connectivity to previously unattainable locations in the formation. Unfortunately, it can also result in new complications. Industry standard fracture simulation technology becomes incomplete, as most models neglect the transient response of the system. Additionally, the availability of data related to the dynamic behavior of rocks is limited. The dynamic compression of the rock, slip characteristics between rock layers, and the amount of energy stored within slip planes—all recorded as a function of time—are particularly important when considering an MOHF process. Additional testing should be performed to obtain these data. With such data, time-sensitive operational recommendations for performing the MOHF stimulation can be provided to help achieve the maximum production increase from the well. 
This paper also discusses a computational validation of the MOHF process. As traditional hydraulic fracture simulations are derived using static formation properties and steady-state assumptions of the formation behavior, a unique transient three-dimensional (3D) computational geomechanic fracture simulator was developed to perform this study. The new model incorporates cohesive zone elements to represent the fracture plane and captures the dynamics of fracture initiation and propagation, as well as the transient stress modification in the formation. A realistic 3D fracture transient behavior is accounted for by the inclusion of multiple rock layers in the model, which are connected through energy absorbing frictional elements.

Development blocks around Daqing, P.R. China are challenging directional drilling applications. Xushen comprises the largest volcanic gas reservoir in the Ying Cheng formation among 5 development blocks. The formations are hard and abrasive and include a volcanic basement of rhyolite, tuff and breccia with unconfined compressive strength (UCS) up to 30 kpsi. 
Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bits experience high vibrations and premature wear and bit ring-outs. Overall, PDC performance results in short footage and very low rates of penetration (ROP). For a decade, heavy-set roller cones, IADC 617 to 637, were believed to be the correct alternative to drill this hard, heterogeneous formation. However, roller-cone bits are slower than PDC bits and have a limited bearing life. A detailed engineering analysis was undertaken to increase both the penetration rate and distance drilled. 
As a result of this study, a hybrid bit which combines the advantages of a fixed-cutter and roller-cone was employed to drill in this application. The PDC portion of the hybrid bit design also included a new cutter edge geometry to reduce spalling and impact damage observed on historical PDC runs. The first run in the Ying Cheng group increased ROP by a record 115%, with nearly two times the distance drilled compared to roller-cone bits in the same section. This revolutionary new bit and cutter technology improved reliability and increased drilling efficiency for the duration of the project.

With the advancement of drilling and fracturing technology in recent years, multi-stage fractured horizontal wells have become a norm in the development of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs in North America. This has created a renewed interest in major formations of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Due to higher completion cost, it is crucial to find an optimal fracture size and spacing as well as wellbore spacing for these horizontal wells. Acid Fracturing is a stimulation process in which acid is used to enhance the conductivity of a hydraulic fracture through differential etching of the fracture face. The effectiveness of acid fracturing depends on retaining fracture conductivity under closure stress after treatment. Fracture face roughness created by the acid etching and mechanical properties of rock after acid treatment are two important factors that play a vital role in retaining conductivity after fracture closure. Acid fracturing treatments of carbonate reservoirs have yielded an increase in production in many areas of the world. The Swan Hills Formation (a member of Beaverhill Lake group) in Alberta, Canada, a carbonate oil play, is the focus of this paper. 
A dual porosity model was employed to integrate core, rock mechanics, PVT, stimulation, and production data. Acid treatment data was used to estimate the fracture geometry and conductivity which was then incorporated into a three dimensional reservoir simulation model. A multi-layer, single-wellbore reservoir model of horizontal heterogeneities across the study area was built based on core calibrated formation and geomechanical log data. The model input parameters were further fine-tuned using production history matching. 
The calibrated reservoir parameters, based on a history matched model, were used for initial fluid in-place estimation, production forecasting and to investigate the fracture and wellbore interference. Interference analysis was performed based on reservoir pressure depletion and decline in cumulative production. A sensitivity study of fracture density, wellbore spacing, and lateral length of wellbore was carried out and their effects on oil and gas production are discussed. Recommendations on optimal fracture and wellbore spacing for the Swan Hills Formation are also provided.|","Wellbore Spacing, Reservoir Modeling, Beaverhill Lake, Carbonate, Acid Fracturing"

The Ordos basin, located in northwest China, has large known hydrocarbon reserves that represent unique reservoir challenges and require specific operational, logistical, and technical expertise. One of the immediate objectives for PetroChina Changqing is to exploit these low-permeability oil and gas sandstones of the Yanchang formation, and this is done through both vertical and horizontal wells types that include single-stage and multistage hydraulic fracturing treatments. 
Historically, individual well productivity has been impacted by complex reservoir dynamics, uncertain subsurface properties, and identifying those areas where critical geological and reservoir factors exist in order to generate substantial production. However, most hydraulic fracturing treatments result in low production rates due to reservoir pressure being below the hydrostatic pressure gradient. Therefore, principal fracturing challenges include trying to engineer a highly conductive flow path that depends on fluid viscosity and stability to build geometry and transport proppant toward the fracture tip, while rapidly returning to the base-fluid viscosity to be flowed back. 
Since reduced fracture conductivity and length were detrimental to well performance, a hydraulic fracturing technique that incorporates the creation of channels within the fracture was deployed. This technology optimized reservoir inflow performance through a specified engineering workflow that requires specific equipment and pumping controls with fluid and fiber technologies. These channels created infinite-conductivity paths for fluid to flow from the reservoir to the wellbore, resulting in higher well productivity. 
The deployment and application of this technology included 65 treatments performed on five vertical and five horizontal wells in oil blocks and two vertical wells in a gas block. Production performance for all oil wells treated with the flow-channel fracturing technique had initial production index figures being 2.4 times the field average and those wells continue to be upper performers when compared to 180-day accumulated production figures. For the gas wells, 4 to 5 times initial gas production rate was achieved when compared to the average offset wells. In all well cases, channel fracturing increased operational efficiency while resulting in no screenouts.|","channel fracturing, Ordos basin, China, tight reservoir"

A novel integrated workflow based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Factor Analysis (FA) is developed to evaluate organic shale reservoirs. Current organic shale formation evaluation techniques cannot distinguish immobile hydrocarbons from producible hydrocarbons. The new workflow aims to quantify producible hydrocarbons and characterize shale reservoir quality. 
The new approach incorporates NMR factor analysis technique with NMR and spectroscopy data to focus on the characterization of organic shale by: 1) identifying fluid types with associated pore size distribution; 2) computing pore fluid volumes to quantify producible hydrocarbon in place; and 3) fluid facies classification to evaluate reservoir quality and identify the sweet spot. 
Understanding fluid types and volumetrics in shale reservoirs is the key to evaluate reservoir quality and estimate hydrocarbon production. The integrated workflow separates fluid hydrocarbon from kerogen with NMR and advanced spectroscopy data. In addition, it differentiates the formation fluid into individual pore fluids, including bound hydrocarbon, clay-bound water, irreducible water (capillary-bound), irreducible oil (capillary-bound), free water and producible hydrocarbon. The workflow also provides the porosity of each pore fluid and quantifies producible hydrocarbon, which is one of the most important influencing factors of shale reservoir production. The reservoir quality of fluid facies from NMR factor analysis is characterized using pore fluid porosities. Zones with high producible hydrocarbon porosity and no free water is classified to have the best reservoir quality for production. 
The results from the novel workflow successfully characterize the reservoir quality and producibility, and mark the sweet spot of organic shale reservoirs.|","Organic Shale Reservoir, Producible Hydrocarbon, Factor Analysis, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Reservoir Quality"

D., University of Calgary and TAQA North Ltd.| Clarkson, C. R., University of Calgary","|Abstract 
After hydraulic fracture treatment, wells typically produce significant volumes of water, which is primarily recovered fracturing fluid. The amount of fracturing fluid produced back is called load recovery. Single phase water production may continue for several days before oil breakthrough from the formation occurs. A wide range of load recoveries (15%–80%) are reported in the literature, depending on various reservoir, fracture, pumping and operational parameters. This study conducts a comprehensive numerical and statistical analysis to identify the most important parameters affecting load recovery. The sensitivity of oil breakthrough time to these parameters is also investigated. 
A fit-for-purpose model was created using a commercial coupled reservoir flow/geomechanics simulator to simulate fracturing treatment and flowback operations. Water and oil production trends, and flow regimes observed in the model, are verified using rate-transient analysis (RTA). The effect of twenty parameters including pumping rate, shut-in time, producing bottomhole pressure, production rate constraint, matrix porosity and permeability, matrix and hydraulic fracture compressibility, relative permeability end points and capillary pressure on load recovery and oil breakthrough time is investigated by utilizing Design of Experiment (DOE). The developed model considers non-uniform leak-off during pumping, providing a better understating of water retention, while the application of the DOE method allows the effect of various parameters and their interaction to be studied rigorously. 
A critical finding is that the majority of total load recovery occurs within the first three months of production. Furthermore, matrix permeability, shut-in time, connate water saturation and fracture compressibility, were found to be the most dominant factors, which can impact the load recovery by up to 22%, 15%, 14%, and 13%, respectively. Matrix permeability, production rate constraint, fracture residual oil saturation and shut-in time are four of the prominent parameters affecting oil breakthrough time. 
Understanding the impact of operational parameters such as shut-in time and production rate can help industry to implement recycling/disposal options and ultimately optimize load recovery. This can also create significant environmental compliance benefits for operators in addition to benefitting operational efficiency.|","Shale/Tight Oil, Oil  Breakthrough, Design of Experiment, Hydraulic Fracturing Load Recovery, Flowback  Analysis"

Drilling horizontal wells in soft formations can pose significant risks that require careful planning and execution. During 2014, Virginia Indonesia Co. Limited (Vico) successfully completed two surface-to-inseam horizontal wells to appraise coalbed methane (CBM) production potential on their Sanga Sanga license in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Both wells passed through soft shales and coals that exhibited breakouts in offset wells, in addition to heavily depleted zones exhibiting large fluid losses in an area well known for shallow gas blowouts. Geomechanical analysis of information from nearby offset wells was used to determine the mud-weight window and fluid properties required to effectively manage these conditions. The results were incorporated into the preliminary well design and planning, and with model matching carried out in real time while drilling operations were underway, any deviations in wellbore integrity were managed as they arose. 
The drilling success was, in large part, a result of extensive preplanning and a regimented approach to how the wells would be drilled and any instability dealt with promptly. In addition, real-time monitoring that identified deviations from model-based predictions provided invaluable information for planning subsequent wells. The methodical approach to planning and execution of these wells led to their successful completion, with the results potentially reshaping the Indonesian CBM and energy industry.|","Wellbore Stability, CBM, Indonesia, Geomechanics, Drilling"

For CNOOC ZhanJiang branch (CCLZ), 2014 was a milestone year where for the first time, they managed their deepwater exploration in Lingshui 17-2 (LS17-2) block independently, without the involvement of other international oil companies. CCLZ faced many drilling challenges in their six-well deepwater project, including stuck pipe, kick and mud losses due to wellbore instability, as experienced on previous five exploration wells drilled in nearby area. The occurence of these events has the potential to increase operational cost and risk. 
The sedimentary geology in Lingshui block is complex, and the downhole environment is challenging as the pore pressure ramps up quickly above the reservoir resulting in a very narrow mud weight window. To address these challenges and drill the wells safely, the exploration project management team decided to employ real-time geomechanics monitoring. A mechanical earth model (MEM) was constructed before drilling to define optimized wellbore stability boundaries and identify potential hazards associated with the planned trajectory. Based on the real-time logging while drilling (LWD) data, the MEM was updated and drilling parameters adjusted to keep within operational limits. 
Using LWD data, the pore pressure was calculated in real-time and verified against other drilling observations, such as connection gas, flow tests, drilling parameter analysis and caving analysis. The fracture gradient was calibrated against a formation integration test (FIT) at the casing shoe. These real-time updated fracture gradient and pore pressures were then applied to keep mud weight and equivalent circulating density (ECD) within the narrow safe mud weight window. Upon completion of the well, real-time pore pressures predictions were compared with actual pressure measurements in permeable sandstone intervals, and the results found to match very well. This provided the drilling team with confidence in both the real-time data quality, and the accuracy of the pore pressure prediction. The application of the measurements while drilling and the resulting reduction in uncertainty meant that the 16"" casing was not required in the next four deepwater wells, saving USD8 million per well and significantly impacting the economic efficiency of this project.|","real-time geomechanics, Deepwater, LWD sonic"

Unconventional shale gas reservoirs around the world have been proven to store gigantic volumes of natural gas. It has been demonstrated with both laboratory and mathematical work that these reservoirs can be represented by a quintuple porosity formulation plus an additional storage mechanism provided by dissolved gas in kerogen. All these storage mechanisms must be considered for estimation of original gas in place (OGIP). Otherwise pessimistic values of OGIP and recoveries will be obtained by ignoring any of these mechanisms. This paper presents a new easy-to-use Material Balance Equation (MBE) for shale gas reservoirs that considers the contribution of free, adsorbed and dissolved gas and their effects on cumulative gas production. Furthermore the proposed MBE takes into account the stress-dependency of permeability and porosity as the reservoir is depleted. 
Aguilera (2008) formulated a MBE to account for the effect of fracture compressibility on OGIP determination in stress-sensitive naturally fractured reservoirs. Cabrapan et al. (2014) extended the method by incorporating adsorption in shale gas reservoirs. The authors used the Langmuir Adsorption theory for quantifying the adsorbed gas volume as a function of average reservoir pressure. In this paper, the method is further extended to include the effect of production by diffusion of dissolved gas from kerogen. The volume of dissolved gas depends on the total fractional volume of kerogen in shale and the methane concentration in the kerogen body, which is in turn a function of pressure and temperature, as proposed by Swami et al. (2013). 
Results are presented as crossplots of P/Z (pressure/gas deviation factor) vs. Gp (cumulative gas production), Gp vs. time and gas rate vs. time. The plots allow detecting four stages of production in a shale gas reservoir: 1) production of free gas from fractures and organic porosity, 2) production of free gas from the inorganic matrix when fractures start closing, 3) production by desorption from the organic material and 4) production by diffusion of dissolved gas. The same trends have been observed in Devonian Shales of the Appalachian Basin where long production histories are available. It is concluded that dissolved gas is not only an additional storage mechanism but it also provides an important pressure and production contribution in shale reservoirs. 
The new consideration introduced in the MBE proposed in this paper is of importance because although diffusion from kerogen in shale gas reservoirs is by nature a slow process, it provides long term production rates with relatively small declines. To the best of our knowledge, an analytical MBE that includes simultaneously stress-dependent porosity and permeability, free gas, adsorbed gas and dissolved gas has not been published previously in the literature.|","Shale Gas Reservoirs, Material Balance Equation, Diffusion, Original Gas in Place, Dissolved Gas"

E., University of Kansas| Gomes, Joao Henrique Bessa, University of Kansas| Ghahfarokhi, R. Barati, University of Kansas","|Abstract 
Devonian-Mississippian Chattanooga shale plays in North America are categorized as unconventional reserves with potential hydrocarbon resource accumulations. Unlike Chattanooga shale in the Appalachian region, less effort has been dedicated to its correspondent in the Ozark region. The ultra-tight nature of the formation causes fast decline of the production and small recovery factors. Application of EOR techniques such as CO2 flooding, among other techniques, can potentially improve the recovery of Chattanooga reservoirs. Characterization of these reservoirs is therefore an essential step to fully understand the associated complexities of the reservoir as well as to evaluate the economic viability of their exploitation. This paper therefore presents a fully integrated characterization at multiple scales including petrophysical, geophysical and geological evaluation, geomechanical and geochemical analysis of the black shale sequence in Sumner County, Kansas. Multi-scale dataset for this regional characterization is obtained from laboratory measured petrophysical parameters, well-log measurements as well as post-stack depth (PoSDM) seismic data. 
Chattanooga shale in Sumner County has an average TOC of ~2.26 wt. % in the middle shale member with additional organic porosity of 5% and a vitrinite reflectance (Ro %) of 0.62. It is classified as a shale oil resource with OOIP of 4 MMbbl. Petrophysical correlations developed at wellbore vicinity were trained with artificial neural networks (ANNs) and correlated with seismic to provide lateral distribution of such properties farther from the wellbore. Moreover, due to the heavy reliance of unconventional shale plays on fracture network for improved flow conditions, fracture models were developed based on the mineral-brittleness as well as the fracture toughness. Consequently, a complete study based on compositional numerical simulation was conducted to analyze the potential of CO2 as an EOR technique, together with an evaluation of the impact of reservoir and fracture parameters in the well productivity potential. Subsequently, an economic optimization process was also formulated to obtain the best gas injection design for the highest Net Present Value (NPV). The cumulative oil was notably observed to increase by the use of the optimum injection design. Moreover, the huff-n-puff injection of CO2 proved to be a viable option by increasing the final oil recovery from 10% to 53% using optimal parameters.|","Reservoir Characterization, EOR for Shale, Chattanooga Shale Formation, Sweetspot Mapping, CO2 Huff-n-Puff"

In Kuwait’s largest reservoir, the Burgan Field, exploration wells have large potential for drilling optimization and savings; specifically a 22 inch hole, that is drilled conventionally using multiple roller cone bits in multiple trips through challenging inter-bedded formations. Hybrid drill bit technology, roller cone combined with Polycrystalline Diamond Compact, was introduced in search for an economically viable solution to deliver wells faster and achieve yearly operator targets. This paper analyzes the breakthrough drilling performance achieved by a 22 inch hybrid bit in comparison to conventional roller cones offsets and provides conclusions on economic viability. 
The main challenges drilling the 22 inch section are drill bit durability and drilling vibrations through 2,000 ft. of inter-bedded limestone, shale and sandstone. In addition to curing fluid losses in certain porous formation layers that negatively affect Rate Of Penetration (ROP). Typically two roller cone bits are used on rotary drive to drill this section at 15 feet per hour, consuming seven drilling days. Using Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bit with a performance motor to increase ROP performance is not an economically viable solution. Using hybrid drill bit on rotary drive combines the benefits of PDC blades’ durability and higher cutting efficiency with the cones’ stability by grinding and gouging into the formation. 
The deployment of the hybrid technology was a collaboration project between a national oil company and a major oil services company. The teams focused on optimizing the complete drilling system including the bottom hole assembly, hydraulics, drilling parameters and geological factors to match the hybrid drill bit mechanism. 
The hybrid design selection and drilling optimization resulted in a 142-percent ROP improvement from offsets average performance. The hybrid design drilled the 22 inch hole after casing shoe to section total depth at 31 feet per hour, using one bit, in three drilling days in comparison to seven days average performance. The total operator savings from this section was approximately USD 175,000 in the first deployment. Such remarkable economical savings and technical optimization proved that the hybrid technology is the viable solution for Burgan 22 inch application.|","Hybrid Technology, Drilling Optimization, Breakthrough Performance, Savings Rig Days, Engineering Application Study Design Modification"

A tetrahedron-grid based parallel geomechanics simulator is developed and presented in this paper. Parallel computing is employed to handle large scale problems by benefiting from its features of distributed memory storage and efficient runtime reduction. This simulator aims to describe rock matrix deformation and its interactions with pore fluid. In the consideration of the feasibility in coupling with a variety of existing reservoir simulators, the modularized geomechanics simulator is designed to be a library. Through interfaces provided by the library, conventional reservoir simulators can get geomechanics effects involved. 
In this paper, the framework of a parallel geomechanics simulator and the strategy for coupling with a reservoir simulator are presented. Iteratively coupling approach is employed to make geomechanics modeling more independent and flexible. The procedure for solving solid mechanism and calculating coupling parameters is general, which can be applied to more complicated constitutive laws and rock property descriptions. A parallel strategy is proposed to improve the computational efficiency of solving the coupled problem. To verify the utility and efficiency of the geomechanics simulator, simulations coupled with a three-phase black oil model are performed.

In the prolific Burgan field, South East Kuwait, new well profiles are being employed which require the 16 inch hole section to be drilled deeper. This new well profile requires drilling through interbedded abrasive sandstones and sticky shale which were previously drilled in 12 <U+00BC> inch hole size. Drilling becomes increasingly challenging using larger diameter bits where torque fluctuations, down-hole conditions and durability limit performance. As the casing profiles changed, each section's drilling solution was revisited as drilling dynamics and performance diminished drastically when drilled in the larger hole size. What was once a viable solution to drill the section in 12 <U+00BC> inch becomes no longer suitable when drilled in 16 inch. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the engineering analysis for large diameter hole application and the selection of an optimized hybrid drill bit design, roller cone combined with Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC), to maximize drilling performance where standard PDC or roller cone bits alone fail to provide an optimal solution. 
The 12 <U+00BC> inch section was typically drilled using a rotary bottom hole assembly with a roller cone bit or using a performance mud motor with a PDC bit. Drilling parameters were reduced in the upper layers especially with PDC bits as they involve sticky shale which can induce bit balling. While in the lower layers the abrasive formations tend to wear down roller cone bits. 
Combining the benefits of both bit types, a 16 inch hybrid bit was proposed to answer the challenge of drilling the section as fast as a PDC bit while providing the stability, torque control and smooth hole condition generated by a roller cone. Selecting an appropriate hybrid design to match the application resulted in an initial trial of a durable hybrid bit that finished the interval with virtually no wear on the bit and significantly improved borehole quality. The second trial of the hybrid bit with a modified, more aggressive design approximately doubled the ROP of a PDC bit while maintaining a smooth hole profile and minimizing torque. 
PDC bits generally provide faster rate of penetration than roller cone bits while generating higher torque fluctuations as they drill by shearing bottom hole formation. Due to their high torque demands, PDC bits require an additional mud motor to drive them efficiently in larger hole sizes. Roller cones crush and gouge the bottom hole formation and due to their mechanical rollers result in reduced reactive torque and a smoother hole profile. Hybrid drill bit technology proven the capability of achieving the benefits of both designs in specific selected applications.|","Hybrid Technnology Deployment, Highest Performance, Large Diameter Hole, Producing Earlier Saving Rig Days, Design Optimization"

Mutiara is a mature field located in the onshore part of East Kalimantan which has been on production for over 30 years. The field is dominated by gas reservoirs with a much lower presence of oil reservoirs. Production mechanisms range from natural depletion to weak and strong water drive, particularly in some of the shallow areas. High decline rates are very common, which results in a very dynamic and challenging environment. The main artificial lift used in this field is gas lift. However, this method is not efficient for depleted or high water cut wells. Another issue is oil wells which located in remote areas which need high investment for surface facilities including gas lift line network and sufficient pressure to lift the oil up to the surface. Therefore, more and more wells will be idle without implementation of other artificial lift systems techniques. 
Several downhole pumping types have been assessed to tackle these issues such as Electric Submersible Pump (ESP), Progressive Cavity Pump (PCP), and Linear Rod Pump (LRP). Considering hilly swampy conditions of the field that requires more compact type of surface unit and flexible to match displacement rate to well capability as well declines. It is then decided to use LRP to unlock oil potential in idle wells. 
The first installation of LRP was on September 2014 in X-1 well, this well is the first well drilled in 1982. This installation succeeds on bringing back the well on production.

Fractured basement reservoirs represent more than 20% of the world's oil and gas reserves. Because of their heterogeneity and complex, unconventional natures, the process of mapping the reservoir properties presents a monumental task. The identification of the high productivity zones in basement reservoirs presents a major challenge because of the drastic vertical and temporal variation in porosity and permeability. 
Reservoir characterization in terms of rock-forming minerals, multipore system analyses, hydrocarbon typing and quantification, and textural variations can be performed by combining quad-combo, elemental spectroscopy, and resistivity-imaging measurements, regardless of the conveyance technique, in an integrated workflow. 
Because fractures play a major role in hydrocarbon production, rapid reservoir decline, and undesirable fluids breakthrough, fracture description is crucial. Aside from conventional techniques to quantify matrix porosity and permeability, a workflow has been designed to provide additional unconventional techniques for multipore system analyses using high-resolution resistivity imaging. With one technique, the resistivity image is sculptured using an object-oriented filter that produces fracture density, aperture, and porosity. The other technique is based on a transformation of image conductivity to porosity that is classified into a matrix and secondary pores to estimate their contribution to permeability. 
The multipore system analysis is then used to determine the cementation exponent parameter needed for hydrocarbon quantification. Finally, critically stressed fractures are identified, using geomechanical analyses, to determine the production-contributing fractured zones. 
Although the technique/workflow used is relatively new and uncommon for data acquired while drilling, its results successfully met the objectives of the study with quality deliverables.

In a vertically transverse isotropic (VTI) medium, accurate prediction of the vertical and horizontal Young's moduli (E) and Poisson's ratios (?) is crucial to predicting minimum horizontal stress (shmin) and hence selecting drilling mud, cement weights, and perforation locations. Fully characterizing geomechanical properties of VTI shale requires five independent stiffness coefficients: C33, C44, C66, C11, and C13. In a vertical well, C33 and C44 are directly calculated from the velocity of the vertically propagating P- and S- waves, while C66 is estimated from the Stoneley wave velocity. To obtain C11 and C13, an empirical model must be employed. This study integrates laboratory mechanical and sonic measurements to evaluate the ANNIE and modified-ANNIE models and extend the dynamic-to-static conversion equation. 
Laboratory static and dynamic geomechanical methods were applied to multiple core materials extracted at different depths from a target shale play. The dynamic elastic moduli were measured using a laboratory sonic scanner; velocities were measured in different directions to obtain C33, C44, C11, C66, and C13. The dynamic data were then applied in the ANNIE and modified-ANNIE models for estimating the dynamic elastic moduli, including dynamic Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. The static elastic moduli were measured using axial compression experiments; horizontal and vertical core plugs were tested to account for anisotropy. 
Static and dynamic results illustrated horizontal Young's moduli were predominantly higher than vertical Young's moduli, which suggested a horizontal layered structure. Vertical Poisson's ratios can be greater or smaller than horizontal Poisson's ratios, which is consistent with the prediction of the modified-ANNIE model. Conversely, the ANNIE model always predicts ?(vert) = ?(horz). Static and dynamic data illustrated the anisotropic shmin was predominantly higher than the isotropic shmin. This implied that using an isotropic model to predict laminated shale will underestimate shmin. It was noticed that the static Young's modulus increased with decreasing porosity for the target interval. The elastic moduli measured from the dynamic method were consistently higher than those measured from the static method. The dynamic and static data were used to fit the widely-used dynamic-to-static conversion equations—the Canady and Morales equations. The Canady equation was extended to the ""very hard"" (greater than 70 GPa Young's modulus) regime, while the Morales equation was extended to the regime of porosity < 10%. Finally, shmin predicted by different models was compared with the measurements, showing that modified-ANNIE improved the prediction by solving the stress underestimation issue of the ANNIE and isotropic models.|","Elastic Moduli and Stress, Unconventional Reservoirs, vertically transverse anisotropic, Laboratory Geomechanics, modified ANNIE model"

Exhaust plumes from generators, pumps, and compressors aboard offshore platforms pose a hazard to crew and equipment. Mitigation for exhaust plume impingement has traditionally been achieved by locating the exhaust uptake away from sensitive areas of the platform, either by use of long horizontal duct runs, a very tall exhaust stack (> 20m), or some combination of the two. These solutions result in an exhaust system that is complicated to design and that adds a lot of weight to the platform. A more practical and weight efficient alternative exists: plume cooling. 
Plume cooling technology has been in use for more than 40 years on military ships for the purpose of infrared signature suppression, and for the protection of sensitive weapons and communications systems that would otherwise be damaged by hot impinging exhaust gases. The operating principles of a plume cooler for application to the offshore oil industry are the same as for a military ship. The use of a plume cooler allows for a more compact and lightweight exhaust, but surprisingly this technology has only started being applied on offshore platforms in the past couple of years. 
The authors of this paper have more than 28 years of combined experience in the design and manufacture of plume coolers for diesel and gas turbine engines. In this paper the authors present a typical plume impingement problem aboard an offshore platform: an LM2500 gas turbine generator (GTG) that is located centrally in close proximity to the helipad, derrick and deck crane. Using the tools they have developed for plume dispersion analyses on military ships, the authors present the predicted impingement impact of the baseline exhaust on areas of interest (AOI) on the platform as well as the benefit of applying plume cooling. A comparison is also provided between the plume cooling solution and the traditional solution of raising the exhaust stack height, with weight being a main point of comparison.|","plume, heating, trajectory, exhaust, impinge"

Do fractures help or hinder production in hydraulically stimulated resource plays? Most say they help, but some say they hinder. After monitoring productivity for over 10 years in a number of plays in Shell's unconventional portfolio, it appears that the evidence for fractures helping is more conceptual than empirical, further substantiated by a detailed literature review. The objective of this paper therefore is to bring some objectivity to the discussion around the impact of structure using logical arguments by reason, incorporating knowledge of the variability in structure and well performance within the spectrum of unconventional plays. 
Fundamental to this assessment is the recognition that different scales of features will have a markedly different impact. And to communicate the concepts herein, small-scale features are referred to as ""natural fractures"" and large-scale features, referred to as ""faults"" or ""lineaments"". 
This analysis indicates that the variability in (small-scale) natural fracture intensity across most plays is not sufficient to be detected in well performance metrics, given the other sub-surface heterogeneity and the large range in estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) for any given set of wells. Furthermore, natural fracture connectivity is typically low and stimulation of networks is not supported by data or trials. It is proposed to consider natural fractures as an intrinsic rock property which will modify the bulk geomechanical properties of the formation. The only exception found was for folded tight-sand plays, where fracture network connectivity may be sufficient to provide a measurable enhanced deliverability. 
Understanding the impact of seismically-visible, planar, structural features (e.g. faults or lineaments) proved to be more problematic, with operators reporting both EUR increases and decreases. This inconsistency is explained with a novel concept classifying faults as contained or uncontained, contingent on whether they are within a closed fluid- and pressure-contained system, or not (respectively) before and after hydraulic stimulation. 
Rather than searching for a production performance correlation, it is suggested that an enhanced understanding of the physical processes during a hydraulic stimulation would be more beneficial to clarify the impact of structure. And to this aim, a compilation of potential fracturing diagnostics is presented herein.|","hydraulic stimulation, faults, natural fracture, contained uncontained, resource plays"

In the process of separate layer injection and production, downhole flow measurement is always a difficult problem and is the bottleneck for realizing flow automatic control. To solve this problem, a new swing-rod flowmeter is disclosed in this paper. 
The structure of the swing-nod flowmeter mainly comprises a sampler, a swing-rod, a displacement transfer rod, a target and a sensor etc. A hollow swing-nod which inserted in the measuring tube is used as the sensitive element. At the end of swing-nod is a sampler which is used as the sampling element of the fluid to be measured, Eddy current displacement sensor is used as sensitive element to measure the displacement of the target. The working principle is: when fluid flowing thought the sampler, a displacement of the swing-nod is produced. The displacement reflects the rate of flow. The displacement of the swing rod is transfer to the electronic cabin by the transfer rod, by measuring the displacement of the target mounted on the transfer rod, the quality of the flowing fluid can be measured accurately. 
Downhole flowmeter is required to be with high working pressure, long service life, strong anti-interference ability and small volume. Especially for the battery-powered metering system, low power consumption is necessary for flowmeter. The Swing-rod flowmeter presents excellent performance, the working pressure can reach 70Mpa, range ratio is 30, the minimum flow measurement is 0.5m3/day, and measurement precision is 3%. The advantages of the swing-rod flowmeter include: high working pressure, low power consumption, compact structure, wide measurement range, convenient range adjustment and strong anti-interference ability. The Swing-rod flowmeter is suit for downhole flow measurement. 
In one hand, the pressure is very high in the downhole environment, in the other hand, small flow measurement require high sensitivity. The existing flow measurement technology is hard to be used in downhole flow measurement directly. Swing-rod flowmeter provides a perfect solution for downhole flow measurement and flow control; it has been successfully used in separate layer water flooding system.|","Downhole flow measurement, Flowmeter, Separate layer injection"

Recently, several authors have explored new methods for quantitatively analyzing multi-phase flowback data from multi-fractured horizontal wells (MFHW) to extract both fracture and reservoir parameters. These techniques provide much of the same information as long-term rate-transient analysis (RTA), although in a much shorter period of time. Flowback analysis is complicated by a rapidly changing fracture network and wellbore environment, multi-phase flow in the fractures (and possibly the reservoir), completion heterogeneity, as well as other effects which are often not present, or are ignored, when analyzing long-term (online) production data. 
For quantitative flowback analysis, the current authors have previously presented data-driven, pseudo-analytical methods for estimating key fracture properties (i.e. conductivity and half-length) from high-frequency, short-duration production test data. Models have been developed for both oil and gas wells representing a variety of reservoir and operating conditions. In this work, the models and procedures are extended to apply to more challenging reservoir/completion scenarios and are used in the analysis of several case studies from Canada. Each of the case studies demonstrate either the potential value add of the developed techniques, or a unique extension to the basic analysis methods. 
The case studies analyzed herein focus on light tight oil plays and consider layered reservoirs, multi-well flowback, and oil fracs in oil reservoirs. Further, the potential capital savings associated with conducting quantitative flowback analysis of early-time production test data is demonstrated. Each case study therefore presents a unique set of challenges that are often encountered in the real world. Numerical simulations are used to validate the sequence of flow-regimes depicted in the models. 
The methods presented in this paper will serve to partially satisfy the demands of industry to develop new methods for characterizing hydraulic fractures and forecasting production, particularly early in the well life. Through the use of several unique case studies, the wide-spread applicability and versatility of the techniques is demonstrated.|","Flowback, History-Matching, Reservoir Characterization, Unconventional Oil and Gas, Rate-Transient Analysis"

The application of a new Material Point Method (MPM) approach to model the proppant distribution in a reservoir where hydraulic fractures interact with natural fractures is presented and validated with an Eagle Ford well. The new MPM approach uses particles to represent the slurry and its effects on the hydraulic and natural fractures. The particles are injected in the hydraulic fractures and their action causes the hydraulic fractures to propagate and interact with the natural fractures thus providing new pathways for the proppant to move away from the wellbore when optimal natural fracture orientations are encountered. Elementary tests, conducted with the new MPM approach show that fractures oriented in certain directions close to the hydraulic fracture orientation facilitate the proppant placement while other fracture orientations that are perpendicular to the hydraulic fracture or close to perpendicular direction appear to cause screen out. When using the new MPM approach on multiple interacting natural fractures with different orientations the same conclusions observed with one single fractures still hold and only those close to the orientation of the hydraulic fractures promote the placement of the proppant. The application of the new technology to an Eagle Ford well shows that the simulated proppant travels the farthest in the frac stage that is known from other methods and measurements to be the one with the best half fracture length. Furthermore, the examination of the simulated proppant concentration curve versus time shows striking similarities with the actual slurry concentration measured at the same well. These encouraging results show that the macroscopic modeling of proppant distribution using the new MPM technology could help improve our understanding of the complex hydraulic fracturing process and the resulting proppant distribution.|","Material Point Method (MPM), Proppant distribution, Coupled solid fluid Geomechanics, SRV, interaction natural & hydraulic fractures"

Hydraulic fracturing in multi stage horizontal unconventional wells is perhaps one of the most important if not the most important in the drilling and completion cycle of these wells. It's also the most applied technique repeatedly in multiple formations throughout the world and yet the question that looms large over us, do we understand the fracture geometry in these unconventional environments. Year on year most unconventional formations seem to fall in line with the industry trend of increasing lateral lengths and pumping more stages to improve production and recovery. Again, we need to ask ourselves if this is sustainable. Introspection of data available from public data seems to indicate that a significant chunk of these wells buck the trend of increased lateral lengths and stages and we still continue to apply these techniques especially in a price sensitive oil market. What if we could challenge this paradigm through a systematic engineering process that could relate the impact of fracture geometry and well spacing? We selected one of the up and coming plays in Canada that is on the road to development called the Duvernay. 
The Duvernay Formation is a unit of the Woodbend Group and is considered as the source rock for prolific reservoirs such as the Leduc reefs. Duvernay formation holds an estimated 443 trillion cubic feet of gas and 61.7 billion barrels of oil. 
This paper is an attempt to model and understand complex hydraulic fractures in a multi well pad environment coupled with production modelling to understand drainage patterns. Public data from the IHS database was used to construct and build a geocellular model and wells that had petrophysical and geomechanical data were used to build a representative well pad model. Using the model built complex fractures using the unconventional fracture models were simulated in a multi well pad environment. Impact on reservoir drainage has been assessed with various simulations by changing different parameters with respect to hydraulic fracturing. The results of these various simulations are presented in the paper and these simulations act as a tool to understand when possible interference may occur in these pads. Spacing of wells and frac sizes can be adjusted to minimize competitive drainage between wells.|","Duvernay, Well Spacing, Multi well pads, Competitive Drainage, Fracture Geometry"

A new workflow that uses the strain derived from geomechanical modeling of hydraulic fractures interacting with natural fractures is applied to an Eagle Ford well. The derived strain map is used to estimate the asymmetric half lengths that are input in any frac design software able to incorporate this new information. The simplistic symmetric and bi-wing design is revised by adjusting the leakoff coefficient, injection rate, and proppant concentration resulting in asymmetric half lengths that do not exceed the lengths of those provided by the strain map. Once the half lengths and orientation from the frac design match those provided by geomechanical simulation, the propped length and other key results provided by the frac design software may be used to optimize the well's completion. This process could be used iteratively to optimize desired metrics and could also be used to improve reservoir simulation. 
The derived strain map may be propagated in the stimulated geomechanical layer to form a strain volume which may in turn be used to estimate the stimulated permeability. In this paper, we used a radial function to relate the stimulated permeability to the strain within the maximum half lengths provided by the strain map. Two calibration constants are needed in the radial functions and could be estimated by history matching or pressure transient analysis. An adaptive Local Grid Refinement (LGR) and variable stimulated permeability provide a realistic representation of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). After history matching, the resulting pressure distribution allows an accurate selection of refrac or new well candidates, for optimizing well spacing, and for estimating an accurate EUR.|","SRV, reservoir simulation of unconventional wells, geomechanical simulation, propped volume, frac design"

The objective of this paper is to incorporate multi-weakness plane failure into a new anisotropic wellbore stability model for transversely isotropic rock media involving naturally fractured and foliated formations. The model provides a good prediction of wellbore failure, safety angles of weakness planes and estimation of mud weight for drilling optimization. 
The near wellbore stresses are calculated using Lekhnitskii-Amadei (1983) solution. Intact rock matrix failure and multi-weakness plane failure are incorporated to characterize anisotropic rock strength and its failure criterion. The intact rock matrix strength is described using either Mohr-Coulomb criterion or Hoek-Brown criterion. Instead of incorporating single-plane weakness theory, a multi-weakness plane failure model is used to describe joint strength induced by multiple weakness planes. Effects of intermediate principle stress are discussed. Using the proposed model, borehole failures dominated by either weakness planes or in-situ stress induced rock matrix shearing is predicted along the borehole trajectories by coupling with elastic properties from sonic logs. A comparison is made between single weakness plane theory and the proposed model. Results from both methods can be compared and calibrated with caliper logs and borehole image logs (FMI) when available. By extension, estimation of the mud weight window is obtained from the model prediction. Some sensitive analyses of weakness planes distribution, dip angle of weakness planes and horizontal stress orientations are conducted along with mud weight estimation analysis. Data from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) is used for a case study. 
The proposed multi-plane weakness model generates more reliable estimations of borehole failures (as opposed to single weakness plane theory) in high naturally fractured and foliated formations. Mud weight increases with high weakness plane numbers and fracture density. 
Most previous models are based on Jaeger (1929)'s single weakness plane theory, which is affected by intermediate principle stress and does not work well in naturally fractured formations. In practice, results are highly sensitive to azimuth and dip direction of fractures, well inclination and fracture density. The proposed model takes into account all these parameters and consequently provides more accurate results.|","Wellbore Stability, Lekhnitskii-Amadei, Multi-weakness plane, Natural Fractures, Foliated Formations"

Although several researches have been conducted for CO2 injection in shale gas reservoirs, there is definite lack of study that concentrates on the multi-component transport and geomechanical effect. This paper presents shale gas model for CO2 injection considering dissolution, molecular diffusion and stress-dependent permeability as well as multi-component adsorption. Based on information of Barnett shale reservoir, a simulation model is constructed for CO2 flooding. Extended Langmuir isotherm is used to simulate the competitive sorption among the molecules involved. Gas solubility is represented by Henry's law. Co- and counter-diffusive transportsare depicted by Sigmund correlation. Stress-dependent permeability in shale reservoir is considered by exponential correlation with the linear-elastic constitutive model. In the proposed model, the mechanisms and parameters which could influence on CO2 injection are studied. A series of reservoir simulations based on these effects are performed to study effective injection of CO2. 
Mechanisms of CO2 injection in shale gas reservoir contribute to both enhanced CH4 recovery and storage of CO2. Desorption of CH4 in the model with the multi-component adsorption is activated by competitive sorption with the CO2 which is preferentially adsorbed over CH4 with a ratio up to 5:1. Molecular diffusion enables CO2 to displace CH4 in ultra-low matrix permeability condition. The model with molecular diffusion presents wide spread CO2 in the reservoir compared with the model not considering molecular diffusion. Because of ultra-low permeability of shale reservoir, effect of diffusion is higher than conventional reservoirs so that it should be considered in the CO2 injection model of shale reservoir. CO2 injection supports the reservoir pressure so that effect of stress-dependent permeability is mitigated compared with primary recovery model. In this model, CO2 injection improves shale gas recovery about 12%. The CO2 injected in the reservoir exists as a super-critical phase, adsorption trapping, and dissolution trapping of 45.8, 46.5, and 3.6%, respectively. According to reservoir and fracture parameters, amount of each state would be changed. The sensitivity analysis for either enhanced CH4 recovery or CO2 storage is conducted to investigate the critical parameters that control these CO2-EGR process and CO2 storage, respectively. 
This work presents study for mechanisms of CO2 injection in shale gas reservoir taking account of multi-component adsorption, dissolution, molecular diffusion, and geomechanical effect and sensitivity analysis for uncertain parameters of the shale reservoir. The investigation is important for better understanding and design of CO2 injection in order to enhance CH4 recovery and CO2 storage.|","CO2 injection, multi-component transport, enhanced gas recovery, shale gas, geomechanics"

CBM reserves in the United States are estimated at some 450 Tscf. In Australia, CBM resources exceed 300 Tscf, while China has a resource potential greater than the United States and Australia combined. Recent advances in well design and production technology offer scope to significantly increase the proportion of gas contained in coal that can be commercialized. Generally, initial water saturation is 100% within coal seams and gas can only be found as an adsorbed phase inside the coal matrix, so how much adsorbed gas can be released at an economical rate will determine the ultimate gas recovery. The Langmuir isotherm has been widely used in industry to describe the pressure dependence of adsorbed gas. However, temperature dependent adsorption behavior and its major implications for evaluating thermal stimulation as a recovery method for coalbed methane have not been thoroughly explored. Therefore in order to investigate the feasibility of thermal treatment in coal bed methane reservoir successfully, it is crucial to understand the effects of thermal stimulation on the adsorption and desorption phenomenon, and how can we exploit such effects to enhance coalbed methane recovery from hydraulically fractured reservoirs. |In this study, we propose a method to evaluate desorbed gas as a function of pressure and temperature in coal seams, by regression on Langmuir isotherm data. In addition, a CBM reservoir simulator is developed, which is capable of capturing real gas diffusion in the coal matrix and flow in the hydraulic fractures, as well as the heat transfer process within the matrix. This simulator enables us to investigate various thermal stimulation techniques on the global well performance and recovery. |The results of this study show that by increasing the formation temperature, ultimate gas recovery can be improved in CBM reservoirs. The higher the thermal stimulation treatment temperature, the more extra gas can be recovered. However, the efficiency of thermal stimulation is mostly constrained by how much the formation area/volume that can be stimulated in a reasonable period of time. Due to the low heat conductivity of coal, it is not possible to heat up a large drainage area/volume by heating the surface of vertical hydraulic fractures directly. If the heating source (e.g., electromagnetically excited nano-particles) can be dispersed further into the formation through the cleat system during hydraulic fracture execution, then larger formation area/volume can be heated up, depending on how further the nano-particles can be pushed and the arrangement of production (injection) wells. In the case of horizontal fractures, a large formation volume can be thermally stimulated if the fractures can be placed close enough to cover the whole lateral area. Thermal stimulation by hot water/steam injection can increase formation temperature more rapidly than direct element heating methods, especially when the formation permeability is large. Considering large amount of residual adsorption gas still left behind even with low production pressure, thermal stimulation has the potential to enhance CBM recovery substantially if techniques and designs are tailored to the formation properties appropriately.|","hydraulic fracture, Thermal Stimulation, Hydraulic Fracture, Enhanced Recovery, Coalbed Methane"

Reservoirs in the D-18 fields, offshore Sarawak, Malaysia, are a combination of structurally and stratigraphically trapped sand bodies. Potential hydrocarbons are accumulated in the stacked sand bodies separated by weaker sealing shale bodies and regional coal seams. The fields have significantly depleted pressure following several years of production from different reservoir levels. 
Reservoir pressure depletion results in a lower fracture gradient and a narrower drilling mud window. While a lower mud weight is necessary to drill through heavily depleted sands, the lower mud weight may result in excessive wellbore failure in normally pressured, weak formations. A geomechanical assessment is performed to aid coiled tubing horizontal drilling in the depleted reservoirs, which are interbedded with normal-pressure, weak shaly formations. 
A geomechanical model was developed using available data from offset wells. A stress path factor is estimated to model the fracture gradient decrease from production-induced depletion. A safe mud window is optimized using the reduced fracture gradient in depleted sands and the hole collapse pressure in the normal-pressure weak shales. The operational mud window is optimized for hole size and annulus. The wells were drilled successfully using the recommended mud windows, without losses into the depleted sands or hole collapse in weak, normal-pressure formations.

Gas injection in coalbed methane (CBM) resources is a well-studied method. Findings indicate that although Carbon-Dioxide (CO2) injection expedites the Methane desorption process, its high adsorption affinity causes irretrievable permeability reduction. Nitrogen (N2) injection does not have the swelling issue, however, an early breakthrough of the injected gas occurs. Recently, through several simulation-based and experimental studies, it has been shown that a better result is obtained, when a mixture of CO2 and N2 is injected. In these studies, an optimum composition for the injected gas was found, by carrying out a series of sensitivity analyses for the given CBM with known geomechanical and sorption characteristics. In all of these studies, the composition of the injected mixture remains constant within the period of injection. 
In the current work, in order to obtain a better performance, an alternative method is proposed in which the composition of the injected gas is adaptively updated during the injection through several steps. This method can postpone the breakthrough time and also keep well injectivity high. To evaluate the proposed method and find an optimal and practical injection schedule, a semi-synthetic model is constructed. Different injection scenarios are compared with each other, using a compositional simulator (ECLIPSE-300), which uses the extended Langmuir isotherm and the modified Palmer-Mansoori model. The compositional simulation allows us to investigate the sorption competition between each component through the whole system. By a series of sensitivity analyses, an optimum scenario is found. The best obtained scenario, is the one that begins by injecting a mixture with less CO2, and continues by a sequential rise in the CO2 fraction. The outcomes confirm that the proposed method has the following benefits, in comparison with the continuous injection: 1- higher Methane recovery, 2- deferment in permeability reduction, 3- later N2 breakthrough.|","Co2 Injection, Simulation, Gas Injection, Enhance gas Recovery, Coal Bed Methane"

Propagation of fractures, hydraulic fractures included, is accompanied by growth of a certain process zone or ""crack layer"" around the fracture. This process or hydraulically fractured zone (HFZ) can be either smaller or larger depending on the properties of formation. The goal of this paper is to determine how the extent of HFZ depends both on rock properties and operational parameters as well. A better understanding of the HFZ is important because growth of hydraulically fractured zone can significantly increase permeability adjacent to the fracture leading to improved hydrocarbon production. More energy is required to induce an HFZ than just creating the main hydraulic fracture itself but a larger extent of HFZ leads to lower elastic energy for the same cumulative volume of pumped fluid. In order to adequately describe the entire hydraulic fracturing process, all main energy contributions should be taken into account. Traditionally, in using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) to model the hydraulic fracturing process we would predict creation of large planar fracture or even fractures without considering the possibility of developing an HFZ around the main hydraulic fracture. In this paper, a new description of hydraulic fracturing based on the Least Action Principle, is proposed to appropriately account for the potential development of an HFZ. Since hydraulic fracture for Unconventional Resource is induced by injection of large volume of fracturing fluid into tight rock formations, it is therefore convenient to formulate the model in the Rice-Cleary framework where ""undrained"" rock parameters are used. Elastic interaction of the hydraulically fractured zone with surrounding rock is described using Eshelby inclusion approach. It can be demonstrated that when the model is applied to the propagation of a single hydraulic fracture, the model reduces to the conventional (Geertsma-de Klerk) regime of fracture growth. As a result, the extent of the hydraulically fractured zone and its permeability can be expressed in terms of rock properties and key operational parameters (e.g. pumping rate, etc.). Validity of this model will require further work, especially in the laboratory experimental arena as well as analysis of field observations.|","Fractured zone, Permeability, Hydraulic fracturing"

Hydraulic fracturing increases the drainage area and effective permeability of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs by creating a fracture network or stimulated rock volume (SRV) within the reservoir rock. The dimensions of the SRV and its permeability are the key parameters that enhance the unconventional reservoirs' performance after the hydraulic fracture operation. Simulation of the SRV to obtain its dimension and permeability can be used to determine the optimum hydraulic fracture treatment parameters and production. In this study, finite element analysis is employed to determine the SRV characteristics based on field data from a hydraulic fracturing job in a horizontal well penetrating the Glauconite formation in Hoadley field, Alberta, Canada. The dimensions of the SRV are calibrated from the microseismic data. The fracture propagation pressure of the finite element model is matched to the field value by altering the permeability of the SRV. The matched model is used to obtain the in-situ stress changes and the pressure drop within the SRV. The SRV permeability and the pressure drop are used to calculate the aperture, the number, and the spacing of the fractures within the SRV using a semi-analytical approach. The final outputs can be used to optimize the future hydraulic fracture design at the Hoadley field or at other fields that have similar geomechanical properties. It could also be used to predict the reservoir production after the hydraulic fracturing and to provide estimates of changes in the in-situ stresses around the stimulated horizontal wellbore.|","Geomechanic, Hydraulic Fracture, Stimulated Rock Volume, Unconventional Reservoir, Naturally Fractured Reservoir"

During the past decade, there has been a surge in the production of shale oil and this trend is expected to continue in future due to the abundant shale oil reserve. Currently, one main issue with shale oil production is the low primary recovery factors still less than 10%. Therefore, efficient enhanced oil recovery methods are highly desired to improve shale oil recovery. As an essential component of shale, kerogen plays a key role in generation, adsorption, storage and migration of hydrocarbons in shale as well as the geomechanical properties of shale. On the other hand, during the shale oil extraction process, shale oil can be produced from kerogen by pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution reactions. The basis to improve the efficiency of both recovery and extraction processes is to establish and clarify the molecular structure of kerogen. Previously, some 2D molecular structures of kerogen have been proposed based on some characterization techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrospcoy. However, the physical and chemical properties of kerogen are essentially determined by its 3D stereochemical molecular configuration. 
In this work, according to the 2D molecular structure of Green River oil shale kerogen from literature, a 3D solid state model of kerogen was built based on molecular dynamics(MD) simulation method. The kerogen of Green River oil shale is a mixture of seven molecules that are held together by physical adsorption mechanism. This kerogen belongs to type I based on O/C (0.026) and H/C (1.57) ratios. An adsorption method was applied to combine the seven molecules together. By changing the adsorption sequences of the seven molecules, a total of 24 possible 3D nanocluster models of kerogen were obtained. Then the 3D nanocluster structure with the lowest energy was further applied to build the solid state model of kerogen at 298k under 1 atm based on a MD simulation method. The final 3D solid state model of kerogen was used to calculate the density, mechanical properties, NMR, IR and Raman spectra of kerogen. The theoretical results agree well with the experimental data. The density from the 3D structure was calculated as 0.968 g/cm3 which falls in the range of experimental results from 0.95 to 1.45 g/cm3. The calculated Young's modulus, Poisson ratio, compressibility, bulk modulus and shear modulus are 3.50 GPa, 0.25, 370.64 TPa-1, 2.63 GPa and 1.37 GPa respectively that matches the experimental results very well. The calculated spectral data are also in accord with the experimental results. These results will help us better understand the physical and chemical properties of Green River oil shale kerogen. Moreover, the calculated properties of kerogen can be applied to implement new techniques or improve existing methods for enhancing oil recovery from shale oil resources.|","molecular dynamics simulation, unconventional reservoir EOR, kerogen 3D molecular model, shale oil and gas, density, mechanical properties, NMR spectra"

In the past decade the industry has embraced unconventional resources; namely, shale oil and shale gas. After the initial drill-to-hold stage, multiwell pad drilling and stimulations are employed to exploit the acreage. Zipper fracturing is a technique that reduces the standby time (up to 50% reduction, when combined with the plug-and-perf isolation method). Because of this operational efficiency improvement, zipper fracturing has become one of the most common fracturing practices for unconventional reservoir stimulation. It has also been purported to increase production, which several authors have previously reported. There are also other studies showing no benefit of zipper fracturing on production performance. 
In this paper we have used a complex fracture network model, which we refer to as the Unconventional Fracture Model (UFM), to study zipper fracturing. The model simulates complex (branched) fracture propagation, associated stress shadows, fluid flow, and proppant transportation in the complex fracture network. The model solves the fully coupled problem of fluid flow in the fracture network and elastic deformation of the fracture. A key difference between UFM and the conventional planar fracture model is being able to simulate the interaction of hydraulic fractures with preexisting natural fractures (also referred as planes of weakness). The UFM simulates interwell and interstage stress shadows and honors both sequential fracturing and zipper fracturing scenarios' geomechanical interaction. 
In this paper, we present the results of a zipper and sequential fracturing study that includes the completion design optimization and the associated production performance in the Eagle Ford Shale. The study provides a workflow to optimize the completion and stimulation designs in pad development and to improve rate of return. The quantitative results show that zipper fracturing may not deliver a production benefit when compared with sequential fracturing and is a function of well spacing and perforation cluster spacing in a given area.|","Unconventional Fracture Model, Zipper Fracturing, Stress Shadow, Shale Oil, Eagle Ford"

Recent drilling of moderately to highly deviated development wells in the Kilo Field has proven to be extremely challenging. Numerous lost-time incidents including stuck pipe, pack-off, and difficulties in running casing were experienced, particularly when drilling through the Main-Massive Formation. Earlier analyses pointed to mud material quality issues, but drilling performance benchmarking with other nearby fields ruled out this explanation. Faced with continually high NPTs, a geomechanical study was initiated to mitigate the wellbore instability problems. The recommendations arising from the comprehensive geomechanical and drilling experience analyses have been implemented to improve performance during subsequent development drilling. 
The field-wide geomechanical model indicates the Kilo Field is characterized by a state of stress that is transitional between a normal and strike-slip faulting regimes. The combination of relatively large differential stress and relatively weak rocks means the field is potentially subject to stress-induced wellbore instability problems. However, observations of numerous time-dependent failures imply secondary influences must also be considered to arrive at possible remediation strategies. A systematic ranking process has been developed to delineate the primary causal mechanism of wellbore instability. This process suggests that the major contributor to the time-dependent deterioration process is rising pore pressure caused by the invasion of drilling fluid into micro-fractured formations, and then exacerbated by less-than-optimal drilling practices. This finding, together with the improved geomechanical understanding of the Kilo Field, provides the basis for optimizing mud weights and wellbore trajectories as well as formulating appropriate drilling strategies to maintain the mud hydrostatic support (overbalance) in future drilling. The finding also highlights the importance of integrating geomechanics with drilling practices when developing strategies to mitigate unstable hole problems. 
This paper presents a comprehensive, ordered workflow that integrates the disparate data available in a mature field to identify the most likely causative mechanisms of the time-delayed wellbore instabilities. This knowledge was then used to develop strategies for optimizing future drilling operations in the Kilo Field.|","Drilling Performance, Drilling Optimization, Non-Productive Times, Geomechanics, Wellbore Stability"

Drilling into deepwater prospects of South East Asia have been very challenging especially in NW Borneo and subsurface hazards related to pore pressure and wellbore stability remain the greatest obstacle. A myriad of wellbore issues have led to failure of some wells to reach geological targets and the drilling cost as high as US$100 million (as of 2014) is not uncommon in the area. It is important to be able to understand the geological nature of pore pressure mechanism in deepwater Sundaland continental margin (DSCM) and thus redefine pore pressure prediction strategy in the area to better align with the regional characteristics. 
The currently established empirical effective stress-based pore pressure prediction is dissected to reveal its pitfalls especially regarding its application to DSCM. Compaction mechanism assumptions are also revisited in depth. Three wells from a deepwater field in Northwest Borneo are used as a case study to demonstrate the distinct overpressure nature of the area. 
This study confirms that DSCM not only exhibits overpressure profile typical to deepwater anywhere else, but also possesses distinct geopressure characteristics related to its unique geological setting, most notably the active compressional shortening of the mega thrust-fold belts accompanied by continuous rapid deltaic sediment deposition. As a result, unique geopressure-related challenges prevail in this area, such as: shallow top of overpressure, the failure of standard empirical compaction methods, and prominent centroid phenomenon. 
It is successfully demonstrated that the shallow top of overpressure of DSCM is linked to rapid sedimentation of low permeability sediments; undrained tectonic shearing is the central cause of common underestimation of popular effective-stress based pore pressure prediction method; and that the dominance of compressional geological structures explains the high likelihood of centroid effect.|","Sundaland, Pore Pressure, Deepwater, Overpressure, South East Asia"

Anoperatorin Baku, Azerbaijan was planning to create a gas lift configuration and needed to perforate 7-in., 32-lbf, 13% chrome, up to 0.51-in.wall thickness, heavy wall tubingwithout explosives. A nonexplosive mechanical tubing perforator conveyed on electric line avoided damaging the in-situ control lines and the casing. To meet the job parameters, a mechanical tubing perforator capable of generating up to 100,000 lbf necessary to perforate the 7-in. tubing was developed. 
The 7-in. downhole electrical power generator actuated tubing perforator tool provided a controlled, nonexplosive, cost-effective solution to create a single perforation hole in tubing or casing without damaging in-situ control lines in the annulus. Tubing to annulus communication was established and through-tubing gas lift straddle was installed to allow increased production. When workover requirements necessitate rapid mobilization, the tubing perforator helps lower costs while providing a safe, effective, and dependable solution for perforating the tubing. Offering conveyance flexibility, the perforator can be run on slickline, electric line, or coiled tubing (CT), providing versatility and economy to meet multiple operational requirements. 
This actuated tubing perforator eliminates logistical challenges associated with using explosives, is health, safety, and environment (HSE) and user friendly, and helps reduce rig time by minimizing missed runs. It is compact and heli-lift compliant for portable, rapid deployment and has no risk of damaging annular tubular or casing. Relying on the dependable performance of the tool to provide power, the actuated tubing perforator has proven to be a safe, reliable, and cost-effective means of punching production tubular for circulating purposes. 
Acquiring, moving, storing, and handling explosive-based equipment can be very difficult and time-consuming. In many countries where regional security is a concern, the movement of explosives is a controlled activity and can often delay projects. Consequently, when an unplanned event occurs for which pipe severing with explosives is the solution, such as stuck pipe, the drilling rig team might be required to wait several days before performing this job. These types of occurrences are quite common, especially in highly active drilling areas. In some cases, this lost time is conservatively estimated to be more than USD 12 million annually for a land-based operation. It is easily plausible to incur triple these costs for offshore operations, noting that these cost estimates do not account for the revenue losses attributable to a delay in production of hydrocarbons. 
Wells in the Middle East, both onshore and offshore, often require workover because of the highly corrosive environment to which the downhole equipment is subjected. During these operations, the downhole equipment frequently must be repaired or replaced. To maintain well control during these workovers, a single hole is often necessaryto allow the kill fluids to be circulated. Traditionally, these holes are created using explosives and a soft shot perforator or usingmechanical hole-punching methods. These types of solutions can also damage the tubing or casing, causing further issues. Workover jobs requiring a single hole to be punched are often economically compromised by delays in mobilizing explosives and because failures to perforate soft tubing are common when using traditional mechanical hole-punching methods.|","dpu actuated tubing perforator, Non-explosive, Mechanical perforator, DPU, Perforator"

The learning curve has evolved in the last few years for operators in shale plays. Early wells started with relatively large cluster spacing and small proppant volumes resulting in suboptimal initial completions. Over the years, perforation cluster spacing has declined. Consequently, the number of hydraulic fracturing stages has increased. The total proppant pumped per lateral foot has also increased. The majority of the existing wells were completed with geometrically spaced multiple perforation clusters per stage. Sometimes more than six clusters per stage have been employed. Studies have shown that one-third of these perforation clusters are not productive (Miller et al., 2011). Noncontributing perforation clusters could be due to not initiating hydraulic fractures, insufficient proppant placement, or loss of near-wellbore connection due to over-flushing or severe drawdown. Furthermore, during the development phase, the depletion from parent wells leads to asymmetric hydraulic fracture growth on closely spaced infill wells. Parent wells may also be negatively impacted due to hydraulic fracture interference from new completions. These factors have led to poor hydrocarbon recovery factors, sometimes less than 10% in horizontal shale wells. 
Recovery factors from existing wells can be improved through restimulation. Candidate selection is a key in achieving economically successful restimulation. Restimulation of appropriate horizontal shale wells resulted in significant production uplifts based on early field results. Designing a fit-for-purpose restimulation treatment is dependent on initial completion, offset well distance, infill plan, and, above all, economics. On top of the design aspect, operationally achieving effective restimulation on long horizontal wells with tens of perforation clusters is a challenging task. Thus real-time monitoring and control is a key for field execution. 
This work uses an integrated petrophysical, geomechanical, hydraulic fracture, and reservoir modeling workflow and field observations to develop restimulation strategies for improving hydrocarbon recovery. This integrated workflow includes a multistep calibration process to reduce uncertainty. One of the key calibration steps is to model hydraulic fracture growth accounting for local geological heterogeneity and match with observed treatment parameters and microseismic interpretations. Another critical calibration step includes automatic gridding of hydraulic fracture geometry to run numerical reservoir simulation to match realized production results. Reservoir pressure distribution at the end of the production history is used to recalculate stresses for modeling the refracturing scenarios. 
Multiple practical refracturing scenarios were constructed for addressing near-wellbore connectivity issues and ineffective drainage along the lateral. Creating new surface area in undrained rock and restoring productivity of existing hydraulic fractures resulted in higher recovery. Higher proppant amounts in undrained rock on one well pad or laterals with wider well spacing improved recovery. However, larger jobs can lead to significant interference for closely spaced wells. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates that properly designed restimulation treatments lead to improved recovery.|","Restimulation, Shale, Modeling, Refracturing, Horizontal"

During hydraulic fracturing process, the formation undergoes significant changes in the net stress as a result of the fluid injection and retrieval. These stress changes impact the formation petrophysical properties including permeability, porosity, and the compressibility. In this experimental study, the impact of geomechanical changes on shales petrophysical properties is investigated using a laboratory set-up that was designed and assembled for fast and robust shale core plug porosity and permeability measurements under steady-state conditions. This laboratory set-up is capable of accurately measuring shale core plug ultra-low permeability and porosity because it has a resolution of one millionth standard cubic centimeters per second for gas flow rate and one hundredth cubic centimeters for pore volume measurement. The laboratory set-up allows measurements to be performed under isothermal conditions by automated temperature control. The application of the confining pressure on the shale core plug allows permeability and porosity to be measured under a wide range of net stress. 
A sequential set of experiments were performed in this study. During the first set of experiments, the permeability of the core plug was measured by increasing the net stress from 500 psia to 7,900 psia followed by decreasing net stress from 7,900 psia to the initial net stress condition. The next three sets of experiments repeated the same steps as the first set on the same core plug. However, during the third set only the porosity, and during the fourth set only permeability was measured. 
The measured porosity and permeability values from the experiments clearly exhibited hysteresis with the net stress changes. The hysteresis was more pronounced for permeability than it was for porosity. Since the permeability changes were non-linear with respect to net stress changes, Walsh method was used to estimate the fracture closure pressure. The results indicate that sequential net stress changes can cause a reduction in fracture closure pressure. This reduction however tends to diminish with increasing number of sequential stress changes. Finally, comparing the porosity and permeability measurements revealed two distinctive behavioral changes for both porosity and permeability that can be contributed to the natural fracture and matrix properties.|","Geomechanics, Organic-Rich Shales, Matrix-Fracture Characterization"

To model hydraulic fracture propagation in naturally fractured reservoirs, fracture propagation is generally assumed to be a single planar fracture propagated only in the vertical direction from a horizontal well, regardless of the presence of natural fractures. In this paper, we developed a multi-stage hydraulic fracture propagation model using a twisted multiple planar fracture that is able to describe the propagation of hydraulic fractures more realistically. In propagating hydraulic fractures, we used two criteria: maximum tangential stress, to determine the fracture initiation angle, and whether a hydraulic fracture passes through a natural fracture. The developed model was used with a commercial reservoir simulator through grid mapping in the form of a discrete fracture network using microseismic data. The results of the verification matched the experimental results well for various intersection angles and maximum horizontal stress directions. In the investigation of the direction of maximum horizontal stress, the frictional coefficient of the fracture interface, and fracture orientation, hydraulic fracture propagation modeling results showed that the hydraulic fracture passed through a natural fracture, and thereafter propagated in a manner suitably consistent with the theoretical results, based on a fracture interaction criterion. After confirming the twisted multiple planar fracture model suggested in this work, discrepancies were found in the fracture connectivity and the stimulated reservoir volume. This indicates that the twisted multiple planar fracture approach, which is more realistic in terms of fracture propagation, is extremely important in evaluating the initial gas in place, calculated according to the stimulated reservoir volume.|","twisted multiple planar fracture, geomechanical factor, hydraulic fracture propagation, shale gas, natural fracture"

This study presents the results of an empirical modeling approach using integrated multidisciplinary measurements to optimize completion methodologies and future field development for stacked laterals. The objective is to ultimately high-grade basin-wide exploratory Wolfcamp landing zones from 3D seismic data. Shale mineralogy compositions and geomechanical properties are directly measured from 3D surface seismic data along lateral well trajectories at individual hydraulically stimulated stages which are monitored real-time using microseismic acquisition. Extrapolated lateral synthetic logs from 3D seismic of said shale properties, combined with microseismic and completions data, are numerically modeled to simulate hydraulic fractures for optimal completions design. Successful implementation is critical in landing areas with complex depositional environments characteristic of laterally varying mineralogy compositions and rock mechanics. 
The method is tested in the prolific oil-bearing Wolfcamp shale-oil play of the Midland Basin, West Texas, on three laterals drilled in a ""chevron pattern"", two of which in the deeper Wolfcamp B formation and the third in the Wolfcamp A. Real-time microseismic monitoring is used to measure the spatial and temporal evolution of the stimulation. Although identical pumping schedules are initially intended for all three laterals stimulated in a ""zipper sequence"", with geometric stage placement, it becomes apparent that mapped microseismic height varied significantly across the given laterals at individual stages with no apparent relationship with treatment injection rates. 
However, post-frac analyses of the microseismic and petrophysical data shows strong correlations between fracture height variability with: 1) lateral changes in shale facies and subsequent mineralogy composition, and 2) P-wave and S-wave log impedances which are ultimately tied to the 3D surface seismic data. Optimal fracture heights are observed in landing areas with significant volume of calcite, regions of high Young's modulus and closure stress. Production history match of those laterals and several others in the field confirms a strong correlation between seismic P- and S-wave impedance and initial 120-day-cumulative oil in landing zones where high volume of calcite exists. 
Further field development of stacked laterals requires optimal containment of fracture heights within pay zones, requiring an innovative integrated workflow. This involves the incorporation of 3D seismic with microseismic data which should be used to calibrate fracture modeling simulations for an optimized stimulation treatment schedule (i.e., volumes pumped with optimal slurry rates, etc.) Synthetic lateral logs from 3D seismic, representing estimated measurements of petrophysical and geomechanical rock properties can also be used to develop an engineered completion solution for cluster placement and stage spacing.|","Unconventional fracture simulations, Integration, Completion and stimulation optimization, Microseismic Monitoring, 3D seismic"

Unconventional shale-gas reservoirs are usually highly laminated with vertical and lateral heterogeneity. The elastic mechanical properties are highly anisotropic along the different orientations parallel and perpendicular to the bedding. The formation heterogeneity, elastic anisotropy, and structural complexity affect the stress field both near and far from the wellbore and thus the fracture containment, fracture initiation pressure, and breakdown pressure. A better understanding of the formation properties and in-situ stress can be achieved by an advanced logging program. Many studies have shown improved production in the lateral wells by implementing an engineered completion design using advanced sonic logs and other high-tier logs. The importance of understanding these properties in the lateral wells also raised questions including whether we can predict lateral log responses from pilot wells and whether the formation is laterally homogenous. 
In this study, we compared the projected lateral logs from pilot wells with the actual lateral logs to shed insights on the important question of formation heterogeneity. Different techniques were applied including a gamma ray method and an advanced 3D near-well structural model. The 3D model took advantage of the valuable information from borehole geology interpretation of image logs such as bedding, fractures, and faults to build high-resolution near-well structures. It was then used as a framework to model the reservoir properties and far-field stress using methods including a layer-cake and a finite-element approach. The output of the model showed the lateral heterogeneity of the reservoir by comparing the lateral section with the pilot well. 
The reservoir properties from these techniques described above were then incorporated and evaluated as part of the completion design workflow, which focused on both near-wellbore and far-field modeling. The results showed the benefits and limitations of each propagating modeling technique for optimizing the completion design and shed light on the realization of being able to project the pilot logs across a single horizontal well or an entire pad.|","project pilot log, 3D structural model, far-field stress, completion design, lateral heterogeneity"

Growth in unconventional shale development and its associated flow-back water disposal needs have led to significant demands for brine disposal wells in the Appalachian Basin. The Ordovician-Cambrian age Knox Group Carbonates and Clastics includes several formations utilized for brine disposal in the Northern Appalachian Basin. The depth of the Knox Group injection intervals changes significantly in the basin, from outcroppings to potentially over 15,000 feet. The significant depth change causes variation in porosity, permeability, and elastic properties in the Knox Group and caprocks that should be analyzed for estimating injection capacity across the region. 
To study petrophysical and rock mechanical behavior with increasing depth, we selected eight wells whose depths of injection intervals in the Knox Group and the overlying caprock formations are progressively deeper to the east. The first step is building scatter plots to understand how petrophysical characteristics, including sonic wave velocity, density-neutron porosity, and gamma ray data, are related to each other. Then, multivariate linear regression is used to determine compressional and shear wave velocity as a function of other petrophysical parameters. The t-statistic for each coefficient in the correlation tests the null hypothesis to show significance of coefficients. The dynamic mechanical properties are also determined using dipole sonic and density logs across the region. 
We investigate the effect of depth on the relationship between petrophysical parameters, and we study the variations in trends that may be caused by geological events. While the large variation of petrophysical parameters in the Rose Run Sandstone shows the important effect of formation cementation and consolidation by depth, the limited variability of petrophysical parameters in the Copper Ridge Dolomite injection interval proves that its characteristics are not dependent on depth. The effect of petrophysical variation shows its direct effect on rock mechanical properties that its distribution is limited in Copper Ridge Dolomite in comparison to Rose-Run Sandstone. In addition, where the Knox unconformity is present, there exists a completely different relationship between petrophysical parameters for the injection intervals below it and the main caprocks above it. While the content of gamma ray affects formation characteristics above the unconformity, such a trend was not seen in formations below it. 
With focus on injection into sub-Knox unconformity formations, understanding petrophysical parameter variations in the injection and caprock intervals seems necessary. Our results indicate that using statistical plots and regression provides an opportunity to understand the relationship between multiple numbers of petrophysical parameters with significant amounts of data. The derived correlations could also be used to determine mechanical properties for the geomechanical analysis across the region, especially when dipole sonic logs are not available.|","Northern Appalachian Basin, Knox Group Reservoirs and Caprocks, Petrophysical Analysis, Geomechanical Analysis"

It is very important to predict well performance of unconventional reservoirs before designing a field development plan. Although these reservoirs have high initial production rates, it is common that their production performance decline faster than conventional reservoirs. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the reasons behind the reduction of production performance. One of these reasons is the increase in stress as a result of continuing production and decrease in pore pressure. 
The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to model the effects of stress-dependent permeability for both hydraulic and natural fractures on the production performance of shale gas reservoirs. We generate a new stress-dependent compaction table to history match the performances of a single well in Haynesville formation. We also investigate the optimum operation conditions at which no sever reduction in production performance occurs. 
The results of more than 50 simulation cases indicate that stress-dependent properties (permeability and porosity) have a significant effect on reservoir performance. The study also indicate that hydraulic fractures lose over 90% of its permeability with most of the permeability loss occurring at late time of production. The study also shows that we can delay the effect of stress-dependent properties by either increasing initial hydraulic fracture conductivity or operating wells at low drawdown pressure.|","Stress dependent permeability, Geo-mechanical effects, production performance"

Proppant distribution directly affects the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing treatment, and significantly impact well production. In most situations, proppants are not uniformly distributed in hydraulic fractures and most proppants cannot be effectively transported into the far ends of fractures from wellbore. As a result of uneven proppant distribution and the ductile and soft geomechanical properties of the Marcellus shale, the reduction in hydraulic fracture conductivity varies greatly from cluster to cluster in a shale reservoir during reservoir pressure depletion. However, the influences of accurate prediction of uneven proppant distribution in hydraulic fractures and geomechanics on well productivity have been ignored in previous simulation studies. 
In this study, a reservoir simulation model for accurate prediction of uneven proppant distribution is developed. This dual-permeability model is coupled with reservoir geomechanics to illustrate the interaction of stress changing and multiphase flow within hydraulic fractures. History matching from a production well in the Marcellus shale is performed to validate our model. In addition, simulations using different matrix permeability are performed to demonstrate the impact of matrix permeability, along with the effect of proppant distributions and geomechanical properties on well performance. 
The simulation results show that gas production varies significantly due to different proppant distribution and geomechanical properties. Coupled geomechanical simulation results clearly indicate that the proppant embedding effects are also noticeable due to soft rock mechanical properties and uneven proppant distribution.

This paper has been dedicated to the optimization of multi-stage hydraulic fracturing by providing a more thorough understanding of fracture and reservoir stress behavior. This is accomplished by the use of a fully coupled fracture propagation simulator that couples fracture mechanics and fluid dynamics, unlike past studies, which observe only simple interactions. The underlying objective is to eliminate the misappropriated energy caused by inter-fracture stress interaction and stress reorientation surrounding the induced fracture network by assessing stress magnitude as a function of operation conditions. 
This study is based upon an in-house numerical simulation model developed for hydraulic fracture propagation based upon the linear elastic fracture mechanic ""LEFM"" using finite element method. The elastic response of the 2-D solid medium and the fluid flow within the fracture is coupled to provide a more realistic depiction of these interactions. The magnitude of stress variation and reorientation is calculated in surrounding areas of simultaneous and sequential hydraulic fracturing of a horizontal well for a wide range of hydraulic fracturing propagation regimes for both homogenous and compositional models. 
Our study clearly shows that there is an optimum distance between hydraulic fractures below which, the change (variation) in magnitude and orientation of stresses leads to significant change in fracture geometry and propagation rate. This has been impacted mainly through mechanical interaction that leads to higher compressive stress concentrations between fractures. The mechanical interaction becomes stronger by increasing the number of fractures or altering the fracture spacing. The effects have also been investigated in a composite reservoir model with different mechanical properties (i.e., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio), and operational conditions, such as injection rate and volume. Mechanical properties of different layers in a composite reservoir model significantly impact the fracture geometry and propagation rate when the fracture intercepts different layer boundaries. The magnitude of change in stresses and stress reorientation is also quantified in cross sections with respect to the fracture plane as the fracture propagates. 
This study provides an advanced understanding of multiple hydraulic fracturing stimulation and dynamics of fracture geometry, propagation rate and stress change in surrounding using our unique fully coupled hydraulic fracturing simulator. Moreover, it provides quantitative analysis of induced stresses and in-situ stress reorientation.

When calculating the downhole stresses affecting a wellbore during depletion it has become a standard industry practice to assume only the pore pressure changes, and not the rock mechanical properties. This assumption has the potential to underestimate the total horizontal stress (Sh) causing unrealistic fracture containment. It will also overestimate the effective horizontal stress (Sh' = Sh - Biot * Pore Pressure) for open-hole wellbore failure. High effective horizontal stress assumption can potentially transform rock from brittle to ductile behavior and failure mechanics from shear to compaction and the model becomes overly conservative. Ductile and compaction failure can cause changes in well integrity, as well as changes in fracture geometry from offset infill wells. This paper will document changes in rock properties in the Bakken formation during variable depletion (10% to 65%) and recalculate rock properties (velocities, mechanical properties - Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Biot's anisotropic compressibility constant) as a function of effective stress due to production in order to accurately calculate fracture geometry at an offset well and parent well bore integrity. Hydraulic fracturing simulations are performed to simulate well communication between the fractured well and the depleted parent well along with the potential to re-fracture the parent well using the pore pressure, linear, and non-linear models. Laboratory testing performed on rock samples is shown to validate the non-linear model.|","Depletion, Mohr Coulomb, Total stress, Ben Eaton, effective stress"

Successful production from unconventional reservoirs requires expensive hydraulic fracturing operations that are not only costly but pose environmental and health risks if not managed properly. Optimized use of microseismic imaging is essential to control the hydraulic fracture operation, to minimize any possible environmental hazards introduced by fracturing, and to achieve cost efficiency. 
An integrated workflow that incorporates advanced geophysical techniques is presented in this paper to enhance microseismic imaging of hydraulic fracturing in unconventional resources in Saudi Arabia. The use of surface seismic attributes is suggested to primarily minimize location uncertainties of microseismic events; whether downhole or surface receivers arrays were used. Secondly, coherence and edge attributes are used to highlight faults and seismic-scale fractures in seismic volumes, knowledge of which may favorably infer the ""geomechanical"" maximum horizontal stress direction; hence the main direction of fluid flow within targeted sediments and a preliminary conception of hydraulically induced fractures' direction of propagation. Moreover, knowledge of fault networks in reservoirs is vital to pinpoint potential barriers that may impact the growth of fractures, and their likely geometries. 
Seismic attributes are combined with acoustic impedance inversion volumes, Vp/Vs and Poisson ratios to further enhance inferences to hydrocarbon bearing, and sediment brittleness. These methods can be used collectively to optimize multi-staged hydraulic fracturing of unconventional reservoirs, which will eventually lead to limiting stimulation to only selected ""producible"" sweet spots, thus minimizing the required number of ""fracking"" stages and associated environmental and financial concerns. These methods should also drive the use of more economic stimulation solutions using low-proppant, high-flow-rate, and water based treatments (Gale, et. al., 2007).|","Microseismic, Hydraulic Fractures"

V., Baker Hughes International| Shinde, A. L., Baker Hughes International| Imtiaz, S., Baker Hughes International","|Abstract 
The well design has been changed over last 55 years of development in Zubair Formation. It is the deepest producing Cretaceous reservoir in North Kuwait. This 1,400 ft thick formation was deposited in deltaic to Paralic depositional environments with complex sand/shale sequence, structural geometry, mineralogical composition and lateral extent. Drilling wells of any profile has been more difficult than the shallower reservoirs overlying it. The wells have witnessed high non-productive time due to severe wellbore instability issues in the form of stuck pipes, tight holes, hole pack-offs and jarring/fishing operations. During initial phase lasting over 4 decades, vertical wells were drilled to drain the oil column which was thicker in most part of the Field. With water encroachments from bottom and edge, thinner pay Sands in multiple but thin pays are needed to be exploited by maximizing reservoir contact with high angle multi-lateral wells for effective production. 
Drilling complications are inherent in Zubair since beginning even with vertical and deviated wells. Current transition to horizontal and high angle wells was possible with integrated studies. In the first phase of mitigating stability, responsible failure mechanisms for wellbore were identified: stress induced breakouts, washouts and cavings, failure and fluid invasion associated with shale bedding planes at high deviation and osmotic pressure transmission between Zubair shales and drilling fluid system. Water sensitivity of clays and presence of micro-fractures were also studied on cores of this trouble making formation. In the second phase, calibrated well based 1D Geomechanical models; 3D structural model with high definition faults, facies models indicating lithological changes and drilling experience of latest high angle wells were integrated into a 3D Geomechanical model. The model was tested with data from several offset wells and it was capable of explaining the wellbore failure of these wells. It was used predicting mud weight window for any proposed high angle well trajectories. 
Mitigation measures from the study included drilling with Oil Based Mud or High performance water based mud systems with model derived mud weights, micronized sealing polymer to seal-off the laminations and micro-fractures, marble grade Calcium carbonate or resilient graphite to plug wider fractures and high salinity of mud to avoid time-sensitive osmotic flow. 
The integrated study was implemented and six horizontal wells and a highly deviated well have been drilled successfully. The well designs and trajectories have been modified to drill along different azimuths of stress field with turns and up dip/down dip movements. Structurally complex and faulted blocks could be crossed effortlessly. The study has given further confidence to implement an aggressive field development plan for optimal depletion of undrained areas. Current strategy is to have vertical and deviated wells also for thicker reservoirs as they have the advantage of well interventions. 
The paper discusses complex reservoir architecture, drilling complications and how the integrated study helped to achieve a breakthrough in development planning.|","paralic reservoirs, well bore stability, mature reservoir"

The North Kuwait Carbonate (NKJG) reservoirs are currently under development by KOC (Kuwait Oil Company). The appraisal and development of the NKJG offer challenges such as lateral variations in reservoir quality, tight to very tight reservoirs and natural fracturing to a varying degree spatially. The presence of open, connected fractures is one of the key elements to achieve a successful development. Also, the presence of fracture corridors increase the risk associated with drilling. Numerous fracture modelling studies have been supporting both appraisal and development strategies of the fields. This paper illustrates how small scale detailed DFN (Discrete Fracture Network) can support the planning and drilling activities of future appraisal wells. A series of detailed DFN models has been built around existing wells. The DFN models are based on a thorough structural understanding, detailed fracture characterization using bore-hole image (BHI) and core data around the wells of interests. In addition to the fracture characterization work, mechanical stratigraphy has been elaborated using E-facies and geomechanical logs. Fracture connectivity analysis has been carried out to calibrate the DFNs to the static and dynamic well data. Scenarios of DFN models can now be used to communicate with drilling in order to illustrate the potential fracture corridors distribution in the sub-surface.|","DFN Modelling, Drilling activities, Fractures, Kuwait, Carbonate"

The Shell Global Solutions organisation has included a small waterflood improvement and consultancy team since 2003, tasked with improving the operational performance of the Shell Group1's waterflood operations. Throughout this period structured reviews of waterflood assets and development projects have been carried out in operated and non-operated ventures and for projects where Shell has acted as advisor, across the globe. The actions and learning items that have come out of these reviews have been documented and the resulting database provides a valuable resource. 
Some 119 structured reviews have been analysed that cover a variety of projects, from those in development planning where waterflood was under evaluation through to waterfloods that had been in operation for many years. While reviewers have varied over the 12 year period covered, the structure of the reviews has remained remarkably consistent. Reviews are run as structured discussions with a wide cross-section of the asset- or project-team, from geologists to operations staff. The review ‘follows the water’ from source through the treatment facilities, injection well, reservoir and production well and production facilities to disposal or reuse. Action items are triggered during the discussions and evaluated for urgency and impact to aid in prioritization for action. 
The actions have been categorized into 18 separate areas, each related to the different parts of the integrated waterflood system. Of these, 3 categories together account for more than one third of the high priority action items. A project's injection philosophy – whether to inject under matrix or fractured injection – triggers the most discussion and action items; moreover this proportion has remained almost constant over the 12 year period studied. Distilled from this data are indications that delayed transfer of technical knowledge may contribute to this, but also that the number of actions reflects a growing level of sophistication in specific areas, such as geomechanics and waterflood-induced fracture behaviour. The other two ‘big actor’ categories; future development options and plans and the operation of surface facilities have also shown persistently high levels of actions being generated over the years, over the full range of project types. 
The implications are clear for those involved in managing waterflood performance improvement: Knowledge transfer and the ongoing education of technical staff remains a challenge but must continue to be improved, while integration of operations staff into the effort can bring the improvements in uptime performance and throughput needed to unlock other development opportunities. 
The waterflood health-checks and the learnings taken from them make a key contribution to the improvement in injection performance in Shell's waterfloods. Quite apart from an assurance role, these reviews are arguably even more important as an educational and a knowledge management tool. The health-checks closely compliment the organizational changes that have been put in place to enhance operational focus on existing waterfloods and to improve waterflood design in new projects, and which have shown significant results in improving the performance of operating assets.|","waterflood improvement, knowledge transfer, capability"

Recent studies have shown that more than 50% of wells that are 15 years old or older have at least one casing string with sustained casing pressure. Cement sheath failure will result in sustained casing pressure, cross flow, lost production, collapsed casing, contaminated water zones and increased workover costs. Today, US federal regulation do not allow wells with sustained annular pressure to be plugged and abandoned. Remediation in these cases is both difficult and expensive. Therefore, utilizing a cement formulation which repairs itself in case of any failure under downhole conditions would be ideal for ensuring long-term well integrity and preventing the occurrence of sustained casing pressure. The objective of this paper is to review the self-sealing cement technology presented in the literature. This study manifests the latest novel laboratory equipment which allowed the cement to cure, get cracked and then seal under downhole conditions. The hydrophilic essence of this material provides a durable cement sheath to help ensure well integrity and zonal isolation for the life of the well. Mechanical properties testing could demonstrat the improved tensile to compressive strength ratio, lower Young's modules and higher Poisson's ratio. In addition, self sealing cement could self seal multiple times and therefore deliver a durable cement sheath in a wide variety of field cases.|","Well Integirty, Long-term Zonal Isolation, Environment, Self-Sealing Cement, Novel Method"

In the past decade, Fiber-Optic (FO) based sensing has opened up opportunities for in-well reservoir surveillance in the oil and gas industry. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) has been used in applications such as steam front monitoring in thermal EOR and injection conformance monitoring in waterflood projects using (improved) warmback analysis and FO based pressure gauges are deployed commonly. In recent years1 significant progress has also been made to mature other, new FO based surveillance methods such as the application of Distributed Strain Sensing (DSS) for monitoring reservoir compaction and well deformation, multidrop Distributed Pressure Sensing (DPS) for fluid level determination, and Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) for geophysical and production/injection profiling. For the latter application, numerous field surveys were conducted to develop the evaluation algorithms or workflows which convert the DAS noise recordings into flow rates from individual zones. The applicability of a new graphical user-interface has been expanded to include smart producers and injectors that allows the user to visualize (in real time), QC and evaluate the DAS data. Also, the evaluation methods for the use of DTS for warmback analysis have been significantly improved. 
There are still improvements to be made in enabling Distributed Sensing infrastructure, such as handling and evaluation of very large data volumes, seamless FO data transfer, the robustness & cost of the FO system installation in subsea installations, and the overall integration of FO surveillance into traditional workflows. It will take some time before all these issues are addressed but we believe that FO based applications will play a key role in future well and reservoir surveillance. 
In this paper we present a recent example of single-phase flow profiling using DAS. The example is from a long horizontal, smart polymer injector operated by Petroleum Development Oman (PDO).|","Well and reservoir surveillance, flow monitoring, Distributed Acoustic Sensing, fiber optic sensing"

Multi-phase pumps (MSPs) have been successfully used to accelerate production from wellheads and reduce well intervention costs. As multi-phase pumps are essentially hybrids of a pump and a compressor they face challenges from variations in GVF, changing flow conditions and from the gas-compression effect. MSPs can also be complex, have large capex/opex and consume a lot of power. Surface jet pumps, innovatively combined with novel compact separation, provide a cost effective and simpler method for multi-phase pumping. Surface jet pumps (SJPs) are simple, low cost, passive devices that use a high pressure (HP) fluid as the motive force to boost the pressure of the LP well and deliver it for processing. The LP multi-phase flow is separated by a compact separator and the separated liquid pumped by a single phase pump while the gas is boosted by the surface jet pump. The power required to drive the single phase pump is a fraction of the power consumed by the multiphase pump. The high pressure fluid that is needed for the motive flow for the SJP can come from a HP well, the discharge of a compressor or from the export gas line. Advantages of using SJPs with compact separators include no moving parts, zero maintenance, zero power or fuel gas usage, small footprint and varying layout configurations. SJPs are well suited to changes in process conditions, liquid ingestion and variations in GVF (without affecting performance). This paper discusses the use of Surface Jet Pumps and compact separators as an alternative to multi-phase pumps and cites several case studies of where this technology has been utilised. The design and operational criteria of SJPs, as well as the economics are also highlighted.  Introduction 
As oil and gas fields reach maturity, production becomes restricted for a variety of reasons such as increased water-cut and deterioration of the inflow characteristics of wells. If nothing is done, the low pressure wells will be loaded with liquids and seize production prematurely. 
Multiphase pumps have been used successfully to boost production from low pressure oil wells. One of their benefits is that they can handle multiphase flow, a mixture of gas and liquids without the need to separate the two phases. Multiphase pumps however consume big power as they need to boost the pressure of both gas and liquids. There is however an alternative solution in cases where a high pressure source is available. 
This paper describes the use of surface jet pumps (SJPs) to revive oil and gas wells and prolong their production life. The challenge related to both oil and gas production is handling multiphase flow, a mixture of gas-oil and water by the boosting system. SJPs are capable of handling multiphase flow similar to multiphase pumps, but selection of the SJP system depends on the available source of HP motive flow. 
The use of surface jet pumps (SJPs) is one of the simplest and most cost effective ways to revive low pressure oil and gas wells, or boost production from such wells. A high pressure (HP) fluid is needed as the motive flow and the source of energy for the SJP. The paper describes the various solutions using the SJP system and provides some guidelines for selecting the best candidate LP wells. The paper also refers to several recent field examples. 
The economics of using the SJP system is very attractive and all field applications to date have shown the recovery of capital from the added revenue ranging from only ten days to a few months.|","Surface jet pump, Multi-Phase Pumping, Compressor"

The natural depletion of reservoirs with increased water-cut and aging facilities has forced the oil and gas industry to improve methods and technologies for the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery. A compact patented in-line cyclonic separator, called the Wx, has been developed as a solution. The unit is a single passive device used to separate bulk-water from a water continuous (oil-water) mixture. It is capable of recovering up to 60% of inlet total water production at a quality of 1000 ppm or less. Wx technology has been extensively tested in the UK and has also been successfully deployed onshore and offshore in Norway. 
This paper discusses how Wx oil/water compact separator can be used with existing technologies to address the issues of ‘High Water cuts’, in order to recover maximum hydrocarbons.

This study systematically investigates the mechanical instability of a wellbore as a function of rock mechanical properties and in-situ earth stresses, and validates the predicted failures with post-drilling problematic wells. Results from this study will help to avoid wellbore instability related issues. 
Extended Reach Wells (ERD) were drilled in field X through shale formations inter-bedded by unconsolidated sandstone formations and carbonate formations which experienced severe wellbore instabilities. 
Rock mechanics lab tests were performed on preserved core samples and all the available well logs were obtained and subsequently analyzed thoroughly to develop the rock mechanics properties profile. 
Daily drilling reports were analyzed and this drilling history was used to evaluate the best failure criterion for modeling purposes. Accordingly, Mogi-coulomb was found to be the most appropriate failure criterion that matches the drilling history failures with predicted failures and can be used for more accurate future wellbore problem predictions. 
An industrial geomechanical software was used to build a Mechanical Earth Model (MEM). The software output was calibrated and validated with the observed failed wellbore condition in selected drilled wells. 
Subsequently, the root causes of different wellbore instability problems were identified. After preliminary validation of the MEM, the safe mud weight window for drilling future wells was predicted with respect to each formation by providing plots for different inclinations and azimuths. 
The safe mud weight windows for drilling in any inclination, azimuth and measured depth for Aruma, Rumaila, Ahmadi, Safaniya, Biyadh and Buwaib were found and reported. Furthermore, the safest mud weight window that works for the entire section at any inclination, azimuth and measured depth was discovered and reported for the fisrt time.

Through years of research and development, ProSep has brought to market a family of mixers for use in practically every application where separation of phases or constituents take place. In produced water applications, ProSep has incorporated a series of modulating mixers along with another proprietary process technology, the CTour Process, to provide a compact solution for new build as well as retrofit / debottlenecking applications. The CTour Process is the injection of natural gas condensates into the produced water treatment line for an in-situ extraction of residual OIW. The ProSep series of modulating mixers, along with our series of chemical injection mixers, provide the efficient mixing needed to achieve low sheer, homogenous fluid mixing of the condensate to aid to the extraction of PAH molecules and dissolved BTEX components as well as dispersed hydrocarbons. The modulating feature of the mixer allows for a maintained and consistent low differential pressure under varying flow rate conditions. 
This same mixer technology can also be applied on the crude oil treating pipeline using our ProMix – for chemical injection of de-emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, and scale inhibitors – and ProSalt – wash water injection mixer – products. Both mixing systems allow for cost savings with regard to chemical and wash water usage and injection. Additionally, the homogenous mixes created allow for more efficient downstream process equipment, such as dehydrators and desalters, with less oil reporting to the brine water effluent, therefore reducing the burden on other separating technologies in the process. These unique designs offer efficient mixing over high turndown due to their ability to modulate, require less pressure differential for operation, provide a more homogenous mixture over a shorter distance, and provide a narrower droplet distribution curve.|","Produced water, Separation, Environmental benefits, Water treatment, Opex reduction"

In Oil and Gas industry, offshore platforms are very common in most of the regions. But, despite the fact that there may be risk of liquefaction, it is also seen that some projects demand the requirement of construction of offshore artificial islands to set up all the required facilities of the Oil and Gas plant. Therefore, in this study, a live project having offshore artificial island, about 84km offshore, has been taken and an attempt has been made to assess compaction levels achieved for offshore artificial islands. Subsequently, liquefaction potential has been evaluated based on both SPT, N and CPT data. Eventually, studied the reliability of the data for the liquefaction assessment. 
The findings from this study revealed that: 1) Stringent compaction acceptance criteria shall be de-veloped based on the predefined factor of safety against liquefaction and make sure that the compaction works are in compliance to the criteria; 2) Liquefaction analysis based on the CPT data is reliable as the CPT data gives continuous profiles and represents the actual site conditions, compare to that from the SPT.

However, these methods provide us with a Poisson's ratio that is representative of only near-wellbore regions. In this paper, a technique is proposed by extending currently used pressure-transient-testing concepts to include reservoir stresses. More specifically, the interference well test is generalized to find not only conventional flow parameters such as reservoir transmissivity and storage capacity, but also the average in-situ Poisson's ratio. This is accomplished with the generalized diffusivity equation, which takes into account flow-induced stress changes. |First, a generalized diffusivity equation is formulated by considering a deformable porous medium. The main goal of the generalized diffusivity equation is to extend current well-testing methods to include both fluid-flow and rock-mechanics aspects, and to present a way to determine the rock-mechanics-related property, Poisson's ratio, from the interference-well test. The line-source solution to the diffusivity equation is used to modify the current interference well-test technique. A synthetic example is presented to show the main steps of the proposed transient well-testing analysis technique. In addition, application of the proposed method is illustrated with interference-well-test field data. With a Monte Carlo simulation, effects of uncertainty in the input data on the prediction of Poisson's ratio are investigated, as well. In addition, a coupled fluid-flow/geomechanical simulation is performed to show the validity of the proposed formulation and corresponding improvement over the current analytical approach. |One can put in practice an average in-situ value in different applications requiring accurate value of Poisson's ratio on the reservoir scale. Some examples of these include in-situ-stress-field determination, stress distribution and rock-mass deformation, and the next generation of coupled fluid-flow/geomechanical simulators. By use of Poisson's ratio that could capture flow-induced stress changes, we would be able to find the stress distribution caused by production/injection within the reservoir more precisely as well.|","Diffusivity Equation , Interference Transient Well Test, Poisson’s Ratio, Geomechanics"

The conventional aspects include the presence of separate reservoir intervals (Scallion, Middle Bakken, Sanish and Three Forks) and source-rock intervals (Lower Bakken and Upper Bakken shales) along with more problematic intervals (Basal Bakken). This is in direct contrast to most unconventional shale plays, in which a single lithologic or stratigraphic interval comprises both the source rock and the reservoir. The unconventional aspects of the BPS include very low permeability conventional reservoir sections and combined shale-rich source and reservoir intervals. Additional complexity results from stacked depositional environments with significant variations in lithofacies, mineralogy, total organic carbon (TOC), and rock textures ranging from highly bioturbated to finely laminated. |Based on these complexities, a series of research wells were drilled, cored over the entire BPS, and logged extensively using advanced logging devices.

Quality control plots, such as shear slowness images, dispersion crossover plots, and combined analysis with calliper and microimages, are suggested to aid the nonspecialist in determining whether the anisotropy results are viable. |Intrinsic, induced, and geometric anisotropy are discussed in detail, along with consideration of the depth of sensitivity of acoustic measurements. A case study is presented to illustrate the art of untangling overlapping acoustic anisotropy responses.|","Document Type

The objective of this study is to provide a detailed physics-based explanation of production behavior of shales through the construction of a fully implicit finite difference numerical model that includes five storage mechanisms as well as the gas dissolved in solid kerogen. Shale gas reservoirs are characterized by multiple porosities such as inorganic matrix porosity, organic matrix porosity, microfracture and slot porosity, hydraulic fracture porosity created during the stimulation of the shale reservoir, and adsorbed porosity. In addition to this complex system, natural gas is trapped and stored in shales as free, adsorbed and dissolved gas. 
Simulation of shale gas reservoirs is conducted by the introduction of a quintuple porosity approach in which the aforementioned storage mechanisms, the dominant nano-scale structure of shales and the presence of viscous flow, slip flow and Knudsen diffusion are honored in order to rigorously represent the physics associated with gas flow in these types of reservoirs. 
Simulated results are presented as cross-plots of P/Z vs. Gp, which are used to show the effects of the quintuple storage formulation on the behavior of shale gas reservoirs. The gas contributions due to free gas, adsorbed gas and dissolved gas are highlighted as part of the numerical modeling results. The numerical model is also compared against real data from Devonian gas shales. The characteristic signature of actual data is reproduced by the numerical simulator developed in this work. 
This paper presents a comprehensive methodology, which efficiently handles all the storage mechanisms present in shale gas reservoirs in such a way that better estimates of original gas in place (OGIP) and recoveries can be performed. This work also helps to reduce the uncertainty related to shale gas production forecasts since the current available simulators do not efficiently represent the physics of these unconventional reservoirs. Therefore, it is crucial to consider all the factors addressed in this paper. Ignoring one of these elements will lead to underestimation of gas production from shale gas reservoirs. 
It is concluded that the simulation approach proposed in this study provides a more accurate reservoir model for shale gas representation and a better understanding of the flow mechanisms occurring in these reservoirs.|","Adsorbed Porosity, Fully Implicit Simulation, P/Z vs Gp plots, Diffusion from solid kerogen, Quintuple Porosity"

These studies were elementary level and focused on identifying a dominant mechanism of production. They did not consider, however, the interaction of the fractures with the shale matrices in detail. In the near wellbore environment the fracture is the crucial component of transport, whereas the matrix is the place for storage. In this paper, using a new in-house reservoir flow simulator, we introduce the nature of this interaction and show that the transport in the tight matrix can be induced by carefully designing the well completions and by operating under the optimum production conditions. |The simulator accounts for a hydraulic fracture coupled to shale matrix with an anistropic apparent permeability field, which is stress-sensitive and includes the effects of molecular transport phenomena. The fracture has a dynamic conductivity with a simple nonlinear deformation rule reflecting proppant embedment effect on the conductivity. Using a sector model, we predict short-term cumulative production trends. The results indicate that design of horizontal wells with multiple fractures should take into account the geomechanical and diffusional resistances associated with the gas transport in the matrices. Further, in-series nature of the production indicates that changes in fracture conductivity beyond its threshold value has negligible effect on the production trends. Therefore, production optimization efforts should instead focus to considerations to improve the flow rates in the matrix.|","fracture permeability, shale, matrix permeability"

Daniel, Texas A&M University","|Production of hydrocarbons from low-permeability shale reservoirs has become economically feasible thanks to advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Together, these two techniques help to create a fracture network, which act as fluid conduits from the reservoir to the wellbore. The efficacy of a fracturing treatment can be determined through fracture conductivity analysis. Fracture conductivity is defined as the product of fracture permeability and fracture width, and describes both how much and how easily fluid can flow through fractures. It is therefore directly related to well performance. |The goal of this work is to explore fracture conductivity of Marcellus shale samples fractured in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The Marcellus shale, located primarily in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, New York, and Maryland, is the largest gas-bearing shale formation in North America, and its development has significant implications on regional economies, the energy infrastructure of northeast United States, and the availability of petrochemical plant feedstock. |In this work, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the propped fracture conductivity of 23 different outcropsamples from Elimsport and Allenwood, Pennyslvania. Before conductivity measurements were taken, the pedigree of samples was verified through XRD analysis, elastic rock properties were measured and compared against literature values, and fracture surface contours were mapped and measured. Fracture conductivity of both horizontally and vertically-fracture samples was determined by measuring the pressure drop of nitrogen gas through a modified API conductivity cell. |Results show that fracture conductivity varies as a function of fracture orientation only when anisotropy of the rock's mechanical properties is pronounced. It is hypothesized that the anisotropy of Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio play a significant role in fracture mechanics, and therefore in the width of hydraulically-induced fractures. Ultimately, the experiments conducted as part of this work show that fracture conductivity trends are strongly tied to both proppant concentration and the rock mechanical properties.|","fracture, Marcellus, conductivity, shale"

Assessing the specific role of fractures in a multiphase flow context while inferring their mechanical behavior as well as their interaction leads to a better understanding of production characteristics from shale and tight reservoir.    |A realistic reservoir case was considered for this study. A classical characterization methodology was used, integrating different scales, from seismic to core analysis. This characterization step, along with geomechanical considerations, such as brittleness leads to a statistical description of two fracture sets (natural and hydraulic), building a continuous DFN. This makes up our fracture model, geo-stochastically controlled. A simplified coupling method, for which two distinct mechanical laws (plastic-elastic) are applied, is used to describe the hydraulic fracturing process. Hydraulic fluid injection is simulated using an approximate fluid model (PAD + ‘Proppant’). Accounting for the pressure dependent fracture compressibility involves the inclusion of the dynamic behavior of fractures into the DDFN through the use of analytic and empirical fracture deformation models.    |The history-match of the BHP recorded during the stimulation and overall microseismic cloud, honors hydraulic fracturing characteristics such as injection rates and fluid properties, hence allowing the validation of both the characterization and geomechanical hypothesis formulated.

Since the injection-falloff fracture calibration test is generally accepted as a reliable way to obtain several key formation parameters, it is one of the essential parts of hydraulic fracturing design. While several abnormal behaviors have been described qualitatively and are frequently observed in an injection falloff fracture calibration test, the only quantitative model for before-closure behavior accounts only for normal leakoff, which seldom happens in practice. This paper describes several new analytical and semi-analytical models to simulate and quantify abnormal leakoff behaviors such as tip extension, pressure dependent leakoff (PDL), multiple apparent closures and transverse storage. 
Based on material balance, we model pressure change with time considering the fracture geometry and leakoff volume under various leakoff mechanisms. Then, we show that the appearance of the modeled mechanisms both on the standard Nolte plot and on the log-log diagnostic Bourdet derivative presentation qualitatively matches behavior seen in previously published field data examples. 
Results suggest that the early '/2-slope occasionally observed on the log-log diagnostic plot is probably fracture linear flow. When present it can mask all or part of a wellbore storage effect. Natural fractures have a significant impact on the pressure falloff behavior when they open during treatment. Depending on the properties of the natural fracture system, the pressure response can behave as pressure-dependent leakoff (PDL), transverse storage, multiple closures or even normal leakoff in some cases. In addition, if tip extension or PDL behavior are observed, propagation pressure or natural fissures opening pressure can be estimated respectively. 
The global model for the closure behavior combines the flow regime models. When shown on the loglog diagnostic plot, calibration test data reveal derivative trends that are used to estimate parameters to which each flow regime is sensitive. Sensitivity analyses with the new model show relative importance with time of the various model features. This work promotes a complete understanding of the pressure response from various leakoff physics and provides a method to quantify parameters needed for more effective hydraulic fracture design.|","Before-Closure Analysis, abnormal leakoff behaviors, pressure-dependent leakoff, tip extension, Injection Falloff Fracture Calibration Test"

Model-based production analysis using analytical or numerical models is not a new phenomenon and is considered a robust technique for analyzing and forecasting production data; however, its application to unconventional reservoir systems often proves problematic due to model non-uniqueness resulting from long-term transient flow regimes. This non-uniqueness, an unavoidable fact when analyzing inverse problems, is worsened by the uncertainty surrounding input model parameters when attempting to describe reservoir systems with a great deal of complexity (e.g. very low permeability, geomechanical effects, near-critical fluids, natural fracturing, etc.). The problem facing the engineer presents itself when different combinations of input parameters yield nearly identical history matches but very different time-rate profiles and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) values when forecasting future production for a particular well. 
A systematic framework that covers the full range of uncertainty for all relevant input parameters would clearly mitigate the ambiguity of production analysis and forecasting under uncertain conditions. In this work it is proposed that experimental design, which is a statistical technique used to describe or optimize a process by systematically analyzing the effect of the various controllable and uncontrollable factors of a system on an output (e.g. EUR), can provide such a framework. In this work, a methodology combining model-based production analysis with experimental design is used to history match and forecast fractured vertical and multi-fractured horizontal oil wells in the Vaca Muerta Shale with high-frequency time-rate-pressure data. The primary objectives of this work are to provide a comprehensive overview of the Vaca Muerta shale, outline experimental design as it relates to model-based production analysis, quantify uncertainties in model input parameters, and finally history match and forecast two wells that are producing in the Vaca Muerta Shale.|","Well Performance Analysis and Forecast, Unconventional Reservoirs, Experimental Design, Uncertainty and Non-Uniqueness"

Even though the advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well technology have unlocked considerable reserves of hydrocarbon contained in shale formations, quantification of the key petrophysical properties in shale reservoirs still remain challenging. The unconventional formations such as shales typically have permeability values in nano-Darcy range. It is not practical to measure the permeability of the shale samples by conventional steady state techniques because of very low flow rates and length of time required to reach the steady state condition. Therefore, unsteady state methods such as GRI and pressure pulse decay which have been extensively used to estimate permeability of the shale samples. However, the measured permeability values for similar samples by these techniques can differ by 3 orders of magnitudes. This large margin of uncertainty and non-uniqueness of the results can be attributed to the interpretations of the data obtained from transient techniques and reproducibility problems. Furthermore, the unsteady-state measurements are not performed under the reservoir effective in-situ stress and temperature which introduces more limitations. 
This paper describes the design, construction, and application of a laboratory set up and test protocols for accurate and repeatable measurements of the rich organic shale porosity, permeability and sorption characteristics under reservoir stress conditions. The near steady-state measurements can be performed in minutes up to hours, depending on the characteristics of the sample. This allows the permeability measurements to be performed as many time as need to produce repeatable results. Furthermore, the absolute permeability of the sample can be calculated by applying the gas slippage (Klinkenberg) and/or gas double-slippage corrections. The monitoring of the flow rate during the experiment allows to determine when the sample is fully saturated (adsorbed or desorbed). Therefore, there is no need for gas sorption correction. 
The paper also present the results of measurements on several Marcellus shale sample which clearly indicate that shale's porosity and permeability to a larger extent, are sensitive to stress and the stress impact on permeability is non-reversible. This could be attributed to flow of gas through micro-fractures, which do not contribute to porosity significantly. In addition, the analysis of the measurement results indicated that only gas double-slippage corrections can provide reliable values for the absolute permeability of the sample. The sorption characteristics, although not the primary objective of the measurements with laboratory setup, are compatible with published values.|","Shale, Permeability"

Wellbore strengthening (WBS) offers enabling technology for wells that are drilled in geological environments with a narrow drilling margin. Through its deployment, costly lost circulation events may be avoided, casing setting depths may be extended, and, in optimum cases, deeper targets may be reached with a reduced or slimmed-down casing program. 
The elevation of the fracture gradient offered by WBS is a complex issue that involves the growth of fractures in permeable or impermeable rocks using non-Newtonian drilling fluids that are laden with solids of varying types and sizes. Several plausible (and sometimes contradictory) models have been proposed historically to explain the WBS phenomenon, and the only way to assess the correct explanation is through dedicated experimentation. In this paper, an experimental technique to study WBS under realistic conditions is introduced, and the results of a series of larger-scale fracturing experiments using this technique are presented. 
The experimental set-up described here consists of a dual flow-loop/ pressure-intensifying system to carry out high-pressure borehole fracturing tests on cylindrical rock samples while maintaining continuous circulation of the drilling fluid within the borehole. The system offers full control over pore pressure, radial confining pressure and, if desired, independent axial pressure. Several injection cycles are performed to characterize the values of the fracture initiation pressure (FIP) and fracture propagation pressure (FPP) and thereby characterize WBS effects. Typical experimental variables included: the type of base fluid (water-based, oil- or synthetic-based), the concentration, type, and particle size distribution (PSD) of lost circulation materials (LCMs) used to achieve WBS effects, and the type of rock tested (sandstone and shale, i.e. permeable and impermeable rock media). Additionally, post-fracturing techniques such as thin-section analysis were employed to study the fracture geometry and deposition structure of plugging solids on the fracture surfaces. 
The experiments clearly show that for any rock with a given set of rock strength and failure parameters, there is an optimum PSD for maximizing WBS effects. Optimum PSD appears to be of primary importance, almost irrespective of LCM type. The results furthermore show that although a minimum concentration of LCM bridging agents is required for effective WBS, FPP does not increase significantly for concentrations above a certain upper threshold value. Moreover, increasing the injection volume during WBS squeeze treatments above a threshold value may actually lead to lower FPP values. All of these findings have important implications for field application of WBS treatments. In addition, petrographic imaging of the fracture after testing show that fracture plugging occurs in the proximity of the fracture tip and not close to wellbore face, in direct support of the Fracture Propagation Resistance (FPR) model of WBS, and in disagreement with Wellbore Stress Augmentation/ Stress Cage models. 
The results not only confirm information from previous investigations, but also provide new insight into effective ways to strengthen wellbores in various formations. The experimental results are directly applicable to improve well construction and to minimize non-productive time on narrow drilling-margin wells such as (ultra-) deep-water wells by selecting the appropriate mud formulations, LCM materials and their concentrations, as well as application treatments.|","Fracture Propagation Pressure, Optimum Lost Circulation Material, Large-Scale Fracturing Experiments, Wellbore Strengthening"

Permeability and porosity are two of the key parameters for reservoir simulation. Porosity is essential for estimating original oil/gas in place and for calculating saturation and permeability. For naturally fractured reservoir (NFR) simulation, when matrix porosity is negligible, it is important to estimate proper fracture porosity and permeability in order to obtain more accurate simulation results. However, it is difficult to measure and estimate these parameters because of numerous factors, such as high heterogeneity of fluid and fracture properties, a scale difference between sampling window and real reservoir domain, and so on. 
In a previous study (Kim and Schechter 2009), a fractal discrete fracture network (FDFN) codes were developed to generate discrete fracture network distributions and to calculate fracture porosity based on outcrop map, core sample and/or image log data. Because it was almost impossible to understand reservoir conditions from limited surveying data, fractal theory was adopted to reduce scale discrepancy errors in simulations. Each generated fracture had constant aperture distribution or normal/log-normal aperture distribution. The aperture distribution characteristics could describe natural like aperture properties. The code directly calculated fracture porosity using generated FDFN geometry data. 
In this study, we developed codes to estimate the equivalent permeability distributions of large numbers of fractures using a modified Oda's algorithm. A modified Oda's algorithm reflected the heterogeneous nature of fracture networks using the full tensor permeability scheme. Because we used fractal and statistical methods to generate the fracture networks, the generated fracture geometries could have been different, even though same input data were used. Therefore, to generate reliable fracture network results with given input data, we performed FDFN codes 1000 times, using a Monte Carlo simulation. Then, generated fracture numbers and fracture density were calculated. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of generated fractures was calculated, and P10, P50 and P90 of the fracture networks were estimated. We selected the P50 case as reservoir fracture map. Simulated FDFN data of P50 map were passed to a modified Oda's algorithm, and x and y directional equivalent permeability distributions were calculated. We also developed iteratively coupled fluid flow and geomechanics codes, and simulated the fluid flow in porous media and estimated the interaction effects between two models. With calculated equivalent permeability data, two-phase fluid flow in porous media was first solved by finite difference methods (FDM), and then the calculated pore pressure data were passed to an elasto-plastic geomechanics model to calculate stress/volumetric strain of each element using finite element methods (FEM). The iteration was repeated until the convergence level was below the desired tolerance level and we estimated the interaction effects between fluid flow and geomechanics on reservoir simulation. All codes were written in Matlab.|","Aperture Distribution, Fractal Discrete Fracture Network, Iterative Coupling Simulation, Equivalent Permeability Distribution, Equivalent Continuum Scheme"

E., The University of Texas at Austin","|Reservoir depletion alters formation pressure, far-field in-situ stresses, and stresses around the wellbore. All of these factors influence collapse and fracture gradients, and therefore the drilling mud weight window. For deviated wells in depleted reservoirs, this situation is even more complicated due to the effect of well inclination and azimuth on the mud weight window. Analytical model results are presented in this paper for mud weight window calculations, considering formation pressure depletion, initial in-situ stress ratio (SHmax/Shmin), well inclination and azimuth. |In-situ stresses change due to reservoir depletion are first determined from poroelastic theory, assuming the reservoir experiences vertical deformation, but no deformation in the lateral directions. Next, far-field in-situ stresses after depletion are transformed to a deviated wellbore with arbitrary well inclination and azimuth. Then, utilizing the Mohr-Coulomb shear failure criterion and tensile strength failure criterion, collapse and fracture gradients are calculated for various ratios of initial horizontal stress, degree of depletion, wellbore inclination, and azimuth. Finally, the sensitivities of collapse and fracture gradients relative to these factors are compared and discussed. The most problematic situation is to drill highly deviated or horizontal wells in reservoirs with large depletion along the maximum horizontal stress direction. In this case, fracture gradient can reach extremely low levels, resulting in very narrow drilling window and very small margin for mud weight adjustment. Drilling along or near the direction of minimum horizontal stress is preferred. An interesting finding in this study is that fracture gradient does not always decrease for deviated wells, which is contrary to common understanding that fracture gradient always decreases as the pore pressure gradient declines.|","Reservoir Depletion, Mud Weight Window, Wellbore Stability, Deviated Well"

The challenges include presence of stable emulsions, increased water cuts, small water droplets due to high shear or pressure drops, and/or high crude viscosities. These issues can have a significant negative impact on the separation efficiency if not addressed properly. The conventional way of addressing these issues usually involves a combination of high process temperatures, high chemical dosages, large vessels and/or increased number of separation stages. Conventional solutions often demand increased energy consumption, higher material costs, larger operating costs, more weight and/or larger space requirement for the production facility. Furthermore, conventional solutions are not always practically feasible, due to restricted energy availability or space restrictions. |Early stage implementation of electrocoalescence through VIEC (Vessel Internal Electrostatic Coalescer) technology allows for a much more efficient and cost effective means of resolving the challenges in the separation train. The VIEC technology was the OTC ""Spotlight on new Technology"" award winner in 2004 and has since then been implemented in several major projects. |The VIEC technology applies high voltage electrical fields to promote droplet-droplet coalesce, thus greatly speeding up and enhancing separation efficiency. VIEC technology combines fully insulated electrodes with a low voltage feed and distribution inside the separator shell. Due to these characteristic features, the VIEC technology can tolerate any water cut and presence of gas, as opposed to conventional electrocoalescers. Consequently, the technology enables use of the powerful mechanism of electrocoalescence in any three-phase separator to speed up separation efficiency and resolve emulsion problems. |VIEC Technology will reduce the BS&W out of a given separator, increase capacity of an existing separator or enable a more compact separation solution for a given throughput of crude.

It is also a function the effectiveness of so called ""wellbore strengthening"" techniques which aim to locally increase the FG by the addition of an appropriately sized concentration of lost circulation material (LCM). Within BP, reservoirs with depleted sand drilling challenges range from just a few hundred psi of depletion (for example in deep water Angola fields with shallow reservoirs) to several thousand psi (in deeper reservoirs as in the Gulf of Mexico) and in some cases to 10,000 psi or more of depletion in certain High Pressure/High Temperature settings. |Quantifying the FG of the depleted interval and the effectiveness of wellbore strengthening techniques is key to field development planning and safe drilling operations. For a safe and successful development, several issues need to be considered. These include the variation of original (prior to depletion) FG across a field (where experience has shown that traditional 1-D models are inadequate for the complex structures drilled today), the change of FG with depletion (is the ""Stress Path"" linear and uniform across the field, or is structure and potential stress arching important?), and by how much we can increase the near-wellbore FG using wellbore strengthening techniques such as StressCage. |In this paper, we present an integrated workflow undertaken to mitigate the risks of drilling depleted sands. Field examples are used to demonstrate the utilization of multiple sources of information including drilling data, rock mechanics, and stress analysis, along with the size distribution and concentration of particulate materials in the mud to achieve an optimum solution.|","Depleted Sands, StressCage, Wellbore Strengthening, Stress Path, Geomechanics"

The Groningen Gas Field in Northern Netherlands is the largest gas field in Europe with production starting in 1963. Seismic events were first observed in 1986, but these were generally small with minimal damage. A government study concluded in early 1990’s that tremors were linked to gas production. The objective of the work described here is to utilize advanced geomechanical modeling to (i) characterize subsurface behavior related to production-induced fault reactivation, and (ii) evaluate alternate production strategies to help manage subsurface stresses to reduce fault slippage which can lead to seismicity. 
Multi-scale 3D geomechanical models were developed using a non-linear quasi-static finite element method. This modeling framework includes a global model to capture full-field phenomena and two sub-models for regions with observed seismic activity which honor conditions of the global model, but also include explicit modeling of multiple faults. This approach considers the following features: i) Irregular stratigraphy and fault surfaces, ii) Variable reservoir rock properties according to porosity changes, iii) Non-uniform pressure depletion derived from field data and reservoir simulations, iv) Relaxed deviatoric salt stresses at start of production, v) Salt creep effects during production, vi) Biot coefficient effects for reservoir rocks, and vii) Coulomb friction behavior to capture slippage along faults. Models are verified by comparing predictions for the production history period (1964 – 2012) with corresponding field data. The model predictions for production forecast period (2012 onwards) are used for relative comparison of various production scenarios. Subsidence and reservoir strains calculated from the full-field global model during production history match well with corresponding field data without the need for calibration of material properties. 
Model results show that the fault frictional dissipated energy correlates well with the radiated energy from observed seismic events, and that the energy scaling factor associated with this correlation is constant and the same for both sub-model 1 and 2. The dissipated energy during frictional sliding is a scalar quantity that provides a representative measure of fault activity for a given area of interest. Furthermore, because the dissipated energy correlates well with observed radiated energy, the models can be used for relative comparison of production scenarios to identify strategies that reduce fault loading. 
Several production forecast scenarios are analyzed and evaluated based on predicted frictional dissipated energy to assess fault slippage. These results indicate that curtailment of production alone is not an effective alternative for mitigation of energy dissipation and related seismic activity. This study shows that advanced geomechanical models are a powerful tool that can provide valuable insight into the overall trend of cumulative radiated energy, are useful in understanding seismic activity, and can be used to identify production scenarios that mitigate seismic activity.|","Modeling, Seismicity, Fault, Production, Geomechanics"

It discusses the impact of nanopore confinement on PVT properties, transport properties, rock compaction, how these phenomena affect produced GOR of LRS oil wells, and how to incorporate these phenomena into reservoir modeling studies. |The proposed methodology has been applied to construct a compositional simulation model using a hydraulic fracture reservoir model with logarithmically-spaced local grid refinement (LS-LGR grids). We incorporated the impact of nanopore confinement on phase behavior by using new correlations for modifying PVT properties in nanopores. The model was divided into three zones, hydraulic fracture, nanopores, and micro pores; each zone had different PVT, rock compaction and relative permeability properties. Production data from several LRS oil wells in the Eagle Ford shale were used for history matching and model calibration. |Our numerical model is able to simulate producing GOR behavior of LRS oil wells accurately. The ""flat"" GOR's in early stages of production are caused by delayed development of two-phase flow as a result of reduction of the bubble point pressure in nanopores. Enhancement of critical gas saturation delays mobilization of gas molecules in nanopores and could extend non-intuitive GOR behavior further when reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point. We found that the impact of permeability reduction due to compaction on ultimate oil recovery could be more than 20%. The study reveals that the period of constant produced GOR depends on the volatility of the reservoir fluid and on the pore size distribution in the reservoir. For moderate-GOR oil reservoirs, the constant GOR duration is greater than for highly volatile oil reservoirs. |Several unique phenomena in LRS oil reservoirs were explored in this study. As a result, we were able to introduce new correlations for modifying bulk PVT properties under confinement. These new correlations and the effects of nanopores can be combined with numerical models to simulate the performance of LRS oil reservoirs and to estimate EUR more accurately. |We concluded that numerical models with PVT model based on fluid bulk properties are not able to accurately simulate unconventional LRS oil reservoir fluid flow. Confinement impact on PVT and rock-fluid property of nanopores play key roles in complex production behavior of these resources.

Hydraulic fracturing in unconsolidated or poorly consolidated formations has been used as a technique for well stimulation and for sand control. Although a large number of hydraulic fracturing operations have been performed in soft formations, the exact mechanisms of failure and fracture propagation remain an unresolved issue. Conventional hydraulic fracturing models based on the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) often lead to inaccurate results because large inelastic deformations and strong fluid-solid coupling are neglected in such models. 
A fully three-dimensional hydraulic fracture growth model for soft sands is developed. Our model can simulate non-planar fracture growth in poro-elasto-plastic materials, fluid flow inside the fracture with proppant transport, and fluid leak-off from the fracture to the porous reservoir. This paper presents the formulation and implementation of a new model. The model is verified by comparisons with analytical solutions. The model predicts considerably higher net fracturing pressure due to plasticity, which is consistent with observations from the field and laboratory experiments. This is because the stress concentrations at the crack tip in a plastic material are lower than in an elastic material and the plastic yielding shields the tip from the fracturing pressure. This induces shorter and wider fractures than without plasticity. Also, fluid leak-off and the pore pressure diffusion in the reservoir are computed numerically in this model. Higher leak-off leads to a poroelastic backstress that builds up around the fracture and results in shorter fractures.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Plasticity, Leak-off, Finite Volume Method, Cohesive Zone Model"

In a generalized reservoir simulator for compositional and black oil models, the primary governing equations are mass conservation equations and volume balance equations with pressure and component masses as the primary unknowns. The phase equilibrium is honored in the calculation of partial volume derivatives. The Newton-Raphson method is widely chosen to solve this non-linear system: the equations are first linearized then solved using direct or iterative linear solvers. Direct solvers are not practical for large systems; therefore, iterative solvers are used. Iterative solvers are not exact and are usually converged to a specified criterion. The stricter the criterion, the higher the computational effort required by the linear solver. On the other hand, a loose convergence criterion can lead to more Newton iterations or false physical solutions. 
In addition to the convergence tolerances for linear solvers, certain criteria must be applied to the non-linear Newton iterations. One of the main convergence criteria is that the volume error at any gridblock is less than a small fraction of its pore volume. The linear solver tolerance should be somehow related to this non-linear tolerance, or the linear solutions should be adjusted to help the convergence of the non-linear iterations. Because of the limited accuracy of iterative linear solvers, a two-pass procedure is proposed to improve the linear solutions by redistributing linearized mass balance errors. In the first step, all the gridblocks are divided into different groups according to whether the mass change is positive or negative and by the magnitude of contribution to local fluid volume change. Then a constrained optimization problem is defined and solved to adjust the linear solutions, satisfying global mass conservation. With these modified solutions, the linearized volume errors for all the gridblocks are calculated. In the second step, a criterion similar to the aforementioned volume convergence criterion for Newton iteration is imposed on the linearized volume error for each gridblock. With reasonable linear solutions, most of the gridblocks should satisfy this criterion. For gridblocks that do not satisfy this condition, another constrained optimization problem is defined to ensure local volume balance with local mass solutions further adjusted. With this two-pass procedure, global mass conservation and local volume balance are achieved for the implicit formulation of the governing equations, with little or no degradation of the Newton convergence, and usually without needing to tighten the linear solver convergence tolerances.|","constrained optimization, reservoir simulation, mass conservation, Newton-Raphson, volume balance"

Productivity loss in some shale reservoirs is often attributed geomechanics-related factors, even when the exact mechanism(s) is undetermined. Overpressured reservoirs tend to experience a large increase in effective stress during depletion, which can contribute to a dramatic loss in fracture conductivity. Factors such as a low elastic modulus may also contribute to productivity loss through processes such as proppant embedment. The Haynesville Shale (Texas and Louisiana) is often cited as an example of geomechanics-related productivity loss since it is characterized by high overpressure (1.0 psi/ft in some areas) resulting in extremely high initial production rates followed by steep declines. 
In this study, a simplified, single-fracture coupled model with different orientations relative to the principal stresses is used to investigate the impact of drawdown management on estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). The coupled-geomechanics reservoir simulation model was constructed using a comprehensive set of logs, rock mechanics tests and fracture conductivity measurements from a shale reservoir. In particular, various drawdown schedules (bottomhole pressure vs. time) and their effect on effective stress on the fractures were compared. Subsequently, fracture conductivity (Fc) relationships considering the maximum effective stress for each drawdown scenario were constructed and used in traditional (non-coupled) reservoir simulations to forecast gas EUR. 
It was found that a managed drawdown schedule can improve EUR by up to 15%, mainly by reducing the effective stress on unpropped fracture regions. Importantly, the modelling results show that unpropped fracture ""pinch points"" near the wellbore may lead to very significant reduction in overall recovery. Model results showed that even proppant concentrations around 0.3 lb/ft2 maintained sufficient conductivity to not hamper well productivity in nanodarcy reservoirs. Traditional reservoir simulation approaches using compaction tables (pore pressure vs. Fc) lack the critical process of stress path dependency that governs the effective stress on the fractures and is necessary to adequately model this system. 
Future experimental work should be directed at measuring unpropped fracture conductivity at high stresses and longer durations (creep) as unpropped fractures appear to be a main contributor to the observed geomechanical-related productivity loss.|","Coupled-Modeling, Shale, Drawdown, Geomechanics, Fracture"

Determining optimal locations for unconventional wells in tight oil reservoirs is a complex process that has significant economic impact on reservoir management. In this case study, a rapid-deployment well placement workflow is implemented where geological, geophysical, geomechanical and petrophysical parameters were integrated using seismic and well data from a basin in China. The overall goal of the integrated workflow was making the best use of available data to reduce uncertainties and improve field development. More specifically the workflow was focused on best placement of a horizontal well trajectory to maximise reservoir exposure and optimizial orientation for fracturing to increase production. 
Integrated technology enables improved drilling efficiency, which reduces nonproductive time, better reservoir definition and management, decreases uncertainties, increases production and improves the direct and intangible interpretation of seismic data so as to interpret meaningful geological boundaries. The primary challenge was to predict an optimized seismic well trajectory amid limited a priori information. Available image logs in addition to geological, petrophysical and geophysical information are interpreted independently and then integrated into a conceptual geological model. A model-based seismic inversion algorithm was implemented to predict acoustic impedance (AI). To predict porosity from AI, a linear relationship between impedance and neutron porosity was established and applied to impedance volume. A geomechanical model was developed for the field, which provided the reservoir pressure, in-situ stresses and rock properties to predict the optimal well trajectory. An optimum mud weight program was designed to drill the well with minimum non-productive time. 
The image lithofacies method was compared with core photographs and open-hole logs. Image log analysis shows that the reservoir comprises a series of amalgamated meandering channels and crevasse splays separated by layers of fine sediments that act as local seals. Vertical lithofacies analysis indicates the reservoir channels are connected laterally and vertically. Post- stack seismic and well impedance was used to derive a best fit wavelet that results in quantitative measures of synthetic to seismic goodness-of-fit and wavelet accuracy. In conjunction with geomechanical models, integrated interpretation of predicted AI and porosity was used to optimize the drilling location. The seismic amplitude time slices generated at the top of the target show a wide zone of amplitude anomalies corresponding to the meandering channels interpreted from the image log analysis. The horizontal well was successfully drilled and encountered more than 600 m of reservoir sands. 
Seismic inversion-driven porosities were more appropriately used as a steering component to derive trends for larger-scale volumetric estimations and to identify reservoir ""sweet-spots."" Thus, seismic inversion can be a valuable tool for reservoir characterization for field development. The geomechanical model enabled the optimization of multistage transverse fracturing of the horizontal well to increase production.|","Geomechanics, Field Development, Unconventional Reservoir, Seismic Inversion, Image Logs"

The development of heavy oil (14 API) in ultradeep waters (1550 m), in a reservoir 800m bellow mud line is a technological challenge all over the word. This paper will present the solutions applied successfully to drill, gravel and test two horizontals wells under these extreme conditions. 
Atlanta field is a post-salt oil field located offshore Brazil, in the Santos Basin, 150 km south of Rio de Janeiro. The water depth has approximately 1550 m, the reservoir sits 800 meters bellow the mudline, has an unconsolidated sandstone with an average 38 % porosity with high permeability and a 14 API oil. This paper presents most of the challenges the operator had to overcome to drill, gravel and test two wells already with great success. Both wells have a casing program composed by 36?/16?/11 7/8? and an horizontal section of 800m drilled in 9<U+00BD>?. Due to the 14 API oil the artificial lift method chosen was ESP (1500 HP) installed at an inclination of 75 degrees of the well. To install the pump the well profile was built with a slant section of 100 m with maximum DLS of 1 degree/100ft to avoid fatigue during the operation, but also a maximum dogleg of 5 degree/100 ft to avoid damages to the pumps while running into the wellbore. To be able to achieve the constrains imposed by the ESP, from mud line at 1550 m to the top of the reservoir at 2330 m the well profile design had to achieve a 43 inclination during the riserless drilling section of the well, the techniques applied are described in details in the paper. The next challenge was to drill the horizontal section with a very narrow margin from collapse to fracture of the well, all the procedures regarding drilling fluids and drilling techniques are presented. The 800m horizontal section was drilled in 9<U+00BD>? to allow the use of 6 5/8? premium screens to increase production. To guarantee a minimum content of sand in the produced oil with the objective of increasing the life of the ESP the well was gravel packed. Due to a small fracture gradient of the previous shoe 11 7/8? the gravel was performed successfully with a special propant with very low weight, again the details are presented. The wells were tested with two different positions of the pump: one at the bottom of the well, and other at the sea level just above the BOP. The objectives of the test were to compare the performance of the reservoir with the pumps in two different positions, but also to study the flow assurance problems that may occur after programmed or non programmed stops of the future production system. All the results and main conclusions are presented. 
The excellent results obtained from the drilling, gravel and testing of both wells, which are presented in this paper, confirms the potential of Santos basin’s Atlanta field.|","Heavy Oil, Deepwater, Drilling, Sand Control, Well Test"

The methodology is founded on a thorough diagnostic assessment of all available data, thorough production analysis of key wells, and extension to the remaining wells using key information from the diagnostic analysis. |The methodology includes three main components: production diagnostics, model-based analysis for representative wells, and production forecasting. Production diagnostics is performed on a single well basis to identify flow regimes and performance metrics of each well, and performed on a multi-well basis to compare performance and identify characteristic behavior which can lead to well groupings and the selection of representative wells for analysis. Representative well(s) from each group are analyzed using model-based analysis incorporating non-linear behaviors associated with the production performance. A systematic analysis procedure is followed to account for the uncertainty on well/reservoir parameters affecting production behavior by utilizing an experimental design methodology. Multiple history matches are obtained accounting for uncertainties such as drainage area, permeability, etc. |Following model-based analysis, production forecasts are developed for the corresponding history matches.

Permanent downhole gauges (PDGs) can provide a continuous record of flow rate and pressure, which provides us rich information about the reservoir and makes PDG data a valuable source for reservoir analysis. In previous work, it has been shown that kernel ridge regression based machine learning is a promising tool to interpret pressure transients from a single PDG. Kernel ridge regression denoises and deconvolves the pressure signal efficiently and recovers the full reservoir behaviors. In this work, the machine learning framework was extended to two applications: multiwell testing and flow rate reconstruction. 
The multiwell testing was formulated into the machine learning algorithm using a feature-coefficient-target model. The features were nonlinear functions of flow rate histories of all the wells. For each well, the features and the pressure target of this well were used to train its coefficients, which implicitly contain the information about the reservoir model and well interactions. The reservoir model can then be revealed by predicting the pressure corresponding to a simple rate history with the trained model. The multiwell machine learning model was demonstrated to be useful in several different ways, including artificial interference testing and reservoir pressure prediction at various well locations based on flow rate data only. 
Flow rate reconstruction aims at estimating any missing flow rate history by using available pressure history. This is a very useful capability in practical applications in which individual well rates are not recorded continuously. A set of new features were developed as functions of pressure to model the flow rate. Coupled with kernel ridge regression, the developed features were tested on both synthetic and real data sets and demonstrated high prediction accuracy. The success of the rate reconstruction modeling also illustrates the flexibility of machine learning to different kinds of modeling, by adapting features and targets. 
The models for both applications maintained the advantages of the machine learning based single well pressure interpretation in terms of the accuracy of prediction, computational efficiency and tolerance to noise.

A comprehensive model for simulating gas transport in shale formation with complex fracture geometry is still lacking in the petroleum industry. First, the current models are challenging to efficiently handle the complex non-planar fractures with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length due to very complicated gridding issues, an expensive computational cost, and complexities in development of computational codes. Second, conventional gas mass balance equation needs to be revised to include all important gas transport mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption. Hence, the goal of this study was to develop a new model to fill this gap. 
We present an efficient semi-analytical model by dividing fractures into several fracture segments to represent the complex non-planar fracture geometry and present a revised mass balance equation to consider all the important gas transport mechanisms for shale gas reservoirs. We verified this model against a numerical reservoir simulator for planar fracture by considering the effects of gas desorption, non-Darcy flow, and geomechanics separately. Transient flow behavior between planar fractures and non-planar fractures with and without considering the natural fractures was compared. Furthermore, a well with actual production data from Marcellus shale was analyzed. First, we use a three-dimensional fracture propagation model to generate more-realistic non-planar fracture geometry. Then, we apply the fracture geometry into a semi-analytical model to evaluate well performance. Contributions of each mechanism to gas recovery are then examined. Based on history matching and production forecasting, the difference of cumulative gas production between the realistic non-planar fractures and ideal planar fractures is about 20% at 30 years of production. In addition, the contribution of flow mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption to gas recovery at 30 years of production compared to that without considering them is about 13%, 17%, and 22%, respectively. Totally, the contribution of all the important mechanisms is about 52%. Hence, modeling of gas production from the realistic non-planar fractures as well as modeling the important gas transport mechanisms in shale gas reservoirs is significant. 
This work, for the first time, combines a complex non-planar fracture geometry with varying fracture permeability and the important gas transport mechanisms to efficiently analyze field production data from Marcellus shale. The model can provide significant insights into understanding the impacts of gas slippage, gas diffusion, gas desorption, and non-planar fracture geometry on long-term gas recovery prediction.|",""

The Montney shale formation is very challenging to drill conventionally and has the potential for drilling into high pressure fractures which may contain sour gas. The overall objective consisted of using a lower density synthetic base mud system to optimize the ROP, thereby saving on overall drilling costs by reducing the number of drilling days and also drill the well safely due to the possibility of high pressure fractures and potentially sour gas. The main challenge was to increase ROP while still maintaining a constant bottomhole pressure to prevent any gas inflow into the wellbore. |In order to optimize drilling efficiencies and save on drilling time, advanced MPD technology was applied in combination with a low density (770 kg/m3) synthetic based mud while holding surface back pressure (SBP) in dynamic and static conditions to maintain a constant bottomhole equivalent circulating density (ECD). The system's annular pressure control mode was used to hold a desired ECD at a pre-determined position within the wellbore; In this case the heel was chosen. Constant bottomhole pressure operations were maintained throughout the entire project. The desired ECD was achieved and the well was kept at balance with the pore pressure. The advanced MPD system also provided the ability to monitor, detect and control an influx at the bit much earlier than conventional MPD and drilling systems which provided additional safety to the location. While drilling conventionally the ROP was extremely slow averaging 3.32 m/hr. The results greatly improved using advanced MPD technology with average ROP's between 7.4–10.5 m/hr. |This application also brought value to the project by reducing mud costs, increasing overall ROP as compared to conventional offset ROP data, maintaining constant bottomhole pressure with flexibility to adjust pressures as the well dictated, increasing safety through detection and control of micro influxes while drilling, reducing bits used as compared to conventional offset bit record data and minimizing any gas to surface. Achieving the goal of increasing the ROP and safely drilling the well to TD reduced the number of drilling days by at least 13 days, thereby reducing the overall AFE of the well. |This paper will include engineering analysis of the project compared to offset data along with graphs and tables.

The volume occupied by adsorbed gas is overlooked by current industry standards and numerical modeling. Also, stress dependence effect of matrix does not draw as much attention as hydraulic fractures. These two effects significantly impact Original Gas in Place (OGIP), gas flow regimes, and petro-physical properties during gas production. Therefore, development of an improved model and simulator with consideration of the volume consumed by adsorbed gas and the stress dependence effect of matrix is critical. In this paper, we develop a coupled model system for shale gas reservoir simulation. The equations considering the impact of gas adsorption/desorption upon effective porosity and permeability are derived and incorporated into the simulator. In particular, both Langmuir and BET (Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller) isotherms are incorporated using a unified formula. The stress dependence effect of matrix is included as well, which also affects effective porosity and permeability by decreasing the pore size. Subsequently, we demonstrate the numerical implementation of the mathematical model followed by the validation of our model using both experimental data and production data of shale gas fields. Finally, we discuss the dynamic changes of gas flow regimes, apparent permeability, and effective porosity during gas production using the new simulator. The results show that the model can predict the OGIP more accurately than the other models in the literature. In addition, we observe the dynamic changes of effective porosity, apparent permeability and gas flow regimes during gas production. Since gas desorption and stress dependence effect change the effective flow radius, they affect the absolute permeability directly, and further affect apparent permeability indirectly through increasing/decreasing the Knudsen number. The impacts of gas desorption and stress dependence effect on absolute permeability and Knudsen number are usually converse. Commonly, the gas flow regime belongs to slip and transition flows in shale gas reservoirs. In some cases, molecular-free regime (Knudsen diffusion) may appear.

We have identified 108 seismically resolvable faults formed over three periods. These faults control the distribution of oil and gas accumulation units. Permeability differs significantly amongst various faults, and various sections of the fault planes. There has been no effective quantitative evaluation measure on the relative opening or sealing of faults for a long time, the sealing capacity of the faults have not been evaluated so far. This has a negative impact on the evaluation of accurate reservoir compartmentalization and partitioning, and evaluation of various oil and gas flow units which are critical for constraining the development program and production performance of oil field. |There are many geological factors that influence the permeability of faults, such as burial depth, fault throw, dip angle, strike, lithology variation, pore pressure and the in-situ stress field. After evaluating these factors in the YM2 oilfield, we determined that the critical factor that controls fault permeability is the geomechanical response of faults under the current stress field. In order to determine if the faults are permeable relatively in the current stress state, we established the geomechanical model of YM2 reservoir which describes the present-day stress regime, along with the vertical and horizontal distribution of the geomechanical parameters of this reservoir. Based on the interpretation of 3D seismic data, we characterized the spatial combination relations of faults in the reservoir and extracted the occurrence information of each fault according to certain step size. Then, we calculated the normal and shear stress acting on the various fault planes in order to evaluate whether those faults are permeable relatively in the current stress state. |It is shown that the fault zone not only controls the evolution of local structure, but also significantly impacts the regional stress field, which in turn impacts the geomechanical response of fault zone and their permeability. The NW strike-slip faults in the southeastern part of the oilfield in particular are characterized by high values of normal stress and low shear-to-normal stress ratios with relative lower permeability. Producing wells in this region have low productivity and weak connectivity amongst wells. In contrast, the northwestern area that has NE strike-slip faults and NS thrust faults have low stress but high shear to normal stress ratios, and hence relatively higher permeability. The surrounding wells have higher inter-well connectivity and are more productive. In the same fault zone, as the relationship between stress and fault orientation changes, the potential mechanical behavior also affects permeability variation and well productivity. The main reason is that the interaction between faults and stress field leads to the increased reservoir heterogeneity in the fault zone or among faults. Based on this concept, we chose several advantageous well locations, where horizontal minimum principal stress is low, anisotropy of horizontal stress and shear-to-normal stress ratio are high. |This study classified the faults of YM2 oilfield based on geomechanical response, clarified permeability variation of various fault zones and their impact on productivity, and then it provided the quantitative selection basis for well placement and wellbore trajectory optimization.|","Geomechanical Response, Carbonate, Well Placement, Tarim Basin, Fault"

Altun presented a method to estimate leak-off volume by dividing the pressurized system into four sub-systems: mud compression, casing expansion, fluid leakage, and borehole expansion (Altun 2001). The volume response from each sub-system is then combined to represent the total volume pumped during a LOT. |Most existing leak-off models do not account for mechanical behavior of cement and rock formations around the wellbore. While their compressibilities are small, the cement and rock formation volume changes can be significant. In this study, a mechanical expansion model has been developed, based on a linearly elastic, concentric cylinder theory developed by Norris (Norris 2003). The model is an extension of Lame' equations for multi cocentric cylinders and assumes the horizontal stresses on the system's boundary are applied equally in all directions, i.e., the horizontal, far-field stresses around the system are isotropic. |The resulting model simulates the compound radial displacements of casing, cement, and formation along the cased hole, based on pressures inside the wellbore and in the far-field stress region. The volume generated from concentric cylinder expansion is then combined with Altun's mud compression volume and fluid leakage volume to simulate the total volume pumped during a LOT. One use of the model is the estimation of minimum horizontal far field stress. Since the model consists of concentric cylinders, the pressure on the outside boundary can approximate the minimum horizontal far field stress, which in turn and related to overburden pressure. The pressure inside the most inner cylinder is calculated from known mud weight. With an initial estimation for the far field stress and iterative methods, the minimum horizontal stress can be estimated. |The developed models were then applied to field LOT data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results show that leak-off volume along the cased hole should be analyzed as a compound expansion of casing, cement, and formation.

Most multiple transverse fracture horizontal wells in shale gas formations remain in transient bilinear or linear flow for very long periods, typically several years. Some plays show very different behavior that has been attributed to pressure dependent permeability. Often, there are reported cases of shale wells that exhibit boundary dominated flow in a very short period that implies a stimulated rock volume (SRV) much smaller than would be expected based on the hydraulic fracture treatment design. This paper offers an alternative explanation for the early boundary dominated flow related to dissolution of salt-sealed natural fractures in the shale. Three plays are the target of this study, namely, the Haynesville shale, the Marcellus shale, and the Horn River Basin. 
Flowback of water with significantly higher salinity than the injected fracture fluid may suggest that the injected low salinity fracturing fluid dissolved salts that seal an existing natural fracture system. Evidence would be seen in long-term transient rate and pressure production data as early boundary dominated flow providing the natural fracture pore volume dissolved by injected low salinity fracturing fluid that leaked off during the hydraulic fracture treatment. In this scenario, the effective permeability would represent that of the natural fracture system induced by salt dissolution, and the stimulated rock volume would be directly related to the leakoff volume. 
This study first discusses a plausible diagenetic history for generation of a salt-sealed natural fracture system in shale gas and how core, log, and conventional test data may behave. We then present a material balance model for behavior of the salt-sealed fracture porosity, the shale matrix porosity, and fracture pore volume dissolved by the leaked off fracture fluid, during the fracture treatment and subsequent early and long term production. We show the resulting permeability loss as residual water vaporizes. The significance of the model is a new rationale for a correlation between apparent stimulated rock volume and injected fluid during hydraulic fracturing.|","shale gas, salt-sealed natural fracture, load recovery, SRV, flow back water salinity"

Lack of wellbore stability generates an enlarged non-homogeneous elliptical weaker borehole. This non-cylindrical shape of the wellbore leads to complex drilling problems such as poor hole cleaning, high solids production, stuck pipe, unsuccessful wireline runs, poor cement bond representing large cost to operators. |Micro-fractured shale formation represents a challenge due to its natural lack of stability when exposed to conventional water-based mud (WBM). As a solution, oil-based mud (OBM) becomes a technical option to overcome the issues observed with conventional WBM. It tremendously reduces the chemical interaction with micro-fractured shales. However, environmental constraints of the OBM makes this option non-applicable for environmentally sensitive areas. According to recent publications, with similar complicated environments, Aluminum-Based High-Performance Water-Based mud (HPWBM) has shown good performance with features closely comparable to that of OBM. |The Peruvian Amazon has the largest Peruvian oil and gas reserves. However, it is located in an environmentally sensitive area marked by a large biodiversity and native communities. Environmental concerns related to drilling activity are very restrictive. Furthermore, most operations are performed as ""offshore on land"" (i.e., helicopter-transportable operation) where drilling fluid management cost strongly affects the final Well’s Authorization for Expenditure (AFE). Aluminum-based HPWBM has been successfully introduced recently in the Peruvian Amazon for drilling vertical and deviated wells resulting in considerable improvement in drilling performance and goal achievements.

To investigate interwell interference in shale plays, a state-of-the-art modeling workflow was applied to a synthetic case based on known Eagle Ford shale geophysics and completion/development practices. A multidisciplinary approach was successfully rationalized and implemented to capture 3D formation properties, hydraulic fracture propagation and interaction with a discrete fracture network (DFN), reservoir production/depletion, and evolution of magnitude and azimuth of in-situ stresses using a 3D finite-element model. 
The integrated workflow begins with a geocellular model constructed using 3D seismic data, publicly available stratigraphic correlations from offset vertical pilot wells, and openhole well log data. The 3D seismic data were also used to characterize the spatial variability of natural fracture intensity and orientation to build the DFN model. A recently developed complex fracture model was used to simulate the hydraulic fracture network created with typical Eagle Ford pumping schedules. The initial production/depletion of the primary well was simulated using a state-of-the-art unstructured-grid reservoir simulator and known Eagle Ford shale pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) data, relative permeability curves, and pressure-dependent fracture conductivity. The simulated 3D reservoir pressure field was then imported into a geomechanical finite-element model to determine the spatial/temporal evolution of magnitude and azimuth of the in-situ stresses. 
Importing the simulated pressure field into the geomechanical model proved to be a critical step that revealed a significant coupling between the simulated depletion caused by the primary well and the morphology of the simulated fractures within the adjacent infill well. The modeling workflow can be used to assess the effect of interwell interferences that may occur in a shale field development, such as fracture hits on adjacent wells, sudden productivity losses, and drastic pressure/rate declines. The workflow addresses the complex challenges in field-scale development of shale prospects, including infilling and refracturing programs. 
The fundamental importance of this work is the ability to model pressure depletion and associated stress properties with respect to time (time between production of the primary well and fracturing of the infill well). The complex interaction between stress reduction, stress anisotropy, and stress reorientation with the DFN will determine if newly created fractures propagate toward the parent well or deflect away. The technique should be implemented in general development strategies, including the optimization of infilling and refracturing programs, child well lateral spacing, and control of fracture propagation to minimize undesired fracture hits or other interferences.|","Fracture Hit, stress azimuth rotation, development strategies, Shale Oil Fracturing, Well Interference"

Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing together with horizontal drilling plays an important role in the economic development of unconventional reservoirs. However, according to field analysis of stimulation effectiveness, only a small percentage of perforation clusters contribute to most of the well production. One reason for this low effectiveness is that multiple fractures do not take the same amount of fluid and proppant due to fracture interaction (i.e., stress shadow effects). Unfortunately, how best to minimize the negative effects of stress shadowing is still poorly understood in the petroleum industry. In this paper, we analyzed this problem in order to promote more uniform fracture growth using our complex hydraulic fracture development model. 
We employed our fracture propagation model that couples rock deformation and fluid flow in the fracture and horizontal wellbore. Partitioning of flow rate between multiple fractures was calculated by analogizing to the electric circuit network. Fracture development is dominated by flow rate distribution, which is controlled by flow resistance within the fractures. For simultaneous multiple fracture propagation, non-uniform flow rate distribution is induced because stress shadow effects exert additional flow resistance on the interior fractures. To balance the extra resistance introduced by the effects, we investigated two adjustment approaches to promote uniform fracture development. The first approach was to adjust perforation number or diameter to increase flow resistance entering the exterior fractures. The second was to mitigate stress shadow effects through managing non-uniform fracture spacing. We found that decreasing perforation diameter or numbers of the exterior fractures can divert fluid into the interior fractures and promote even fracture growth. Stress shadow effects can be mitigated by moving the two interior fractures away from each other and toward the exterior fractures. The key mechanism is to maintain even flow resistance within each fracture and facilitate fractures to obtain the same amount of injection fluid. Furthermore, flow resistance is affected by near-wellbore fracture tortuosity, natural fractures, and stress heterogeneity in the reservoirs. These factors might also be effectively controlled by adding extra flow resistance to pass perforations, provided that this extra resistance is larger than the extra resistance introduced by the factors. 
This work analyzes the problem of uneven development of multiple fractures along the horizontal wellbore and provides new insights into how to control simultaneous multiple fracture propagation. It offers potential approaches for engineers to apply in the field to optimize hydraulic fracturing treatment design and thereby maximize well production cost-effectively.|","displacement discontinuity method, complex hydraulic fracture propagation model, limited entry technique, stress shadow, uniform development"

The effective placement of proppant in a fracture has a dominant effect on well productivity. Existing hydraulic fracture models simplify proppant transport calculations to varying degrees and are often found to over-predict propped or effective fracture lengths by 100 to 300%. A common assumption is that the average proppant velocity due to flow is equal to the average carrier fluid velocity, while the settling velocity calculation uses Stokes' law. To accurately determine the placement of proppant in a fracture, it is necessary to rigorously account for many effects not included in the above assumptions. 
In this study, the motion of particles flowing with a fluid between fracture walls has been simulated using a coupled CFD-DEM code that utilizes both particle dynamics and computational fluid dynamics calculations to rigorously account for both. These simulations determine individual particle trajectories as particle to particle and particle to wall collisions occur and include the effect of fluid flow and gravity. The results show that the proppant concentration and the ratio of proppant diameter to fracture width govern the relative velocity of proppant and fluid. Further, the dependencies of settling velocity on apparent fluid viscosity, proppant diameter and the density difference between the proppant and fluid predicted by Stokes' law were found to apply. However, additional effects have been quantified and shown to substantially alter the predictions from Stokes' law. Proppant concentration and slot flow Reynold's number were both shown to modify the settling velocity predicted by Stokes' law, as does the ratio of proppant diameter to slot width. The effect of leak-off was found to be negligible in terms of altering either the settling velocity or the relative velocity of proppant and fluid. The models developed from the direct numerical simulations have been incorporated into an existing fully 3-D hydraulic fracturing simulator. This simulator couples fracture geomechanics with fluid flow and proppant transport considerations to enable the fracture geometry and proppant distribution to be determined. Unlike all previous studies, these effects are included together and so are shown to be inter-dependent, allowing us for the first time to accurately model proppant transport. 
As noted above, proppant velocities have been accurately determined without simplifying approximations and with all relevant effects included, showing inter-dependence between the different effects. Two engineering fracture design parameters, injection rate and fluid rheology, have been varied to show the effect on proppant placement in a typical shale reservoir. This allows for an understanding of the relative importance of each and optimization of the treatment to a particular application.|","discrete element method, proppant transport, finite element method, computational fluid dynamics, hydraulic fracture"

The industry push towards compact, subsea gas-liquid separators has been pronounced in recent years. There are, however, associated risks in decreasing the size of separators. In particular, if the hydrocarbon liquid is supersaturated with gas and requires significant time to evolve, the liquid residence times inside the compact separator may be insufficient to allow the gas to completely evolve out of solution. The yet-to-evolve gas will continue in the exiting liquid stream and present itself as free gas further downstream. Excess amounts of free gas can seriously affect the reliability and performance of downstream equipment. The rate of gas evolution from flowing crude oil must be quantified to address this concern. Toward this end, an experimental program has been initiated in which the effects of pressure, temperature, fluid properties, and shear on gas evolution rate are evaluated in a 1 liter pressure vessel. The initial experiments will be conducted with air in water, with the intention of ultimately performing experiments on model and crude oils. Different agitation rates will be tested at pressures up to 200 psia. The data generated will be used to evaluate if a database of similar tests with crude oils and gas are required to properly size compact gas-liquid separators in order to decrease the likelihood of gas carry-under events.

The economic consequences of such an approach are significant: better integrity of modeling results leads to more confidence in those results, which reduces perceived risk and, in turn, can improve the economic performance of field development. 
The solution to the problem of end-to-end data provenance has six elements:  
The ability to uniquely identify objects of the shared earth problem 
An object repository that supports federation and extensibility 
The ability to associate an immutable change history with each object 
The loose coupling of metadata and actual data of an object 
Client-side caching of actual data 
A comprehensive security model for the object. |Each of these elements solves an important aspect of ensuring data integrity. Such an approach is increasingly important as model-based approaches become ubiquitous, and the available data become more voluminous, and the teams that handle the data and modeling results become larger and more diverse.|","Data integrity, Shared earth, Data provenance, Data security"

Over the last few years, the hydrocarbon production from shale plays has grown dramatically around the world. These unconventional resources have presented many challenges to the oil and gas industry. One of the biggest challenges for evaluators is to predict long-term shale production performance, especially in a timely and reliable manner. 
For traditional reservoirs, the most common practice of reserve evaluation is Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), a method with decided advantages; it is not only the simplest and least time-consuming method, but it also accommodates the historical field uncertainties by honoring observed performance trends. However, applying the traditional DCA method to shale wells, engineers commonly encounter the difficulties of simultaneously matching the high initial production rate, the extremely sharp decline rate in the transient flow period, and the shallow decline resulting from boundary-dominated flow (BDF) in late-life. This suggests that traditional DCA may not be suitable for evaluating shale reservoirs. As a result, numerical simulation seems to be the best solution to provide reliable results but at the expense of extensive manpower, cost, time, and data requirements. 
We propose an alternate DCA approach, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional DCA or numerical simulation, to estimate the recoverable hydrocarbons. We suggest that a mechanism of ""growing drainage volume"" is an excellent way to conceptualize and model the performance of shale wells. This paper presents a new extended exponential form of the production decline analytical equation. Three empirical depletion terms, <U+00DF>e, <U+00DF>l, and n, have been used in the equation. The parameter <U+00DF>e represents the early, sharp decline in the transient period immediately after the well is put on production; the <U+00DF>l parameter represents the comparatively shallow decline in late-life when the progress of ""growing drainage volume"" plays the dominant role on the production performance; the parameter n is an empirical exponent. The overall decline rate can be calculated by a relationship involving, <U+00DF>e, <U+00DF>l, n, and time t. Even though the new method is not always more accurate than peer models, it is likely as accurate, and does not require the analyst to guess when to switch to a boundary-dominated flow model nor to force a switch to exponential decline. 
We have tested and verified this new empirical DCA by both extensive field data and detailed numerical simulation results for seven wells. For each of these data sets, the comparisons between traditional DCA methods, and in some cases simulations, indicate the relative advantages of this new approach. Later, we applied this method to over 2,000 wells in the Eagle Ford shale. The analysis resulted in a relatively symmetric distribution for the empirical parameter n.|","Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), Shale Reservoirs, Extended Exponential Model"

A key benefit is the normalization of performance among wellbores with varying oil in place volumes and establishment of ""best practices"" for well completions. A secondary benefit is a method to obtain production performance estimates for various landing zone options prior to drilling the lateral. Lastly, a comparison of recovery factors for various assumptions of producing height can provide a ""reality check"" on how much of the vertical pay column is connected to the wellbore via propped or unpropped conductivity. Initial results from analysis of over 150 Wolfcamp and Cline wells indicated an average recovery factor of 8.2% for 160 acre drainage areas. The performance study suggests that the producing heights in these low modulus formations are limited primarily to the propped height with limited unpropped height. This is a significant finding in that propped height from tracer surveys is limited to 50 to 60 ft regardless of the fluid type pumped with resultant producing heights of 100–150 ft when unpropped height is considered. The unpropped height estimate was made from a correlation to recovery factors. While normally propped heights can be improved in conventional reservoirs with gelled fluids, the higher viscosity fluids are shown to be ineffective at increasing propped heights in organic nanodarcy shales due to the large disconnect between break and closure times. Recommendations are provided to determine ""best practices"" to economically increase producing height, ideally with generic completion procedures using normal hybrid slickwater/borate systems. One option proposed is the use of coiled tubing to deliver the treatment via the annulus and then clean out the subsequent bridge plug location following a traditional ""forced closure"" procedure in the lateral to close the fracture prior to excessive proppant settling. Another option being discussed is the use of lightweight proppants, however the unit cost will need to be significantly reduced to make this an economic option due to the large proppant volumes required in shales. With lightweight proppants the volumes are reduced significantly due to the difference in specific gravity, however at the high unit cost this would still increase the stage cost by a factor of three. There are several other recently released products that have the potential to improve propped height and these should be thoroughly evaluated before dismissing them given the significant upside that exists. In many shale plays the gross pay thickness is well in excess of the expected conductive height and the ability to contact more vertical section should translate into significantly better production rates that may help justify the increased investment. The study should encourage additional research to be conducted in this area.|","Performance Analysis, Recovery Factor Applications, Frac Optimzation, Liquid Rich Shales, Petrophysical Integration"

Stress profiles can be estimated using modern sonic logs in conjunction with geomechanical models but they require calibration with direct measurement of stresses from diagnostic testing, such as micro-fracture testing. |The organic-rich middle Miocene to lower Pliocene Monterey Formation is the main producing reservoir rock in the Southern California Offshore area. The most desirable reservoir rocks are the lower calcareous and massive chert zones due to the abundant presence of natural fractures which are necessary for these zones to be economically productive. The Antelope shale, the Monterey equivalent in the San Joaquin valley, may hold the same production potential. However, due to low permeability and less natural fracture density, the economic development of the Antelope shale will require stimulated completions. |This paper discusses the first case study on microfracture testing in the Antelope Shale. Results show that direct stress measurements can be successfully acquired at multiple intervals in a few hours and the vertical resolution nearly corresponds to log scale. Therefore, microfracture testing is an appropriate choice for calibrating log derived geomechanical models and obtaining a complete, accurate, and precise vertical stress profile. Further, these calibrated models helped to identify potential fracture boundaries across wellbore and evaluate fracture growth using 3D frac simulator. This resulted in optimized perforation and frac placement in multi-stage frac completion. |Microfracture tests were compared with leak off tests across adjacent wells to give more confidence in mud weight window for safe drilling. The closure stress calculated from calibrated sonic logs served as a yardstick for comparing with Leak off Test (LOT) and Formation Integrity Test (FIT) data.

It is a common practice to reduce the number of parameters that are used to fully describe a static geological model for assisted-history-matching (AHM) of geologically complex reservoirs. However, a model reconstructed from the reduced parameters may often be distorted from prior geological information, especially when discrete facies indicator presents in the model; for example, a reconstructed ""channel"" does not look like a channel. This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) method that learns prior geological information/data, and then reconstructs a model after pluri-principal-component-analysis (pluri-PCA) is applied. The main steps of the methods are: first, a dictionary of object-based channelized geological models is generated based on the prior geological data/information. A pluri-PCA approach is applied to reduce the dimensions of grid-based static model and to convert the facies models to Gaussian PCA-coefficients. Second, the PCA coefficients are tuned during history matching process and the pluri-Gaussian rock-type-rule is applied to reconstruct the complex geological facies model from the tuned coefficients. Finally, a ML technique called ""Piecewise Reconstruction from a Dictionary"" (PRaD), which is based on the Markov Random Field method, is introduced to minimize the feature distance between the reconstructed model and the training models. In order to enforce geological plausibility, the facies models are reconstructed or regenerated by putting together pieces from different patches in the training realizations. 
An AHM workflow with the above described new method has been applied to a real turbidite channelized reservoir. The prior geological model indicates that there is clear sand deposition between a gas injector and oil producers. However, one of the production wells has been observed much less gas production than simulated result. Without adding the plausiable additonal fault, the AHM results convinced that the reasonable match on gas production can only be achieved by changing channel orientation and shales/facies distribution. In addition, the new method is observed to preserve both channel features and geostatistics of the model parameters (e.g. facies, permeability, porosity). The additional uncertainties in dynamic aspects (e.g. aquifer strength, relative permeability multipliers, etc.) will be included in AHM workflow and addressed by a derivative-free optimization approach. 
The new method is able to leverage the prior information provided by geologists in order to produce a non-Gaussian geologically plausible facies model that matches the observation data. While the pluri-PCA reconstruction process helps to preserve the major features and facies fraction within the geological model description, the PRaD method recaptures the missing details of minor features and enables the final model to closely link to the training realizations. Unlike the conventional approach, e.g. adding artificial flow barrier, this method renders the whole history matching workflow applicable to practical problems. In summary, the proposed method can further enhance the quality of the model reconstructed from a training dictionary of geological models.|","Markov Random Field, Assisted History Matching, Machine Learning, Geological Facies, Principal Component Analysis"

However, this assumption does not hold for AHM problems of real assets. This paper critically investigates the impact of using realistic, inaccurate simulation models. In particular it demonstrates the risk of underestimating uncertainty, when conditioning real-life models to large numbers of field data. Even though it is well-known, that model error and under-modeling impacts Bayesian methods, the practical effect that uncertainty may be severely underestimated, simply by using all available data is not well appreciated. Besides highlighting this effect, also a mitigation strategy to counteract this problem will be proposed and shown to be effective for the analytical toy model as well as for the real field case used as tests in this paper. |After briefly reviewing the Bayesian method and its underlying assumptions, limitations of AHM approaches within the Bayesian framework are analyzed using a simple analytical model in which forecast uncertainty can be computed both with and without constraints due to historic data. In particular the model can be used to illustrate the impact of using an inaccurate, or incomplete, simulation model. The observations from this analytical work can then be generalized to real-life workflows that are currently implemented in many commercial and proprietary tools. To mitigate the observed problem, a fairly simple but effective modification of the AHM workflow is proposed and tested on the analytical test case. |The same mitigation procedure is then also applied to improve uncertainty quantification of production forecasts using a real asset model. In order to see if the proposed workflow indeed leads to a more credible uncertainty assessment for forecast results, a specific realization of the asset model is used to generate synthetic production data. The model used for history matching and uncertainty quantification uses a different geological realization and hence can never reproduce the production results (which are assumed to have negligible noise). Also in this realistic setting, it is shown that forecasts easily can be under-estimated when large numbers of data are used to constrain forecast uncertainty in an imperfect model with accurate data. This undesired effect comes out as the flip-side of the attractive property of Bayesian methods that model parameters can be inferred with increased accuracy if the number of data is increased in a perfect model with noisy data.|","model inconsistency, Uncertainty quantification, Bayesian approach, numerical error, Assisted history-matching"

The thermodynamic properties of in-situ hydrocarbon mixtures in such small pores are significantly different from those of fluids in bulk size, primarily due to effect of large capillary pressure. For example, it has been recognized that the phase envelop shifts and bubble-point pressure is suppressed in tight and shale oil reservoirs. On the other hand, the stress-dependency is pronounced in low permeability rocks. It has been observed that pore sizes, especially the sizes of pore-throats, are subject to decrease due to rock deformation induced by the fluid depletion from over-pressurized tight and shale reservoirs. This reduction on pore spaces again affects the capillary pressure and therefore thermodynamic properties of reservoir fluids. Thus it is necessary to model the effect of stress- dependent capillary pressure and rock deformation on tight and shale reservoirs. |In this paper, we propose and develop a multiphase, multidimensional compositional reservoir model to capture the effect of large capillary pressure on flow and transport in stress-sensitive unconventional reservoirs. The vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculation is performed with Peng-Robinson Equation of State (EOS), including the impact of capillary pressure on phase behavior and thermodynamic properties. The fluid flow is fully coupled with geomechanical model, which is derived from the thermo- poro-elasticity theory; mean normal stress as the stress variable is solved simultaneously with mass conservation equations. The finite-volume based numerical method, integrated finite difference method, is used for space discretization for both mass conservation and stress equations. The formulations are solved fully implicitly to assure the stability. |We use Eagle Ford tight oil formations as an example to demonstrate the effect of capillary pressure on VLE. It shows that the bubble-point pressure is suppressed within nano-pores, and fluid properties, such as oil density and viscosity, are influenced by the suppression due to more light components remained in liquid phase. In order to illustrate the effect of stress-dependent capillary pressure on tight oil flow and production, we perform numerical studies on Bakken tight oil reservoirs. The simulation results show that bubble-point suppression is exaggerated by effects of rock deformation, and capillary pressure on VLE also affects the reservoir pressure and effective stress. Therefore the interactive effects between capillary pressure and rock deformation are observed in numerical results. Finally, the production performance in the simulation examples demonstrates the large effect of large capillary pressure on estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) in stress-sensitive tight reservoirs.|","Tight Reservoir, Geomechanics, Shale Reservoir, Capillary Pressure, Stress sensitivity"

Recently, flowback chemical analysis has been considered as a complementary approach for evaluating fracturing operations and characterizing reservoir properties. Understanding the source of flowback salts and the mechanisms controlling the water chemistry is essential but also challenging due to the complexity of shale-water interactions. In this study, samples of flowback water and downhole shales are analyzed to investigate the mechanisms controlling the chemistry of flowback water. 
The water samples at different flowback times and the shale samples are collected from three wells completed in the Muskwa, Otter-Park, and Evie members of the Horn River Basin. The water samples consist of aqueous solution and precipitated salts. The water samples are digested in nitric acid to dissolve the precipitated salts, and are analyzed at both intact and acid-digested conditions using ICP-MS. The flowback salts are weighted and analyzed using XRD and SEM-EDXS. A sequential ion-extraction is performed on the shale samples; and the extracted ions are categorized into three tiers of loosely-, moderately-, and strongly-attached ions. 
The concentration of monovalent cations in both intact and acid-digested samples is higher than that of divalent cations. Also, the concentration of all cations is higher in the acid-digested samples compared with that in the intact samples. The ratio of divalent cations concentration in the acid-digested samples to that in the intact samples is higher than that for the monovalent cations. This ratio increases for the divalent cations over time, while it remains constant for the monovalent cations. Additionally, for the acid-digested samples the monovalent cations concentration has an initial sharp increase followed by a slower increase at later flowback stages; while the divalent cations concentration increases continuously over time. These results suggest that the majority of the ions in the early flowback water are loosely-attached monovalent ions. These ions can be originated from the mixing with in-situ formation brine, dissolution of soluble precipitated salts, or leaching of exchangeable cations from the clay minerals. Similarly, the role of relatively slow water-rock interactions (such as leaching of divalent exchangeable cations, e.g. Ca2+,) increases at the later flowback stages. XRD and SEM-EDXS analyzes of the flowback salts indicate that sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium carbonate are the major salts. The sequential ion-extraction reveals that the majority of the monovalent cations are in the loosely-attached tier. However, majority of the divalent cations are moderately- /strongly-attached to the rock. The strongly-attached portion of the ions is determined by acid digestion of the rock sample at the final stage of sequential extraction process. These strongly-attached ions cannot be easily released by hydraulic fracturing and therefore, has small effect on the flowback water chemistry.|","Flowback Chemical Analysis, Salt Origin, Sequential ion-extraction"

In many of these reservoirs, horizontal wells are drilled to intersect a large number of fractures, particularly in low-matrix-permeability formations. In addition, the application of horizontal wells intersecting multiple hydraulic fractures has been widespread to allow shale gas and oil reservoirs, some of which are also naturally fractured, to produce economically. |In this paper, we investigate the pressure transient behavior of horizontal wells in continuously and discretely naturally fractured reservoirs (NFR)s using semi-analytical boundary element solutions. These solutions have the advantages of the absence of grids and reduced dimensionality. Furthermore, they provide continuous rather than discrete solutions. The solutions are sufficiently general to be applied to many different well geometries and reservoir geological settings, where the spatial domain may include arbitrary fracture and/or fault distributions with different types of outer boundaries. A number of solutions have been published in the literature for horizontal wells in NFRs using the conventional dual-porosity models that are not applicable to many of these reservoirs. Most of these published solutions ignore the wellbore and the unfractured sections of the horizontal well. Therefore, they cannot capture the true early-time response, such as fracture radial flow. They may also yield incorrect damage skin values. Our solutions take these effects into account. |Our solutions can also be applied to shale gas and oil reservoirs without shale-gas transport nonlinearities when the average reservoir pressure is above the desorption pressure. Our solutions for horizontal wells in fractured reservoirs can contain any spatial distribution of finite or infinite conductivity fractures with arbitrary length and orientation. The number and type of fractures (hydraulic or natural) intersecting the wellbore and with each other are not limited in both homogeneous and naturally fractured reservoirs. We present a number of examples to show different flow regimes that a horizontal well with multiple fractures exhibits, and to show that the conventional dual-porosity models simply do not work and can be deceptive. In our solutions, continuous and discrete conductive and nonconductive fractures are treated explicitly. The exact treatment of the uniform wellbore pressure condition, and the inclusion of the wellbore and the unfractured sections of the horizontal well have led to identification of new flow regimes that were not apparent from the existing solutions. Consequently, our solutions capture the true pressure transient behavior of the system, such as fracture radial flow. In this paper, a new classification of wellbore and fracture skin damage is given, and their effects on the pressure transient behavior are investigated. |There are many factors that dominate the pressure transient behavior of horizontal wells intersected by multiple hydraulic fractures in naturally fractured reservoirs, such as fracture conductivities, lengths, and distributions, as well as whether or not fractures intersect the wellbore. Diagnostic derivatives plots are presented for a variety of horizontal wells with multiple fractures in homogenous and NFRs. It is shown that these reservoirs exhibit many different flow regimes. A multistage-fractured horizontal well in a very low-permeability shale reservoir example is also presented.

In hydraulic fracturing, it is natural to think that regions of brittle rock are prime candidates for effective fracture network creation or may be relatively easy to fracture. Consequently, various forms of brittleness indices have been introduced, in part, to decide where to place perforation clusters in multi-stage horizontal completions. These brittleness indices are often calculated using correlations between elastic parameters and mineralogical data, primarily because mineralogical information is readily obtained from wireline logs, cores, or cuttings. This presents two unresolved issues. First, while it is likely that a relationship between brittle failure and stiffness qualitatively exists, the efficacy of leveraging these indices in a quantitative manner remains uncertain. Second, there are limited examples comparing direct rock core measurements to indices calculated from mineralogical data, leaving room for ambiguity in what the magnitude of brittleness indices mean to hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation. 
This study aims to clarify the definition of brittleness by comparing laboratory-derived rock mechanical properties, mineralogical and mechanical brittleness indices. Shales evaluated include the Floyd, Haynesville, Eagle Ford, and Barnett. Rock properties measured in this study are Young's modulus, Brinell hardness, tensile strength, and compressive strength. The mineralogical content of the specimens was determined by the x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. A mineral-defined brittleness index is computed from the XRD data, while the mechanical brittleness indices are computed from tensile and compressive strength testing of core from these shale formations. Results show little agreement among the mechanically based indices, but hardness measurement trends coincide with elasticity-based mechanical indices and mineralogical indices. Additional data is needed verify the possible relationship between tensile strength and mineralogy. Strong correlation exists between mineralogical-based brittleness and Brinell hardness in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shales. The Brinell hardness index could be applied in lieu of brittleness with the added benefit of estimating proppant embedment.|","Brittleness, Hydraulic Fracturing, Rock Mechanics"

D., Stanford University","|Abstract 
During hydraulic fracture stimulation of the Middle Bakken Formation, many out-of-zone microseismic events are observed in the Mission Canyon Formation located ~ 800 ft above the Middle Bakken. These microseismic events follow an abnormal sequence, where the events are first located ~800 ft above the perforation location, followed by subsequent events moving downwards towards to the perforation location along an interpreted fault. We predict frac gradient variation in the vertical depth direction to investigate its relation to the unusual microseismicity. Using laboratory observed time-dependent behavior of rocks from the study field, we apply the viscous relaxation model to predict horizontal differential stress accumulation from geophysical logs. We further calculate two horizontal stress magnitude profiles from knowledge of the tectonic faulting constraint within the reservoir. The predicted least principal stress magnitude indicates that the Upper and Lower Bakken Formations are acting as weak frac barriers during hydraulic fracture stimulation in the Middle Bakken, while the Lodgepole and the Three Forks Formations above and below the Bakken Formation are not frac barriers. To compare the predicted stress values with the depth at which the out-of-zone seismicity occurs, we calculate the pore pressure perturbation (?P) required to cause slip along well-oriented fractures and faults as a function of depth. We find that the calculated ?P values match the microseismicity sequence: that is, the events occur first at depths that require the smallest values of pore pressure perturbation, and events of later stages are located at depths that require a much higher pressure perturbation. The stress profile calculated using a modified Eaton model does not capture the characters of the microseismicity. The calculated stress and ?P profiles indicate that the out-of-zone microseismic events are related to a combined contribution from preexisting fault and the lack of frac barrier above the Bakken Formation, while the abnormal sequence of these events are caused by variations of the stress state within the formations.|","Fracture Gradient Prediction, Viscous Relaxation Model, Out of Zone Microseismicity"

The term induced un-propped (IU) fractures refers to fractures created around the main propped fracture which are too small to accommodate any proppant. These could include natural fractures, and micro-fractures induced along bedding planes or along other planes of weakness. Based on production data, diagnostic methods and field observations it is becoming increasingly clear that induced un-propped fractures created during the hydraulic operation play a critical role in determining the success of fracture treatments. 
In this paper five independent pieces of evidence are presented to prove the existence of induced un-propped fractures in most wells under downhole conditions and to demonstrate their importance in production. These include: micro-seismic data, production history matching, tracer data, pressure communication between wells and finally calculations on the fate of the injected fracturing fluids. Examples are provided to clearly demonstrate how this information indicates the presence of IU fractures. 
Once the existence of these fractures has been demonstrated simulations are conducted to show what role these induced un-propped fractures play during fracturing and during short-term and long-term production. It is shown that shale properties and the rheology and rate of injection of fracturing fluids plays an important role in the spatial extent and width of IU fractures. In some shales these fractures play a dominant role while in others they may be less important. 
Finally recommendations are made for fracture design to account for the presence of these IU fractures. These recommendations have a large impact on important decisions such as well spacing, fracture spacing, fluid rheology, proppant loading, proppant size and other fracture design considerations. In many instances these recommendations would have been quite different had the presence of IU fractures not been recognized.|","SRV, micro-seismic, Induced Unpropped Fractures, history match, tracer"

The aim of this study is to use an integrated geomechanical tool based on analytical models to analyze different strengthening mechanisms. Non-fracture-based wellbore strengthening mechanisms (i.e., mud-cake and temperature effects) and fracture-based wellbore strengthening mechanisms (i.e., fracture propagation resistance, fracture closure stress and stress cage) are investigated using analytical parametric analyses. The parametric analyses quantify (i) impact of different wellbore strengthening mechanisms (ii) effect of uncertainty in input parameters.|","Analytical Modeling, Wellbore Stability, Wellbore Strengthening, Depleted Reservoirs"

During a hydraulic fracturing stimulation treatment, transient geomechanics forces are exerted on the formation which modify the stress landscape near the wellbore and fracture planes. In regions where the horizontal stress anisotropy is less than 25%, there is a possibility for a temporary reversal in the minimum stress direction. During this brief window, a secondary hydraulic fracture can be created in a completely different direction, thus providing direct connectivity to previously unattainable locations in the formation. 
This paper presents a computational validation of the multioriented hydraulic fracturing (MOHF) process. As traditional hydraulic fracture simulations are derived using static formation properties and steady-state assumptions of the formation behavior, a unique transient 3D computational geomechanic fracture simulator was developed to perform this study. The new model incorporates cohesive zone elements to represent the fracture plane, and captures the dynamics of the fracture initiation and propagation, as well as the transient stress modification in the formation. A realistic 3D fracture transient behavior is accounted for by the inclusion of multiple rock layers in the model, which are connected through energy absorbing frictional elements. 
The simulations provide time sensitive operational recommendations for performing the MOHF stimulation to achieve maximum production increase from the well. Time lapse stress fields show vivid windows of opportunity where new fractures can be influenced to extend in alternate directions, hence offering formation drainage not attainable using conventional stimulation approaches. Production levels of twice to five times were predicted using reliable production simulators. 
This new stimulation method enhances the state-of-the-art in hydraulic fracturing by requiring an understanding of the transient geomechanic response in the treatment area. As a time dependent method, this approach opens a new window of opportunity—both in conventional and unconventional plays—by providing connectivity to previously unattainable locations in the formation. Unfortunately, it also brings new complications. Industry standard fracture simulation technology becomes incomplete, as most models neglect the transient response of the system. Additionally, the availability of data related to the dynamic behavior of rocks is limited. The dynamic compression of the rock, slip characteristics between rock layers, and the amount of energy stored within slip planes—all recorded as a function of time—are particularly important when considering an MOHF process. Additional testing must be performed to obtain these data.|","Optimization, Geomechanics, Stress Modification, Stimulation, Complex Fracturing"

Material-balance (MB) analysis for in-place volume estimation in gas reservoirs has been in practice for decades. Nonlinear responses from geopressure reservoirs with or without aquifer influx present special interpretation challenges. One of the main challenges of in-place volume estimates involves the estimation of average-reservoir pressure with production. To that end, modern pressure sensors installed at bottomhole and/or surface largely help establish a given well's dynamic performance by way of rate-transient analysis. 
This paper explores the applicability and limitations of the standard analytical tools in volumetric, geopressure, and waterdrive systems for a diverse array of fluids, from dry gas to near-critical gas/condensate. The systematic approach presented in this paper attempts to increase accuracy in results by ensuring consistency in solutions from multiple methods used to first assess the average-reservoir pressure from production performance data, followed by in-place volume estimation. In this context, we examined analytical tools, such as the pav/z vs. cumulative gas production (Gp) plot, and cumulative reservoir voidage vs. cumulative total expansion plot. Both pot aquifer and unsteady-state Carter-Tracy aquifer models were considered to account for water influx. Besides the use of Cole and drive indices plots, two diagnostic log-log plots are introduced involving total expansivity and change in average-reservoir pressure. In addition, we sought solution objectivity by introducing a diagnostic tool in the Walsh and Yildiz-McEwen MB plots. Both MB methods involve plotting of cumulative reservoir voidage (F) vs. cumulative total expansion (Et), whereas the diagnostic tool consists of plotting F/Et vs. Et on the same graph. 
Initially, synthetic data helped us understand the overall system behavior and instilled confidence in the solutions obtained for various combinations of drive mechanisms. Statistical design of experiments prompted us to explore independent variables, such as aquifer-to-hydrocarbon PV ratio, production rate, degree of overpressure, and the aquifer source. Those learnings were validated with published and new field data encompassing an array of reservoirs with various drive mechanisms and fluid type.|","Field examples verified methods proposed, Methods handle pot and unsteady-state aquifers, Synthetic examples validated solutions, Offered modifications of existing methods, Material-balance analysis in geopressure systems"

Streamline-based history matching techniques have provided significant capabilities in integrating field-scale water-cut and tracer data into high resolution geologic models. The effectiveness of the streamline approach lies in the fact that parameter sensitivities can be computed analytically as one-dimensional integrals along streamlines and requires little additional computational overhead beyond the forward simulation. However, application of the streamline-based approach for simultaneous integration of water-cut and bottomhole pressure has been rather limited. This is partly because the convective streamlines appear to offer no particular advantage while computing parameter sensitivities for the bottomhole pressure data. This limits the utility of streamline-based history matching particularly for three-phase black-oil and compositional systems where the integration of pressure data is a requirement to accurately model reservoir depletion mechanisms. 
In this paper we first introduce a novel semi-analytic approach to compute the sensitivity of the bottomhole pressure data with respect to grid block properties. The approach takes advantage of the streamline trajectories and yields results that are comparable to sensitivities computed from adjoint methods, at a fraction of the computational cost. The bottomhole pressure sensitivities can be easily integrated with the water-cut, gas oil ratio or composition sensitivities for a joint inversion of pressure data using high resolution geologic models. An iterative least squared method (LSQR) is used to minimize a penalized objective function that includes the data misfit and appropriate ‘norm’ and ‘roughness’ penalty terms to preserve the prior model characteristics during the inversion. The proposed approach is well suited for both streamline and finite difference methods with access to streamlines, and has been generalized for application to three-phase and compositional systems by integrating water-cut, gas oil ratio, and bottomhole pressure data. We demonstrate the power and utility of our proposed method using synthetic and field examples. The synthetic examples include black-oil and compositional cases involving gas injection. The streamline-based sensitivities are compared with adjoint methods for verification purposes. We then apply the method to the Brugge benchmark case and the Norne field to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed method.|","history matching, analytical sensitivity, streamline, compositional, field scale production data integration"

However, one of the most basic forms of statistical analysis i.e. multivariate regression can be used for inference to improve the computational efficiency of more complicated models. |Multivariate regression (MVR) has been applied to a field data set to predict the rate of penetration (ROP) based on features of the data. While MVR works as a predictor, its use as an inferential technique shows more promise. Regression techniques have been combined with bootstrapping techniques to analyze residuals when data set features are plotted against ROP. Analysis of these graphs provides insight into the non-linearity in the relationships among the data. Bootstrapping the residuals also yields a good predictor. The regression model has also been subjected to the bootstrap technique separately to observe its behavior on predictions. |Using the aforementioned techniques, features with both linear and non-linear relationships with ROP can be identified.

More complicated models employ ensemble techniques which can be computationally robust and provide excellent accuracy. When ensemble techniques are used, identifying the data associated with each method can be crucial to efficiency of the technique. The data used in an ensemble technique for prediction illustrates the important role that this technique can play in reducing error as well as increasing computational efficiency.

This paper introduces a new system to optimize rate of penetration (ROP) while drilling by applying statistical learning methods for ROP prediction and providing real-time performance increases and closed-loop control. This paper establishes the viability of such a method, and then goes on to present a framework for phased development and integration into drilling rig operations. By developing such a system, the authors hope to provide a tool to the oil industry which can improve drilling efficiency, reduce non-productive time (NPT), and lower the cost of drilling. 
The statistical model at the core of this system relies on complex machine learning techniques like random forests, neural networks and ensemble techniques to build a predictive performance model of the well from both real-time data and data from previously drilled offset wells. Each rock formation type is analyzed separately, allowing the model to anticipate ROP performance changes at formation boundaries. This model can then assess the controllable drilling parameters and determine whether there is an opportunity to increase ROP by adjusting these parameters to some other value. 
The necessary real-time drilling data can be accessed on the WITS/WITSML protocol, and a framework for reading these data into our model in real-time was developed. By using parameter selection techniques, parameters which are significant in predicting ROP were identified. Consequently, an advanced statistical model was developed to process the available data into ROP predictions in real-time, and estimate changes on surface controllable parameters such that the optimum ROP could be reached. A three-phase testing and integration path was developed for taking this tool from concept to completion. The first phase is to apply the statistical model to data from wells which have already been drilled and determine the amount of time which could have been saved by optimizing ROP. Then the second phase is to integrate the system with real-time data acquisition and provide a passive indicator of the current well's optimization level with a red-yellow-green traffic light style indicator. The final stage is to implement closed-loop control, allowing the model to run in a fully automated state. Throughout this implementation, it was shown that there was substantial potential for ROP improvement by following the suggestions of this statistical model. 
This concept is innovative as it relies only on data which can be measured in real-time on the rig floor, and does not require information about rock strength, formation drillability, or other downhole properties. This paper provides the path for integrating this new statistical drilling optimization model into drilling operations, and provides a blueprint to bring this concept from simulation to the field.|","optimization, statistics, drilling, automation, real-time"

Predicting rate of penetration (ROP) has always been of fundamental interest to the drilling industry. Early predictions can assist the engineer in changing parameters to reduce non-productive time (NPT) and achieve optimum ROP. This paper illustrates methods to predict the ROP in a computationally efficient manner using only data available at the surface. These methods can then be incorporated into real time drilling operations, first through a passive diagnostic tool, and then an integrated real-time control loop. 
In this work, statistical learning techniques such as trees, bagged trees, and random forests (RF) are used to predict ROP. Trees provide easy interpretability and hence are favored over other non-linear techniques. However, accuracy is imperative in this procedure. Accuracy can be increased by using bootstrap aggregating (bagging) or Random Forests. These techniques are applied, using the statistical software computing package R and its numerous libraries. Statistical learning techniques have been applied to a data set which had nine predictors. 
Applying trees to a data set yields great visualization of the data, but the lack of accuracy and can result in substantial overfitting. This shortcoming was rectified using bagging or RF methods to substantially increase accuracy. The results were promising in all cases and acceptable for real time predictions. 
Scalability is another concern for real time operations. Computational efficiency of the methods were evaluated, and the best method was based on a combination of computational efficiency and accuracy. Potential time savings which would result from applying the model in real-time optimizations and demonstration of the power of machine learning techniques are included in this paper. Future improvements will be incorporated in real-time prediction during drilling. 
State of the art statistical learning and machine learning techniques are applied to prediction of ROP, whereas previous prediction methods have not been based on real-time drilling data. The result is a computationally efficient model which can determine the right features for prediction at each step, while also incorporating engineering judgement and maintaining integrity of the statistical principles being employed. These methods can easily be extended to other drilling parameters such as MSE or Torque and Drag.|","Statistical Learning, Rate of Penetration, Random Forests, Real Time"

As a part of KOC policy to bring recent technologies, two locations were drilled successfully using the concept of PAD.

""Cluster Drilling"" offers the opportunity to drill multiple locations from a common area ""PAD"" and this results in more compact operational area for well placement, flow line construction, less foot print area besides complimentary reasons like less rig move time, improve well monitoring during operational surveillance when the wells would be producing. 
This approach of PAD Drilling was completely new to KOC, and requires special Drilling Rigs, new HSE regulations and new approved flow line regulations to handle such wells' cluster. 
Because of short space among the producing wells, workover operations become challenging and require developing new Simultaneous Operations procedures (SIMOPS) to keep the work under safe conditions.

The Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) Technique is the most commonly used technique to inspect large diameter transmission pipelines. A typical MFL inspection system uses permanent magnets to apply an axially oriented magnetic field to the ferromagnetic pipe material. The magnetic field is perturbed by a metal-loss region (usually caused by corrosion) to produce flux leakage outside the pipe, which can be measured by field sensors. 
The magnetization system in an MFL inspection system should ideally produce a magnetic field that is strong enough to cause a measurable amount of magnetic flux to leak from the pipe material at metal-loss regions, uniform from inside to the outside surface of the wall thickness so that the measured signal is more linearly related to metal-loss depth, and consistent in magnitude along the length of a pipe so that flux leakage measurements can be compared at different locations during an inspection run. 
In general, the field strength most strongly affects detection of metal loss defects while characterization of defect geometry requires a field that is strong, uniform, and consistent. 
Improvements in the downhole hardware also provide more flexible and efficient data acquisition, reducing operating time while improving data accuracy and operational safety. In conventional magnetic flux leakage (MFL) tools, the flux leakage sensors are coils; in the ""high-resolution"" tool, the coil is replaced by multiple ""Hall Effect"" sensors. 
The HR Vertilog service uses MFL measurements to identify and quantify internal and external corrosion defects. The overlapping arrays of flux-leakage sensors and discriminator sensors offer full circumferential inspection of the tubing or casing string.

Mud loggers are the first (and sadly in some cases the only) people to look at the cuttings. To actually see what the rocks look like, feel like, occasionally even taste. Most people looking at a well will actually look at ""wriggly lines"" or at best the cuttings descriptions from the loggers or geologist, two or three lines of abbreviations ""claystone, light grey to grey, soft to firm, occasionally hard, slightly calcareous, trace fine sand"". We have all read them, many of us have written them. These descriptions are incredibly useful and valuable, they are often all we have to understand the actual rocks and geology, especially with older wells. But in a world where we now enter the description and draw the logs with a computer, this information still comes from the subjective view of the logging geologist peering through a microscope 
In recent years, several tools have been developed to analyze drill cuttings from oil and gas wells. The most commonly used tools include X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), bulk density, and pyrolysis. Although each of these tools can be used to develop a limited determination of the in-situ rock character, the combination of three of these tools (XRF, SEM/EDX, and pyrolysis) can provide a more comprehensive picture of formation properties. 
The combination of XRF analysis with the SEM/EDX analysis is the key to the cuttings workflow. The exact location within the borehole can be determined and a robust mineralogy developed that is independent of normative mineralogy (typical XRF) or operator-interpretive mineralogy (XRD). Additional outputs include relative brittleness index, bulk density, lithology, fractional and textural relationships, total organic carbon (TOC) proxy, and a new porosity index. Trace and major elemental ratios are also available for precise stratigraphic placement. The addition of cuttings pyrolysis enables hydrocarbon typing, producible hydrocarbons, TOC, and total inorganic carbon (TIC) within each sample to be established. 
Chemical Lithostratigraphy uses whole rock inorganic geochemical (elemental) data, to give information on: Extrabasinal source area dominance and origin (volcanic, metamorphics, igneous, sedimentary), Extrabasinal component weathering or diagenesis (cementation) Intrabasinal components (Palaeo-environment and insitu origin of sediments) Chemical Lithostratigraphy analysis of cuttings can be done either in the laboratory or at the rig site using technology advanced Surface Logging Services (SLS) that includes both XRF and XRD equipment, in additions to SEM and Pyrolysis. Where an appropriate protocols uses for cuttings fraction that are most depth representative 
With the growing interest in hydraulically fracturing reservoirs both in main land USA and now globally, there has been a growing need to better characterize the reservoir to maximize hydrocarbon recovery while also reducing the overall cost in the recovery of the hydrocarbon. With current fracc-ing regimes relying on a large number of stages to ensure maximum recovery, which in many cases leads to upwards of 30% of these stages being unproductive. This reduces the overall profitability of the well even with maximum hydrocarbon recovery. With the ongoing development of automated mineralogy tools, such as the RoqSCAN, there is now the ability to characterize a reservoir at the well-site in real-time and also rapidly in a laboratory. 
In this paper we will review the current development of these mobile and ruggedized instruments using a real life project for Eagleridge Energy LLC, on their Burgess lateral well. The paper will show the application of automated mineralogical analysis of cuttings samples pre-drilling in defining stratigratic zones via mineralogy/elemental data. And then explore the application of the same data to assist, and in this case lead, the decision making process during directional drilling of the lateral well. The paper will also look at the use of the technology in defining tactical fracc-ing zone based on rock properties (e.g. ductility) determined from the mineralogical, elemental and textural data. 
This paper will show that through the use of automated mineralogical instruments, companies can pro-actively steer wells by identifying mineral changes within lateral borehole, indicating a deviation from the target zone. Additionally, this type of technology can be used to reactively steer by its ability to rapidly identification subsurface changes, such as unknown (undetected) faults. Finally the paper will show that through the better characterization of this reservoir companies can reduce the risk associated with the drilling of expensive lateral wells.|","PYROLYSIS, XRD, XRF"

In this paper, production characteristics of tight oil reservoirs are summarized and analyzed, the investigated reservoirs include Cardium sandstone reservoir and Pekisko limestone reservoir. The phenomenon that gas and oil or water and oil are co-produced at an early stage of exploitation has been observed. In addition, water cut of many tight oil producers remains constant or undergoes reduction as production proceeds within first 36 months. 
Since an oil rate drops quite a lot in the first year's production of tight oil reservoirs, reservoir simulations are run to investigate an effect of different parameters on tight oil production. Randomized experiments are created with geological and engineering parameters as uncertain factors and an oil rate as the response factor. The method of analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to analyze the difference between group means and to determine statistical significance. 
Reservoir properties such as permeability, pressure, wettability, oil API, and oil saturation and engineering parameters including a fracture stage and well operations have tremendous effects on oil production. Oil recovery factor increment in tight oil reservoirs highly depends on enlarging a contact area, improving oil relative permeability, reducing oil viscosity and altering wettability. Future research and development trends in tight oil exploitation are highlighted. 
As primary recovery is quite low in tight oil reservoirs, the multistage fracturing technology is a necessity and it must be conducted based on a deep understanding of petrophysical and geomechanical properties.

This study has been focusing on planning wells, which target lower Pleistocene reservoirs below a depleted Ha'py gas field. Many Non Productive time events (NPT) have been anticipated, and the challenges of losing wells and running over budget have been considered as major risks in targeting the deeper prospects. 
Years of production from the main Pleistocene A20 reservoir has resulted in significant pressure depletion, while underlying largely-undeveloped Pleistocene reservoirs appear to be very promising they remain at or close to virgin conditions. In addition, the position of the platform at the centre of the field has made it necessary to drill highly-deviated wells to access remaining reserves at the crest of the field. 
Detailed planning and close collaboration between the PhPC (Pharaonic Petroleum Company) subsurface and drilling teams has been necessary to understand the geological and geomechanical properties of the key formations. This has helped in selecting appropriate mud rheology and mud additives in addition to ensuring good drilling practices that maximise safety and success. The combined effects of depletion and low rock strength make it effectively impossible to drill the A20 interval with the mud weights required to minimize well bore instability. As a result, stress cage additives were employed in the drilling mud in order to reduce the potential for losses due to the large overbalance against the depleted sand. Modeling prior to drilling suggested this application lay close to the technical limit of the stress cage methodology, and was beyond anything previously attempted within the Pleistocene reservoirs in the offshore Nile Delta. 
Careful execution meant we were able to successfully drill through the depleted zone, and as a result of this work, we have been able to deepen recent wells to access underlying gas resources.

Dual-viscosity fluid is a fracturing fluid that has been recently introduced to cover a wide range of fracturing applications varying, from a non-delayed to delayed fluid system for treatments in low to moderate to high temperatures, respectively.

These sandstones comprise the main reservoirs in the field. During the last 4 years, the introduction of various techniques has led to a fourfold increase in the production from these fields.

The search for new reserves is pushing drilling into deeper reservoirs where formation temperature becomes a challenge. This becomes significantly challenging with current available drilling tools where the operating temperature can closely reach and at times surpass the downhole tools’ temperature specifications. Service companies are continuously improving technology to increase the temperature limit of the downhole tools to contend with the increasing temperatures; however, the ability to simulate downhole conditions and predict downhole circulating temperatures that the tools will be exposed to continues to be a key factor to successful drilling operations in high-temperature wells. 
The current well-planning practice of designing high-temperature wells is based on static formation temperature measurement from the offset well and linear interpolation of the formation thermal gradient, which, in many cases, is too conservative, not taking into account various parameters that affect the total energy within the system that leads to the actual temperatures that the downhole tools are physically exposed to. Heat transfer occurs from the formation across the mud and downhole tools. Mud circulation carries mud with heated temperature from the bottom of the hole up to relatively cooler temperature as it approaches the surface, and back down the hole again; this will affect the actual downhole temperature that the tools are exposed to. Energy loss of torque and drag due to contact friction of drillstring with different formation and hydraulic pressure loss can also increase the borehole temperature and downhole tool temperature. A new state-of-the-art dynamic temperature model is required to more precisely predict downhole temperatures and which can be used to guide the downhole tool and services planning, along with operating parameters to be applied. This information is needed to be able to run as many downhole tools and measurements in real time to the tool temperature limit and reduce nonproductive time (NPT) due to pulling out of hole for temperature-related downhole equipment failures. 
Dynamic temperature modeling takes heat transfer from virgin formation to mud and tool collars into account, while also calculating the effect of circulation, mechanical, and hydraulic friction. The dynamic temperature model can help engineers evaluate expected temperatures for different operations, guiding them to select the appropriate downhole tools for the job. The modeling was used in planning several case study high-temperature wells, and a comparison was done between model results and actual downhole temperature measurements. 
This new modeling can change the high-temperature well planning perspective on the use of downhole tools in that a higher temperature rating (e.g., above 150°C) is not always required because downhole borehole temperature can be managed by applying the right drilling parameters and correct timing.|","HPHT, Temperature Simulation, High Temperature"

Bedding corridors are sub-horizontal tabular bodies of bedding plane weak zones formed as shear swarms, which vertically divide the entire reservoir thickness and extend laterally as their layers. Bedding corridors are genetically related to shearing along the bedding planes and they contribute to the conductive systems in few Abu Dhabi reservoirs. They can be best identified from horizontal borehole image logs, and as spikes in open-hole logs. Natural bedding corridors can be considered as indicators of the reservoir stress history, where they form extraordinary clusters of a huge number of quasi-parallel shear fractures in a transpressional regime. 
In many oil and gas reservoirs, natural bedding corridors networks help drain hydrocarbons and other fluids. The role of bedding corridors is particularly important in reservoirs having a tight matrix. In carbonate formations, for example, it is quite common to observe a permeability contrast of 1000mD or more between the rock matrix and surrounding bedding corridors. In this paper we differentiate between image-log porosity and density-neutron porosity, which is regarded as secondary porosity attributable to fractures. We also introduce here a working hypothesis about their effect on hydrofraccing being part of geomechanical assessment. 
Results indicate that the horizontal stress anisotropy (Shmin/SHmax ratio) is the key parameter to predict bedding corridors behavior under different stress regimes. Swapping stresses with depth is common in Abu Dhabi fields, where a strike-slip regime can open and dilate the shear along the bedding planes. It is recommended to opt for horizontal wells hydrofraccing to maximize the intersection of those bedding corridors compared to vertical wells. 
The significance of this approach is that once a diagnostic signature can be recognized in open-hole logs, in combination with lost circulation data, it can be used to locate bedding corridors in other vertical wells with no image logs. Geomechanically, these corridors can be used efficiently to increase production particularly in tight and unconventional reservoirs.|","Carbonate, Geomechanics assessment, Horizontal stress anisotropy, Bedding corridors, Onshore Abu Dhabi"

Manifestation of the tectonic history of Arabia in the UAE is demonstrated by both folding represented by gentle and open folds comprising most of Abu Dhabi's hydrocarbon structural traps and a brittle deformation represented by a fracture system comprising long en echelon seismic faults and several joint and vein sets. The most dominant, tens of kilometers long seismic faults in the Cretaceous rocks of Abu Dhabi are the N75W and N45W oriented faults, which have been considered so far as conjugate strike-slip faults. It is argued here whether these two seismic fault sets, which appear in many instances as conjugate sets, have been really developed coevally by a single tectonic event when the SHmax was approximately at 120°? The current understanding that these faults are strike-slip faults despite the absence of extensive horizontal displacements along them as shown on different time-slices is also discussed. Seismic attribute analysis and interpretation, outcrop analogs and fracture description from logs and FMIs reveal that this fracture system might have been developed in a more complicated manner than reported in different publications. 
It is proposed here that the N75W seismic faults have been developed first as tensile fractures shortly prior to folding when SHmax oriented approximately at 120°. The N45W seismic faults have been developed at a later stage possibly as splay faults by reactivation/ branching from the preexisting N75W when the SHmax was approximately oriented E-W. This has occurred by a continuous counterclockwise rotation of the causative SHmax stress from Cretaceous to present. A periodic strike-slip movement along deep-seated basement faults could also have developed many structural features in the sedimentary cover including several hydrocarbon fields in the Onshore of Abu Dhabi. 
The implications of the drift of the causative stress with geologic time from ~120° to E-W, NE-SW and finally to NNE-SSW include its effect in reactivating the preexisting fracture system, tilting folds, and control fluid charge and movement within Abu Dhabi petroleum system. The significance of the results is the impact on exploration, production and field development plans. In the exploration of the new plays, both leads with their fractures can be predicted once the direction of the paleo-causative stress can be defined. In production and filed development planning, predicting the fracture system would help better production with appropriate well placement.|","Regional stress rotation, Conjugate faults, Seismic attribute analysis and interpretation, Onshore Abu Dhabi, Tectonic evolution"

Vertical wells are drilled in the In Aminas field in Algeria with various types of drill bits, including polycrystalline diamond compact bits (PDC), tungsten carbide insert bits (TCI), and impregnated (impreg) drill bits. The operator tested a new 6-in impregnated bit with novel cutting structure concepts in an attempt to drill the section in one run. The bit was used on rotary BHA, and high speed motor BHA for two runs in the same section. 
Both runs did well, and the bit maintained the sharp cutting structure till the TD of the section. 
The 6-in section comprises mulitple layers of hard abrasive sandstone with unconfined compressive strength up to 35 KPSI, loose shale which is relatively soft and ends with metamorphic rock. 
The new impregnated bit uses diamond segments imbedded in blades comprising diamond-grit matrix material to create a cutting structure with variable wear along the bit face. This particular combination of diamond and matrix improved overall aggressiveness and durability in the shoulder. 
To drill efficiently, impregs are paired with high-speed motors or turbines. The new design successfully drilled on two different BHAs. The first was a rotary-packed BHA that drilled 406.8 ft (124 m) at 4.33 ft/hr (1.32 m/hr). The bit didn't show signs of wear and was used on a second BHA with a high-speed motor that drilled another 603.7 ft (184 m) at 6 ft/hr (1.8 m/hr). The impreg's overall performance was 1,010 ft (308 m) at 5.2 ft/hr (1.6 m/hr), and the bit pulled out of hole in a very good condition. 
The solution enabled the operator to drill 200% further, more than the best offsets and saving multiple bit trips, which resulted in total savings of USD 195,000. 
This article will explain the benefits of the new technology and discuss how this novel impregnated bit successfully drilled the section in one run which is the first time ever to happen.|","Impregnated, Durability, Performance, Algeria"

Among the tools for these analyses, an iteratively coupled Geomechanics and fluid flow model provides an essential and reliable prediction for field planning and development. In this work, we implemented this model in an in-house, three dimensional, compositional reservoir simulator, UTCOMP, using modified Chin’s iterative coupling method. This development integrated a stand-alone Geomechanics module based on finite element method with the reservoir simulator, an advantage of our coupling algorithm, and improved our understanding of the production through various enhanced oil recovery processes such as water and CO2 floodings previously coded in UTCOMP. Benefiting from the higher time scales of solution variations due to the Geomchanics module, we lowered the frequency of calling this computationally expensive module. Also, we reduced the order of the finite element shape functions from quadratic to linear, which majorly mitigated the high computational cost of our Geomechanics studies while we almost maintained the solution accuracy. To validate our implementation, we investigated a primary oil production case and compared the results from UTCOMP with those from two other simulators: 1) CMG software program using different coupling methods; and 2) another pre-validated in-house reservoir simulator, GPAS. Moreover, due to the lack of real field data, we validated our solutions for the enhanced oil recovery problems by comparing them with those from GPAS coupled with Geomechanics. We observed a minor discrepancy between the solutions at very early times which originates from the different structures in these two reservoir simulators, IMPEC in UTCOMP and fully implicit in GPAS.|","Finite element method, Coupled pore pressure-stress analysis, Modified Chinaˆ™s iterative coupling, Compositional reservoir simulator, Geomechanics"

Bir Rebaa Nord (BRN) and Bir Sif Fatima (BSF) fields, operated by Groupement Sonatrach-Agip (GSA, a JV between ENI and Sonatrach), are located in the Berkine basin in north-eastern Algeria. These fields are characterized by oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs with low to medium petro-physical properties. During the development phase, to counteract the effect of pressure depletion, water and gas injection was implemented for reservoir pressure maintenance. In addition, due to the increasing water cut, artificial lift systems were employed to effectively produce these fields. 
Hydraulic fracturing has been implemented in GSA since year 2000 to improve well performance, both in terms of productivity and injectivity for oil producers and water injectors respectively. The fracturing process has been improved over the years regarding operational procedures, enhanced reservoir knowledge and implementation of new technologies towards resolving the many uncovered challenges. Changes to the perforation strategy, fracturing fluids formulation, rock mechanics studies and design of proppant schedules are examples of enhancement to the fracturing practice that have been implemented in the recent years. 
One of the uncharted matters in GSA, coming out from the post-job data re-processing, was the necessity of a precise characterization of the hydraulic fractures vertical coverage. The presence of several sandstone layers with different properties brought questions if the fracture had grown into an unwanted zone or may had not properly covered the entire target formation. Moreover, fracture height is an essential parameter for frac models calibration. Its accurate determination drastically reduces the margin of error in treatment net pressure matching, helping to more precisely established fracture half-length and width, stress profile and, last but not least, achieving a calibrated model for future operations in the same area. 
This paper describes the successful implementation on two water injector wells of a novel non-radioactive detectable proppant for the first time in Algeria. The taggant material within the proppant has been located by comparing the pulsed neutron capture cased-hole logging passes registered before and after the hydraulic fracturing treatments. The detectable compound does not affect proppant properties and, in addition, its non-radioactive nature reduces the timing for materials delivery and eliminates the HSE risks linked to other tracing methods. 
The pulsed neutron measurements evaluation provided valuable information regarding fractures confinement, avoidance of contact with undesired layers and possible presence of cement channeling. Furthermore, combined with sonic logs and cores data, it helped refining the geo-mechanical model for future interventions design in the same reservoirs.|","hydraulic fracturing, production optimization, proppant, non-radioactive, Algeria Eni Sonatrach"

An operator spudded an extreme high-pressure/high-temperature (eHP/HT) well in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Egypt, in 2012. To achieve the well objectives, it was necessary to set 28-in. surface casing at 1183 m, which was the deepest casing point used for such a large casing size in the offshore Mediterranean. The depth and size of the hole required presented numerous challenges, including but not limited to managing the variable deck load, hole stability during long casing running operations, logistic challenges for fluids resulting from significant washouts, etc. 
One of the main challenges was related to achieving zonal isolation objectives for this section. These objectives were to cover the casing shoe with good quality cement and to achieve zonal isolation at the seabed and top of casing to help avoid future unexpected shallow flows to the surface. Meeting both of the objectives was paramount for resuming further operations. Typically, both of these objectives can be achieved in a single stage using lead and tail slurries. However, because of the long hole section and significant washouts (up to 300%), bringing cement up to the seabed would require pumping approximately 4,400 bbl of lead slurry and 380 bbl of tail slurry, which is equivalent to approximately 11,700 ft3 (500 MT) of dry cement, and 16 hr of cement pumping time. 
To help mitigate the risks associated with a single-stage operation, it was decided to perform the job in two different stages. The first stage was designed to isolate the casing shoe and lower sand body by performing a lead and tail primary cement job. The second stage was a liner top squeeze. This was a multistage operation using several cement types of various particle sizes. The top of the liner was successfully squeezed, and the objectives of the cementing operation were met. 
This paper describes the challenges experienced and solution for completing the cementing job, which could be valuable for designing similar offshore high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) wells.|","Mediterranean Sea, Microfine Cement, HPHT Cementing, Longest Casing, Big Bore Cementing"

A workflow was developed for effectively handling the development challenges in the Yamal oil and gas province of Western Siberia. The workflow integrates geomechanics with efficient drilling practices and leads to the implementation of an engineered drilling system (EDS). 
The workflow for development in the Yamal region encompasses phases from modeling to drilling practices, incorporating an understanding of challenges faced and lessons learned from previous drilling. The majority of Achimov operations in the Yamal region have been conducted in the Urengoy gas condensate field, which is divided into different blocks. The Achimov deposits are deep (true vertical depth is about 3,750 m), exhibit abnormally high formation pressure (over 600 atm), and contain multiphase hydrocarbons with the presence of heavy paraffins. Unstable shale formations must be drilled prior to penetrating the Achimov itself. These challenges affect drilling efficiency and interfere with the well construction schedule. The Achimov formations present two main challenges to horizontal drilling: wellbore instability leading to stuck pipe incidents in the build section or inability to run liner/casing to total depth and loss circulation, potentially compromising well delivery and project objectives. Thus, previous drilling has shown that developing and producing from these enigmatic resources requires more than just horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing. 
Companies are aggressively pursuing Achimov deposits, hoping to extract additional gas and gas condensate volumes from the declining fields and to implement a strategy to raise natural gas production. Successful operations require an integrated approach, using multiple data sources, to determine the key parameters needed to understand the Achimov formations and extract the hydrocarbons. Among the successes, an operator company for Urengoy field demonstrated how developing a mechanical earth model (MEM) of the reservoir and continually improving processes paid big dividends. 
By implementing the EDS approach, unique results have been achieved in drilling and completion of Achimov horizontal wells. Outstanding drilling performance in Achimov horizontal wells has led to a revision of the field development plan.|","Achimov, Drilling system, wellbore instability, Geomechanics, High pressure"

The SRV is characterized by the inner region. Both inner and outer regions were assumed as dual porosity medium. Then, the solution of multistage fractured horizontal well performance analysis model is obtained by the point source function method and the source function superposition principle.

Building a stochastic structural 3D geocellular model for a reservoir in a new field is a challenge because of insufficient well data. Structural heterogeneity due to folding, faulting and/or associated erosional unconformities may not be completely captured by low resolution seismic and limited well data. This could lead to significant structural uncertainty. Hence, quantification of uncertainty capturing structural heterogeneity requires a comprehensive methodology incorporating seismic interpretation, well data and tectonic information. Experimental discrepancies between predicted and measured depths of horizons in newly drilled wells reveal strong drift, which require a nonstationary model. The physical way to create such nonstationary model is by using numerical paleo-geomechanical deformation algorithms to reconstruct the folding phenomena (e.g., finite elements). Such proposition requires a thorough understanding of rock parameters, and boundary conditions. Another plausible alternative is to use nonstationary geostatistics, because it does not require boundary conditions, or rock deformation parameters. Nevertheless, representing finite differences of order-k, which are required for geostatistical modeling, may be unachievable with insufficient well data. After revisiting the theoretical aspects of the problem, this paper shows a fast approach to quantify the structural uncertainty range for the depth of horizons accounting for spatial drift. The approach is illustrated with an example for a real clastic reservoir.|","Structural heterogeneity, Uncertainty assessment, Estimation of hydrocarbon volumes, Nonstationary modeling, Folded structures"

Formation drillability is one of the most important aspects for planning and designing a new oil/gas well since the factors affecting the drilling performance have complex relationships between formation properties, drill bit design and operational parameters. In view of high operating cost of drilling rigs, if Rate of Penetration (ROP) can be enhanced, it will reduce open-hole formation exposure time and complications associated with it resulting in significant savings in drilling time and cost can be realized 
Normally bit engineers utilize the assumed lithology from mud logs, detailed depth wise lithology of offset wells. The lithology can also be interpreted from conventional logging data such as Sonic, Gamma and Density. Furthermore, the rock's compressive strength is calculated using Compressional / Shear travel time (Sonic log), Bulk density (Density log) and Shale content (Gamma log). 
These utilized tools to detect the lithology and rock mechanical properties have an extent of uncertainty due to effects either related to borehole or drilling fluids that require extensive corrections. That degree of uncertainty subsequently can affect the drill bit design criteria, selection and viability of performance-enhancing features.

A combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and azimuthal acoustic tools was recently run in a logging-while-drilling (LWD) tool combination. This tool combination was used for the first time in Kuwait as a part of the bottomhole assembly (BHA), in addition to conventional tools, to acquire porosity without using radioactive sources. 
A deviated 8.5-in. borehole section of a well was planned through sand-shale sequences with a borehole inclination ranging from 0 to 90°. This geological section is typically crucial from a borehole stability point of view. Borehole deterioration and significant variations in pore pressure can create a high risk of becoming stuck-in-hole. The use of conventional porosity tools in a LWD BHA with installed radioactive sources would significantly elevate the risks to an environmental-hazard level. And, even retrievable based sources become problematic for successful extraction in high angle wells. 
LWD NMR and azimuthal acoustic tools, free of radioactive sources, were run for the first time in a LWD tool combination, with the primary objective to measure porosity, pressure prediction, and possible anisotropy using a centralized four-axis acoustic caliper. 
Previous experiences in the same geological setting encountered borehole enlargements by approximately 5 in. after only 15 to 16 hours. LWD helped bypass this issue and acquire high-quality data before borehole enlargement occurred. Additionally, indications of the presence of possible rock anisotropy were observed. The results were then correlated and matched to offset well data as well as with existing field geomechanics knowledge.

Waterflooding has been an effective method for improving oil recovery process of Low-Permeability Reservoirs. Tight Low-Permeability reservoirs are characterized by natural fractures, hydraulic fractures, and induced fractures by water injection. These fractures may have a significant impact on process performance and ultimate recovery. The interaction between pre-existing natural fractures and the propagating fractures are critical factors affecting the complex fracture network. It is a great challenge to model accurately fluid flow due to the multi-scale nature of the problems and the strong coupling that exists between flow and mechanical behaviors. 
In this paper, a dynamic discrete Fracture modeling approach was developed and implemented which enabled integrated simulation of fracture network propagation, interactions between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing natural fractures, fracture fluid leak off and fluid flow in reservoir. We apply the Discrete Fracture Modeling (DFM) approach to represent large-scale fractures individually and explicitly. The model allows inclusion of the impact of stress regime on fluid flow in a discrete fracture network. This entails highly constrained unstructured gridding and construction of a connection (transmissibility) list of all neighboring cells. A methodology for modeling fracture propagation in length- and height-direction is presented with respect to poro- and thermo-elastic stresses acting on the fracture. The method was solved using the discrete fracture control volume method. Results were obtained in terms of saturation and pressure distribution for various fractured porous media. Comparisons for simulation results and well production performance show an excellent match. The new model allows us to better understand the multi-scale and multi-physics flow behavior caused by complex fracture system. 
Sensitivity studies by varying the production rate, pressure and fracture parameters could be conducted to provide guidance on optimizing production designs. The simulation results show that reservoir dynamic fractures play an important role in both direction and speed of water displacement fronts through tight low-permeability reservoirs. The oil recovery rate significantly depends on the fractures orientation and the rate of fracture growth. 
The proposed simulation method provides a useful tool for modeling the effect of fractures on waterflooding performance and can be used to optimize injection pressures and rates, water quality as well as well patterns for maximizing oil recovery.|","simulation, fracture propagation, multi-scale, dynamic discrete fracture model"

The Jurassic carbonate reservoirs in Minagish Field of West Kuwait have undergone significant pressure depletion (up to 4,000 – 5,000 psi) over the last two decades. However, during the last few years at least two wells showed sudden and significant reservoir pressure increase despite no injection in the reservoir for pressure support. The asset team plans to develop these reservoirs with more horizontal wells in order to increase the reservoir contact and thereby productivity and reservoir recovery. However, drilling and deepening the infill development wells in this area is becoming increasingly challenging due to uneven differential depletion across the field. Unprecedented drilling complications including mud-loss, well kicks, and differential sticking are observed. 
This paper discusses how a field scale 3D reservoir geomechanical model integrating all available data was built and used to evaluate the impact of production induced stress changes on reservoir behaviour. Furthermore it details how geomechanical characterization provided inputs for the field development planning. The dynamic 3D reservoir geomechanical modelling of this field integrated: the structural geological model, well based 1D geomechanical models, rock mechanical test results from core, production data, reservoir simulation model as well as selected petrophysical and geophysical data. This model was initially built at original reservoir pressure. After proper assignment of both stratigraphically verified mechanical properties and boundary conditions of far field stresses, the finite element stress simulator was utilized to establish a representative initial stress state within the reservoir and its surrounding formations. The history matched and future predicted reservoir pressures at various time steps were coupled to the finite element mechanical simulator to map the changed stresses and strains over the reservoir interval. 
The finite element analysis helped to investigate the associated changes of the in-situ stress field, pore pressure and rock properties across the field and specifically around the planned wells in order to capture the 3D effect of reservoir depletion such as arching effects. This analysis improved the field development planning by integrating wellbore stability risk assessment, fault slippage and other related aspects. The 3D Geomechanical model also distributed the shear-to-normal stress ratios over the interpreted faults/fractures and explained the dynamic behaviour of certain faults due to depletion. Field scale distribution of in-situ stress changes provided inputs to risk assessment due to further depletion. Understanding the stress induced response of reservoir due to depletion helped to plan new infill wells in due consideration of geomechanical risks and production efficiency. 
The 3D Geomechanical modelling approach demonstrated that it is technically feasible to incorporate the complexity of 3D geological structure of a reservoir, fault network and other variables within the in-situ stress field. Using appropriate modelling simulations with realistic in-situ conditions, it was possible to explain the behaviour of pressure in wells, faults and also wellbore stability risks.|","Carbonate, Geomechanics, finite element modling, fault slip, wellbore stability"

Tight gas reservoir development has long been affected by 1) complex flow profiles and 2) the impact of very low permeability on reservoir productivity. Where well tests (WT) buildup is very short, interpretation becomes difficult and results often are ambiguous. Most WT of tight, dry gas wells are of short duration; thus, such tests typically lead to multiple interpretations and open-ended conclusions. Adding to the complexity, simulation software packages often fail to adequately model flow in fracture networks. 
A series of well tests were conducted in tight sandstone, dry gas, naturally fractured reservoirs post-induced hydraulic fracturing. The tests were conducted for long durations: 100 hours in most cases, and 1,000 hours in two extended well-test cases. The WT responses from these tests were ambiguous. 
We have investigated possible direct causes of the ambiguous results, including wellbore, geology, and specific well conditions. However, because the WT response has been found repeatedly in a variety of regions around the world, it may not be related to any of these. 
After investigating in multiple manners, including the use of simulation software, we argue that the anomalies in the WT response may reflect a step in the scale-dependent properties of the fracture network.|","Shale, Fracturing, Unconventional, Tight, Fracture Network"

Real-time azimuthal acoustic measurements were introduced recently in the logging-while-drilling (LWD) industry. For the first time, this technology was used as part of the bottomhole assembly (BHA) to acquire information related to principal stress orientations in the deltaic to marine Zubair clastic sequence of onshore Kuwait. 
A deviated 8.5-in. hole section of the well was planned through sand-shale sublayers with a borehole inclination ranging from 46 to 88°. This section is characterized by time sensitive borehole deterioration and significant variations in pore pressure. These factors result in severe hole instability and ultimately stuck pipe events and require relatively high mud weights to maintain wellbore stability. LWD azimuthal acoustic technology, free from chemical sources, was used for the first time both in drilling and wipe modes to facilitate time-lapse field stress and wellbore stability analysis. 
Principal stress orientations were identified from three different sources, including borehole breakouts from azimuthal acoustic caliper, density image, and acoustic anisotropy evaluation. The results were then compared with the existing offset well data and an existing geomechanical 3D model. Variations in observed stress orientation, seismic reflection pattern, and pressure history in offset wells were used to map a fault that is responsible for bypassed oil and for the occurrence of tar and gas. The interpretation was extended to other low throw strike-slip faults; additional fault compartments were identified that could affect the pressure maintenance scheme of the field. 
This paper discusses the planning, design, and use of LWD azimuthal acoustic technology in this case history well. It also describes the viability, integrity, and reliability of the interpreted results and their use in a detailed geological interpretation in terms of stress orientation, fault trapping, and areal fluid variation. The optimization of real-time drilling operations and petrophysical data acquisition requirements are also investigated to improve future field development and overall reservoir management strategies.|","borehole stability, case history, field stress analysis, KOC, LWD"

ADCO's onshore oil field lies along an elongated highly faulted northeast-southwest anticlinal trend. The main reservoirs are part of the Lower Cretaceous Upper Thamama Group, in particular the Shuaiba and Kharaib Formations interbedded with dense limestones. The impact of faults and associated fractures on fluid flow and reservoir connectivity within the field has been previously uncertain. Flow in these reservoirs is believed to be matrix dominated, but there is some evidence that fracturing enhances fluid flow in some areas as well as vertically across dense zones. This might become more pronounced with changes in reservoir pressure. This paper describes an integrated approach in detecting occurrence and disposition of fractures, their impact on fluid flow and sensitivity to changes of in-situ stresses. 
ADCO has interpreted many faults from 3D seismic data, and has drilled a deviated cored well across a major fault in the reservoir. Core, logs, image log, petrographic analysis and pressure measurements across the fault have provided invaluable information and knowledge in understanding the relationships between fracture occurrence and rock mechanical/petrophysical properties. This is complemented with fracture characterization and structural interpretation from image logs of 32 vertical, deviated and horizontal wells. Finer scale structural information has been extracted from inspection of the cores from more than 30 wells. 
Overall, fractures are scarce, but their occurrence has given encouraging correlation with (1) reservoir rock type, (2) porosity, (3) distance to fault and (4) structural anomalies evident in seismic curvature attributes. These correlations support the extrapolation of interpretations away from the wells to identify where fractures are most likely to affect reservoir performance. Quantification of the effect of such fractures on production have been calibrated using an integrated analysis of lab test scale permeability at different confining pressures alongside CT-scans identifying small scale fracturing, and in-situ permeability measurements from well tests and production logging of well intervals with imaged fractures. 
The novel parts of the workflow are how this characterization has produced a 3D discrete fracture network model with apertures of fractures controlled by present or future in-situ stress. When this fracture model is integrated with the 3D geomechanical model, the upscaled directional fracture permeabilities have shown sensitivity to production behavior based on the degree of reservoir depletion / injection.|","characterization, faults and fractures, permeability, geomechanics"

Optimizing the drilling and completion phases of a typical oil or gas wellbore requires geomechanical analysis to characterize the in-situ stresses. Stress profiles and lateral tectonic stresses can be determined and calibrated through MicroFrac testing and by modeling borehole breakouts observed in borehole image logs. 
Several wells in the Campamento 1 field (the first field in the Neuquen Basin) were drilled with the tight basement formation in the Neuquen province in Argentina as the primary target. These wells were evaluated to estimate the stress profile using anisotropic mechanical properties and to identify suitable intervals to fracture. There are several tests and analyses that can typically be used to calibrate horizontal stresses. These tests and analyses include leak-off test (LOT), extended leak-off test (XLOT), minifrac test, step-rate-injection test (SRT), MicroFrac test, core strain measurement (Anelastic Strain Recovery, ASR), analysis of borehole breakouts and induced fractures from specific image logs. 
The objective of this paper is to show the use of borehole breakouts and hydraulically induced fracture initiation and closure pressures to calibrate the magnitude of the horizontal stresses in a vertical well. Breakouts are typically more visible in an acoustic image log and are expected to occur in formations with lower strength and/or lower internal friction coefficient but sometimes they occur in intervals with high strength and stiffness sustaining high horizontal tectonic stresses. 
Examples are shown in the Campamento 1 field wells with borehole breakouts and minifrac data used in constraining the magnitude of the lateral tectonic strains. The horizontal stress profiles obtained from these vertical wellbores provide valuable information for predicting hydraulic fracture geometry, propagation and containment for subsequent reservoir stimulation jobs. Two vertical wells where coupled calibration with minifrac data and breakout modeling were done are presented to show how this calibration is achieved and how it helps to constrain the magnitude of the horizontal stresses in a vertical well. 
The results show how observed borehole breakouts and fracture pressures can help in constraining the magnitude of the lateral tectonic strains. These are important parameters in estimating the horizontal stress profile in the target reservoir and the stress contrast over the sub-adjacent and supra-adjacent formations.|","Lateral tectonic strain, Horizontal principal stress, In-situ stress, Borehole breakout"

Because fracture gradient changes with rock type, some formations are more sensitive to induced fractures than others. Depending upon depth, the fractures created will either be horizontal or vertical. If the depth is 2500 feet or less, horizontal fractures are usually produced. Because horizontal fractures require lifting the entire overburden, they are limited to shallow depths. At depths over 3500 feet, fractures are usually vertical. Because vertical fractures occur without lifting the overburden, they can be created at much lower pressure. The propagation pressure is generally much less than the pressure that would be required to initiate the fracture. Consequently, fracture losses, once initiated, are difficult to control. 
Wellbore instability, particularly in shale formations, is a major challenge in drilling operations. Many factors such as rock properties, in-situ stresses, chemical interactions between shale and drilling fluids, and thermal effects must be taken into consideration in well trajectory designs and drilling fluid formulations to mitigate wellbore instability-related problems. 
The Steerable Drilling Liner service combines a rotary steerable system with a liner to help overcome the challenges: drilling in zones with lower pressure and unstable shale/coal layers, and with formations of varying flow and pressure regimes. Running the liner while drilling keeps the wellbore stable and eliminates the need to pull the drillstring to run casing. This is how it reduces your risks and NPT, saving the costs associated with contingency plans. Because the liner is isolated from the reamer shoe, you can rotate the liner at much lower RPMs than the pilot and reamer bits. This design lessens the load on the liner, improving its fatigue life. 
The Steerable Drilling Liner steerable drilling liner service helps you to mitigate the risk of hole collapse and formation damage by reducing openhole exposure, Reduce NPT by eliminating extra trips and ensuring that the liner is installed at TD from the first run 
Enhance wellbore integrity by drilling with the liner, leading to the plastering effect, which reduces fluid loss and cuttings volume, Lower health, safety, and environmental (HSE) risks by reducing pipe handling and rigsite footprint size 
Steerable Drilling Liner service developed and qualified using a rigorous processes including extensive onshore testing at the service provider Experimental Test Area (BETA) facility before being successfully deployed offshore. Rely on Steerable Drilling Liner service performance in extreme environments; the cost-effective Steerable Drilling Liner service promotes wellbore stability and performs reliably in the challenging downhole environments.

The ongoing drilling campaign for an operator drilling in Egypt's Western desert area involved drilling vertical and directional wells approximately 5,000- to 5,500-m deep. The application involved drilling through very hard and abrasive sandstones, and intercalations of shale, sand, silt and dense dolomite inter-beds of about 25,000 psi unconfined compressive strength (UCS). Historically, poly crystalline diamond compact (PDC) drill-bit showed inconsistent bit performance that included premature bit failure and low rate of penetration (ROP), resulting in costly bit trips to the surface. 
New and improved bit technology was required to improve the penetration rate and footage to reduce bit trips to the surface and improve the overall drilling performance. An in-depth study of the formation properties, wireline logs, drilling parameters and bit dull analysis was performed. Detailed analysis identified this application can benefit from running cutters with a non- planar cutting face on a field-proven seven- blade PDC bit frame. The bit was run on a Rotary Steerable System (RSS) coupled with a positive displacement motor (PDM) on top of the BHA to further improve the drilling efficiency and overcome any challenges. 
Upon deployment, the 8<U+00BD>-in bit design with the new 16-mm cutters with non-planar cutting structure combined with optimized depth-of-cut control, stability, hydraulics efficiency and balling prevention features led to improved performance when drilling the complex, hook-shaped well profile (where torque and drag were an issue in the past). Compared to field offsets, the bit drilled very smoothly and aided the operator in placing the well in the correct direction with minimum bit- torque caused from bit and formation interaction. Offset bits fail to achieve the required directional plan in the past because of the severe nature of drilling in the area. 
This integrated solution resulted in a 15% improvement in the ROP as compared to the offsets and a 57% improvement in footage drilled. This performance replaced six drill bits, which were used to drill the same interval in the offset wells. The new innovative PDC cutter technology saved the operator at least USD 250,000 from the planned authority for expenditure (AFE) cost, as well as set two consecutive footage records. This paper outlines the problems in drilling this challenging area, the thought process behind using the various technologies incorporated in the PDC bit design and the keys to overall success.|","Cutter Technology, Step-change, PDC, Optimized, Advanced"

Analyzing well performance is a complex process that increases in difficulty when multiple reservoir-drive mechanisms are in play in the same reservoir. This paper explores an overpressured, compacting chalk reservoir with high porosity and high oil saturation at initial conditions. The diverse drive mechanisms, experienced through the long production history of Valhall field in Norway, are caused by different degrees of reservoir compaction across the field and the recent waterflood at the crest and northern areas of the field. 
The purpose of this study is to illuminate the various drive mechanisms experienced in this field. The underlying objective is to understand widely varying Arps b-factors in decline-curve analysis (DCA) that support production forecasting and project evaluation. The performances of inactive wells with long production histories were used as analogs to analyze active wells. Other analytical tools were also used to augment overall understanding of a type well's performance, including rate-transient analysis (RTA) and capacitance-resistance modeling (CRM). 
This study demonstrates that the proposed workflow for reservoir performance forecasting can be adopted in highly complex reservoirs with different rock mechanical properties, drive mechanisms, production scheduling, and field development strategies. Specifically, the workflow entails establishing energy support for individual wells using Arps b-factor with DCA; collapsing shut-in periods, if any, and using the cumulative production curve for DCA to retain solution objectivity; performing RTA to gauge pressure/rate coherence and system's linearity; and using CRM to establish injector-producer connectivity.|","Variable Arps b-factor tied to drive mechanisms, Understanding variable reservoir drive-mechanisms, Other analytical tools helped understanding DCA, New integrated-curve analysis for intermittent pro"

Failure of umbilicals such as leakage or blockage in the hydraulic lines can be a challenge during operation of subsea infrastructures such as Christmas trees. These failures cause loss of redundancy and, in worst case, the operator will lose control of important valve functions on the trees. In that instance, the operator is forced to shut down production to perform costly umbilical repair or replacement prior to resuming operation. 
As an alternative to umbilical repair and replacement, Siemens has developed a compact subsea hydraulic power unit (SHPU) for installation close to the subsea tree. The unit is intended as a standardized part of the operators’ toolbox, and is connected to the tree by Subsea Instrumentation Interface Standardization (SIIS) level 2 interfaces. The SHPU will take available electrical power from the existing infrastructure at the well site, and store it in a battery based energy bank. When hydraulic power is needed for valve operations on the well system, it will be provided by a pump driven by an electrical motor. Installation and retrieval of the SHPU can be done using a typical inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) Vessel with a lift wire and remote operated vehicle (ROV) assistance. 
The SHPU may also be used as a building block to develop long step-out developments in a cost-efficient way. By producing the hydraulic power locally at the seabed, it is possible to remove the hydraulic lines of the umbilical and thereby gain significant reductions in investments.|","Umbilical repair, Hydraulic Power Unit, Cost saving, Subsea tree"

As the drilling technology has advanced, recent deepwater developments and explorations are currently taking place in Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West Africa where deeper reserves of oil have become more accessible. The study of the subsea soil (e.g. soil investigation, positioning foundation design) is one of the activities required for the subsea field development. Electromagnetic tests, CPT tests, gravity, piston core or vibrocore samples are obtained by deploying down-hole systems from drilling vessels. However, because of the high costs and low availability of drill ships, and because ship and drill-string motion due to wind, currents and waves affect the quality of the drilling process, robotic drill rigs are currently more widely used. The following paper describes the MeBo200 as a novel underwater drill rig for geotechnical/geological explorations. The MeBo200 drilling rig is lowered to the sea floor and operated remotely from the ship to drill up to 200m into the sea floor at an ambient pressure of up to 400bar. It was developed in cooperation by MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences (University of Bremen) and BAUER Maschinen GmbH. The complete system is transported within seven 20 ft containers. MeBo200 is a second generation of the MeBo, which was the first remote-controlled deep sea drill rig that uses a wireline coring technique. The weight of the MeBo200 is about 10 tons in air and 8 tons in water and therefore it does not need special drill ships to be managed reducing therefore the mobilization costs for worldwide deployment. The MeBo200 was deployed in the German sector of the North Sea in October 2014 to test the functionality of the seabed-based drill rig.

Several engineering technologies developed over the past decade are readily available for operators to help enhance production. The advantages of technology integration for creating multiple transverse fractures in horizontal wellbores have been well documented. |Given the rapid pace of development, many operators strive to standardize completion programs to drive consistency and efficiency in operations and well performance. The key parameters that maximize production in unconventional reservoirs are not dissimilar to the key parameters proven successful time and again in conventional completion designs and fracturing treatments. Generating fracture complexity may be important in unconventional reservoirs, but maximum reservoir contact does not necessarily translate to an effectively stimulated reservoir. Fracture length, fracture conductivity and fracture spacing in multi-cluster/multi-stage completions are first-order parameters that can be engineered. However, additional completion and design considerations for unconventional wells such as natural fracture saturation, mid-field fracture complexity, mechanical fracture interaction and transverse fracture production interference must be considered to enhance production and maximize economics. |This paper will focus on technology integration for the Wolfcamp A reservoir using a discrete fracture network (DFN) model for predicting fracture geometry, formation evaluation, oil and fluid tracers, microseismic monitoring and production history matching.

In permeability challenged reservoirs, overall success of the hydraulic fracture operation is measured by this fracture conductivity. Different techniques have been used to increase fracture conductivity by employing a variety of proppant placement strategies. One strategy is to involve alternating (i.e. pulsed) stages of proppant-containing fluids and proppant-free fluids to form heterogeneously distributed proppant clusters and highly conductive flow channels in between each cluster. If engineered accurately, proppant clusters can withstand closure stresses (reducing embedment or crush risk), and result in longer effective fracture length(s) with improved conductivity. |While there are a number of approaches to modify or adjust treatment schedules to optimize clustered proppant placement, many of these suffer from a consideration of only one or two aspects of a fracturing operation. There is a need for a physics based integrated methodology which couples advanced flow and geomechanical models (with production analysis) to optimize engineering design and proppant placement. In this study, clustered proppant design optimization is demonstrated within the framework of an integrated geomechanics-flow-reservoir workflow. The workflow combines quick look analysis (i.e. candidate screening) with advanced computational models (i.e. geomechanical, flow and reservoir models).

The development of overpressure means that the fluid movement in the pores is retarded, both vertically and laterally. In many Tertiary basins, overpressure is mainly generated by compaction disequilibrium caused by a high deposition rate and low permeability in shales. In the Malay basin, temperature and high heat flow also play an important role in generating overpressure at a shallow depth, because the geothermal gradient is very high (40–60C/km). Pore-pressure profiles and crossplots of sonic velocity/vertical effective stress and of velocity/density are used to derive the overpressure-generating mechanisms. The results obtained from the crossplots of 10 wells reveal that in the study area, overpressure is generated by both primary (compactiondisequilibrium) and secondary (fluid-expansion) mechanisms. The overpressure-magnitude analysis suggests that the overpressure generated by the secondary mechanism is very high compared with the primary mechanism. In all the wells, the Eaton (1972) method with an exponent of 3 gives good prediction when overpressure is the result of the compaction-disequilibrium mechanism, but it underpredicted the high pore pressure where the fluid expansion mechanism is also present. However, by use of a higher Eaton exponent of 5 for the fluid-expansion mechanism, the overpressures are predicted quite well. The Bowers (1995) method, by use of the unloading parameter (U) of 6, is also used for pressure prediction and it gives a reasonably good prediction in the high overpressure zone of all the wells.|","geohazard, geothermal, pore pressure, mechanism, prediction"

Full-domain computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of random wave and structure interaction is considered impractical by many researchers. Simplified approaches are usually adopted to alleviate expensive CFD random wave simulation. In this paper, we present a rigorous methodology that solves the Navier–Stokes equations entirely without any need for matching. In our simulation scenario, a container ship cruising at a constant speed is allowed to heave and pitch in random waves. Both head-sea bow slamming at a speed of 6 knots and following-sea stern slamming at 0 and 5 knots are studied. Irregular waves are used to simulate a realistic seaway environment. A very effective procedure is developed to capture the desired waves at a specific part of the sailing vessel. A level-set function is employed to capture the violent free surface and to simulate the interaction of the random wave and the ship. This rigorous Navier–Stokes numerical approach is able to capture complex mechanisms and show results that are possible only with CFD simulations, thus providing useful information for ship designs. |Introduction |Research on ship maneuvering and sea-keeping is conventionally done with potential flow codes. Though the practice enjoys quick results and low computational costs, it is incapable of treating some critical events like green water, breaking waves, and extreme slamming. For these relatively short-term extreme scenarios, it is logical to perform computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation based on more realistic physics, although it becomes substantially more expensive in the complex setup preparation and longer computational time. Green water and slamming on ships and offshore structures have long been problems causing great concern and generating many studies. In rough seas, a vessel’s bow and stern may occasionally emerge from seawater and reenter it with a heavy impact. The vessel experiences high-pressure impact loads between the vessel’s hull and water surface. These impact loads are of a transient nature and can cause serious structural damage. Severe green water may also affect the stability of the ship and cause considerable structural damage. It is thus important to estimate the magnitude of the impact loads and the peak pressure for structural design purposes. CFD simulation of slamming phenomena is challenging. Due to the transient nature of slamming, a simulation in the time domain requires a time increment sufficiently small to capture the peak impact pressure. This makes the computation very time consuming. Both the large motion of the vessel and the violent free surface must be solved accurately for a realistic wave–structure interaction. Simulating and capturing the desired irregular wave for a cruising ship add another level of difficulty. Full-domain CFD simulation of random wave and structure interaction has been deemed impractical by many researchers. Regular waves are commonly substituted in the case of a ship with forward speed.|","CFD,  green water,  bow slamming,  following sea,  head sea,  random waves,  stern slamming"

The sloshing flow becomes more violent and results in an intense liquid impact as the excitation period gets closer to the resonance period of the internal liquid. This sloshing impact is the most critical load component in the structural design of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Cargo Containment System (CCS) of an LNG carrier or Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG). In this study, the structural assessment of sloshing loads was performed for a two-row Mark III membrane-type CCS of an FLNG. The CCS was designed to be installed in a gas field in northwestern Australia where the wind-sea and swell components were simultaneously measured. Two distinct sea states of special interest were considered for the structural analysis. One included sea states on the contour line corresponding to a 100-year return period in a wave scatter diagram. These sea states are usually used for the prediction of the extreme motions of floaters and are termed extreme sea states. The other included sea states with a high probability of occurrence. These sea states are used for investigating the effect of long-term exposure to sloshing loads on CCS structures. An evaluation of the structural safety of the CCS and hull structures was conducted by the use of a sequence of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-based scenario screenings, sloshing model tests, and statistical fittings of Utilization Ratios (URs). It was found that all probable sea states had to be fully considered when the screening for the sloshing assessment was performed. Even though the sea states with a high probability of occurrence had smaller significant wave heights than the extreme sea states, they might cause the largest sloshing loads and structural responses. |Introduction |The new global energy strategy is gradually focusing on natural gas due to economic benefits from conventional petroleum resources. A number of offshore gas reservoirs, which were uninteresting in the past, are now being commercialized, and as a result, new Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) development projects related to natural gas production are being executed. In the case of FLNGs, it is not possible to impose restrictions on the filling level of the liquefied natural gas cargo during continuous operation; thus, significantly violent sloshing phenomena can occur. This is in contrast to LNG carriers that operate under restricted filling conditions. Therefore, the sloshing resistance of an FLNG CCS and the adjacent hull structure is one of the most important design parameters for the structural safety of an FLNG. With respect to the structural design, it is not easy to determine the design sloshing loads absolutely because the LNG sloshing is a highly nonlinear impact phenomenon. Although the model tests can measure the impact pressure, the direct use of the measured pressures in the design is still controversial due to uncertainty regarding the scale effects and cryogenic characteristics. This is why the common practice is to comparatively assess the structural capacities of the CCS of a target vessel and those of a reference vessel, which is proposed by Classification Societies (ABS, 2006; BV, 2011a, 2011b; DNV, 2006).|","model test,  Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG),  Utilization Ratio (UR), Sloshing,  bimodal seas,  contour-line approach,  wave intensity,  Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF),  Cargo Containment System (CCS),  all-sea-states approach"

Foam has been successfully used for profile control in mature reservoirs for the advantages of easy preparation, selectively plugging capacity, effective profile control and displacement efficiency capacity. However, the stability of foam is a serious problem for scale applications in oilfields. Due to viscoelasticity, strong shearing stability, high temperature and salinity resistance of micron dispersed particle gel (DPG), it was prepared to stabilize foam. 
The micron DPG particles were prepared using bulk gel by high shearing method in our lab (C.L. Dai, et al., 2012). A new three phase foam system was successfully prepared by adding micron DPG particles through a modification of Ross-Mile method. The foaming capacity, stability and morphology were systemically investigated. The plugging capacity and enhanced oil recovery capacity of new three phase foam have been also investigated by sand-pack flowing tests. 
The effects of surfactant concentration, DPG particle concentration, salinity, oil concentration and gas-liquid ratio on the foaming capacity of three phase foam are systematically investigated. Increasing in surfactant concentration, DPG particles concentration and gas-liquid ratio can improve the foam volume and decay half-life of three phase foam, whereas increasing in salinity and oil concentration decrease the foam volume and decay half-life. By increasing in solution viscosity, adsorption at gas-liquid interface and non-adsorption in solution, the DPG particles can effectively stabilize new three phase foam. Morphology results show that the formed new three phase foam is compact and uniform. Sand-pack experimental results show that the new three phase foam has a better plugging capacity and enhanced oil recovery capacity than traditional aqueous phase foam. The new three phase foam may have a great potential for profile control in mature reservoirs.|","Dispersed particle gel, Stability, Morphology, Ehanced oil recovery, 3-phase foam"

In this paper, we present a framework to model low-tension gas flood process and implement the model into the UT in-house compositional gas reservoir simulator (UT-DOECO2). A gas compositional model is coupled with microemulsion phase behavior to capture important mechanisms in hybrid gas-chemical flood processes in porous media. 
Two different surfactant molecules are simultaneously applied: one to lower interfacial tension to ultra-low values and one to keep foam stable as gas mobility control agent. This process cannot currently be modeled using the commercial reservoir simulators. We implemented the option for two surfactants into the existing gas compositional simulator with foam and hysteresis options. A predictive simulator would make it possible to select the best candidates for field application and tailor process design to particular characteristics of each field. 
In the field-scale application of the Surfactant Alternating Gas (SAG) process, multiphase fluid behavior in porous media is modeled using three-phase compositional relative permeability and three-phase hysteresis models to include both compositional and saturation history effects. These models represent a more-accurate prediction of the cycle-dependent properties of SAG. The gas entrapment in the foam flow is used to predict the hysteresis effect within each cycle using a dynamic Land coefficient. The in-situ foaming behavior is estimated based on the mechanistic foam models. This study, further, evaluates mobilization and displacement of residual oil in tight reservoirs using the low-tension gas flood and compares the results with other EOR options. 
Using a reliable multiphase simulator low-tension gas experiments can be scaled up to the field and to optimize chemical-gas EOR process design. Numerical simulation of the SAG with and without hysteresis is used to assess the effect of the gas-entrapment on oil recovery and gas utilization factor in a field-scale application.|","three-phase hysteresis, low-tension gas flood, three-phase compositional relative permeability, SAG, foam flow"

A method of constructing high productivity and high wellbore dynamic stability wells has been developed for EOR field development application. It integrates a heuristic reservoir engineering modelling method for determining optimum drainage points with high dynamic flow and a 3D coupled reservoir geomechanical modelling method for identifying low sanding propensity regions within the entire reservoir. The reservoir geomechanical method couples dynamic reservoir modelling with geomechanical modelling. It can account for in-situ stress changes associated with reservoir pressure change, and predict any potential geomechanical-related physical events for the remaining life of the field. Correspondingly, the generated drainage map and 3D sand production critical drawdown cubes can then be combined to identify global optimum well placement locations within the reservoir, layer by layer. 
Drainage points selected by this heuristic reservoir modelling method can be correlated with their respective EUR (Estimated Ultimate Recovery) values, while the 3D critical drawdown cubes can identify reservoir regions with low sanding propensity. This combined approach can therefore lead to the development of multi-layer commingle wells having various angles of reservoir penetration, for optimizing well productivity and EUR value without the requirement of sand control. Illustrated by a case study in brownfield reservoirs, a non-linear well trajectory which maximizes reservoir fluid contact in a prolific sand layer can be designed without any sand control completion for sanding mitigation through optimization and management of production plan.|","Geo-Mechanical Model Simulation, EOR field well development, High Wellbore Stability, High productivity, Dynamic Drainage Model Simulation"

The Bakken petroleum system (BPS) can be considered a hybrid play because it is composed of both conventional and unconventional elements. The conventional aspects include the presence of separate reservoir intervals (Scallion, Middle Bakken, Sanish and Three Forks) and source rock intervals (Lower Bakken and Upper Bakken shales) along with more problematic intervals (Basal Bakken). This is in direct contrast to most unconventional shale plays, in which a single lithologic or stratigraphic interval comprises both the source rock and reservoir. The unconventional aspects of the BPS include very low permeability conventional reservoir sections, as well as combined shale-rich source and reservoir intervals. Additional complexity results from stacked depositional environments with significant variations in lithofacies, mineralogy, total organic carbon (TOC), and rock textures ranging from highly bioturbated to finely laminated.
Historically, development programs and petrophysical analyses in the Bakken were centered on a volume of shale calculated via deterministic models using triple combo log data that were focused primarily on the Middle Bakken reservoir. Production type-curves generated from such analyses showed reservoir recovery factors that were inconsistent with actual production data as well as knowledge of the reservoir. Additionally, rock mechanical properties used to model hydraulic fracturing performance and real-time measurements of microseismic events recorded during hydraulic fracturing indicated fracture height growth that extended into surrounding formations.
Based on these results, a series of science wells were drilled, cored over the entire BPS and logged extensively using advanced logging devices to better understand the overall system. Results from these wells provide a basis to refine production type curves and to re-calculate stock-tank oil originally in place (STOOIP). The formation evaluation program consisted of conventional triple combo logs supplemented with advanced downhole measurements including: (1) triaxial resistivity for thin-bed analysis; (2) nuclear magnetic resonance for porosity, free fluid and kerogen identification; (3) dielectric dispersion for water saturation; (4) geochemical spectroscopy for mineralogy and total organic carbon (TOC); and (5) dipole sonic for dynamic rock properties. Petrophysical models were developed using both deterministic and probabilistic methods to integrate the measurements acquired for analysis of porosity, saturation, and mineralogy, and describing the hydrocarbon production potential of the BPS more accurately. The advanced evaluation results will enable the development of computation models in areas of the basin where only minimal logging suites such as triple combo logs exist as data. Petrophysical models that encompass the entire BPS will be the basis for updated STOOIP calculations that can be used to revise production type curves and improve confidence in estimated recovery factors that have better agreement with measured production results.|","Document Type

Sonic and density logs are essential for quantitative geophysics studies linking seismic amplitudes to reservoir properties. Vp and Vs values measured by the acoustic tools influence: elastic property calculations, seismic-to-well ties, wavelet extraction, fluid substitution and amplitude versus offset (AVO) modeling.
Modern acoustic tools use sources that transmit sound energy across a range of frequencies. The energy propagates through mud, formation, and back through the mud again before the signal reaching the tool transducers. During this energy transit, and in the subsequent data processing, the factors that can influence the quality of the data include:
• Wellbore and formation conditions: For example, hole size, borehole geometry, mud properties, variation in formation velocity relative to mud velocity for consolidated or unconsolidated (soft or ultra-soft formation), and formation shear velocity relative to the mud velocity. 
• Data processing methodology: The sonic tool is not directly measuring the slowness and velocity. It is only via processing of the travel time of wave propagation relative to the receiver array spacing that it can be calculated. 
• Frequency effects: Not all formations respond equally at all frequencies. There is a necessary trade-off between decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the flexural mode that drives the shear slowness versus reducing the size of the dispersion correction at lower frequencies. Identification of mixing acoustic modes, problematic receivers, and reading consistency can also be difficult.
This paper discusses how these factors can impact on the quality of acoustic data acquired, highlighting the differences between wireline and LWD technologies, and presents a practical work flow that can be employed to optimize data quality.
Quantitative seismic studies link the measurement of acoustic properties in the wellbore (e.g. Vp, Vs) to observed seismic properties though the development of synthetic seismic traces, well ties, fluid substitution and AVO studies (Figure 1 and 2). Ensuring high quality wellbore acoustic data is acquired to ensuring appropriate results are achieved.|","Document Type

Multiple fractures or an extensive fracture network is critical for commercially viable production from low permeability formations, such as shales. Mechanical anisotropy is inherent in shales because of its platy nature. This inherent anisotropy makes fracture prediction in shales more complex, and traditional methods to predict fracture geometry assuming isotropy frequently prove to be inadequate. Current analytical methods boldly assume a constant fracture height and constant mechanical properties for the entire height. Common 3D fracture modeling software are based on isotropic rock models, and models that take anisotropy into account are computationally expensive and time consuming, especially when numerous simulations must be performed by varying the input parameters for parametric study.
This paper proposes a workflow to improve the prediction of fracture geometry in anisotropic formations. The workflow involves generating a neural network by using a limited number of 3D fracture modeling cases. After the neural network is obtained from a pilot or offset well, it can be easily embedded into software for optimizing fracture design, identifying geologic sweet spots, and predicting fracture propagation and correlating the results to other horizontal or vertical wells in the same geological area.
This process can be divided into three steps. First, the anisotropic models are used to predict horizontal and vertical Young’s modulus (Ehorz and Evert), Poisson’s ratio (<U+028B>horz and <U+028B>vert), and anisotropic minimum horizontal stress (<U+03C3>hmin_ani) from sonic and density log measurements. Second, the elastic moduli properties and <U+03C3>hmin_ani are entered into a 3D fracture modeling simulator to run different cases by varying the completion input parameters. The outputs of the fracture simulator (i.e., the fracture length, height, width, and effective length) serve as a training database to the neural network. In the final step, a neural network is generated based on the training database. After the reservoir-specific neural network is developed, fracture geometry can be predicted or optimized for numerous combinations of completion input parameters in a timely and cost effective manner. Because the commonly available commercial fracture modeling software assumes isotropy, a new method is presented in this paper to represent mechanical property anisotropy using equivalent Young’s modulus (Eeq) and Poisson’s ratio (<U+03C3>eq). Eeq and <U+03C3>eq are derived from Ehorz, Evert, <U+03C3>horz, and <U+03C3>vert and the isotropic (Sneddon and Berry 1958) and anisotropic (Chertov 2012) width functions.
This workflow is demonstrated by generating a neural network for two reservoirs using anisotropic elastic moduli as predicted by the dipole sonic log. The fracture geometry predicted by the neural network is compared with the conventional method, assuming the isotropic shale rock. The results show that by assuming an isotropic model the fracture width is overestimated, and the fracture containment and propped length are underestimated. The anisotropic neural network model is further run in a large parametric study to demonstrate how the effective length varies with perforation position, injection volume, and injection rate. The results helped to optimize perforation depth, injection rate, and pumped volume. |","Document Type

"843","2015-Q","Dielectric Responses of Carbonates from an Albian Carbonate Reservoir, Campos Basin, Brazil","Clennell, Ben, CSIRO| Josh, Matthew, CSIRO| Han, Tongcheng, CSIRO| Esteban, Lionel, CSIRO","|Abstract
The iGEM-4D research project combined petrophysics, geophysics, geomechanics and digital rock modelling to investigate and predict the 4D seismic responses of Albian carbonate reservoirs in offshore Brazil using 48 core plug samples. The plugs include a range of lithofacies from peloidal grainstones, oncolitic packstones to floatstones. X-ray/SEM images and petrophysical properties were measured prior to destructive geomechanical and rock physics testing of the plugs: helium porosity and permeability, brine-saturated low field NMR spectroscopy, benchtop ultrasonic velocity measurement, and dielectric spectroscopy.
For the dielectric study, discs of 7-9 mm thickness were cut from the end of each core plug, and these were measured in dry, humidified and brine-saturated state in a custom parallel plate cell. The main suite of measurements used direct coupling of the fluid saturated rock to the gold plated electrodes; the brine-metal interaction inevitably causes electrode polarization effects that limit the lower frequency range of the measurement. A protocol developed at CSIRO was used to extend the range of measurement to low frequencies using polymer film to block electrode contact and eliminate polarization. The full range of permittivity measurement is thereby extended from sub-MHz to 110 MHz. While the rocks are essentially clay free, rather weak surface polarization can be discerned in the low frequency brine-saturated data and in the response of the humidified samples. The spectra also indicate that the water affinity of the pore surfaces is weak, perhaps from incomplete oil cleaning of all the fine pore space by toluene-methanol treatment. It is also possible that treatment changed the wetting property of the pore surfaces to become hydrophobic to some extend. At the 100 MHz frequency the data fit a CRIM mixing law very well, and this would imply little dispersion from 100 MHz up to the GHz range would be expected for these rocks.
We found moderate correlations between porosity, permeability and dielectric properties of the carbonates that were superior to correlations between conductivity and the pore/flow characteristics. An unexpectedly strong correlation was found between the dielectric constant and the slowness of ultrasonic waves measured at the benchtop on the same disc samples. This may represent the analogy between CRIM and a time-average wave speed equation.
The dispersions in conductivity and permittivity with and frequencies << 100 MHz are not well fitted by a simple model based on the Hanai-Bruggeman description for grain / brine inclusions with a single shape factor (analogous to an Archie m exponent) for the pore space. This is expected as the pore structures seen in SEM images and x-ray micro-CT images of the samples are complex and display a large range in size and aspect ratios. Indeed, NMR analysis using conventional CPMG measurement of T2 completely fails to capture the pore size (< 100 µm: meso- and micro-scale) distributions of these rocks because of pore coupling effects and weak surface relaxation. While our work is not definitive, it does suggest that dielectric laboratory and logging methods may have advantages for pore structure characterization and for estimation of some useful physical properties in carbonates (e.g. elastic moduli), especially when NMR requires slow logging speeds and multi-dimensional acquisition and processing methods to overcome pore coupling problems. |","Document Type

Increasingly, more high-angle (HA) and horizontal (HZ) wells have been drilled in recent years because of the accelerated development of offshore exploration and onshore organic-shale development. Conventional waveform processing methods are developed only for vertical wells. When used in HA/HZ wells, these methods may yield biased estimations of P- and S-wave slownesses. New methods are needed to process sonic waveforms acquired in HA/HZ wells, specifically in the vicinity of layer boundaries and in the presence of thin layers.|This paper examines several HA/HZ borehole models when a sonic tool operates across a horizontal bed boundary. High-resolution 3D numerical simulations of sonic waveforms are carried out with a time-domain finite-difference method coupled with a complex, frequency-shifted, perfectly matched layer to study the transient acoustic fields measured in and out of the borehole. These simulations assume a 3D sonic logging tool with multipole sources and 13<U+00D7>8 azimuthal receivers. Both monopole and dipole synthetic waveforms are obtained in HA/HZ boreholes penetrating hard and soft formations. Instead of the conventional processing of monopole or dipole waveforms that takes the average, or difference, of waveforms acquired with azimuthal receivers, we separately analyze the sonic waveforms at each azimuthal receiver. Waveforms are first processed with a weighted spectral semblance method to yield modal dispersions; next, we reconstruct formation shear slowness from these dispersion curves with a dispersion correction method. The top and bottom receiver slowness is chosen when the tool measurement point is in the formation above and below the well, respectively. Results indicate that this new procedure provides unbiased estimations of rock formation shear slowness compared to conventional processing. Moreover, the difference between top and bottom receiver slowness reflects the elastic property contrast between the formation section above and below the well, enabling the accurate evaluation of formation heterogeneity due to bed boundary effects in HA/HZ wells.|The new sonic waveform interpretation approach introduced in this paper is ideal for the elastic/mechanical assessment of organic shale, in which rock heterogeneity is commonplace.|","Document Type

The present paper aims to show the results of the Pulsed Neutron Through-casing technology in a well in the Neuquen Basin, Argentina.|This mineralogy service has got its origins in the openhole pulsed neutron generator; elemental concentrations can be further depicted by spectroscopic analysis of the measured gamma ray after applying borehole corrections in open hole conditions. Fit-for-purpose software enables lithological and quantitative mineralogical information to be obtained. For more than seven years, this service has proven successful as a differentiator in the determination of key minerals by the measurement of elements in the capture and inelastic spectrum. The challenges of applying this technology in a cased-hole environment included defining relevant corrections for casing and cement gamma ray attenuation effects and their respective contribution effects. This new technology has achieved this goal by processing the acquired data with proprietary algorithms based on sets of lab experiments and tool in-casedhole response standards. The elemental concentrations are corrected for concrete and casing effects and then, processed by the interpretation system to determine the lithology and mineralogy of the zone of interest.
This paper shows the comparison between open hole and cased hole data in the same interval of a well logged for YPF –a leading company in E&P in Argentina- in the Neuquen Basin, with successful results in lithological and mineralogical classification in siliciclastic and carbonatic formations. This comparison not only proved an agreement in the mineralogy determination between open hole and cased hole measurements, but also in the determination of total organic carbon (TOC). These results are confirmed by good agreement with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of cutting samples.|This new technology brings solutions to the oil industry, by lowering operative risks and costs respect to open-hole logging, and it can also be performed in present and older cased-hole wells where the target zone has been by-passed. |","Document Type

Relationships between compressional and shear wave velocities were established in the classic paper by Castagna et al. (1985).

The work of Brie et al. (1995) extended the work of Castagna et al. (1985) to include predicting gas saturation from a Vp/Vs vs. compressional traveltime crossplot. In this crossplot, Brie proposes one non-linear trend for water-wet sands and another non-linear trend for shales. In addition, the Brie Vp/Vs vs. compressional traveltime crossplot has a greater sensitivity to low velocities or large compressional traveltimes.|This paper compares some of the more famous rock physic trends, including the Castagna mudrock and Brie water-wet sands and shales, in both the Vp vs. Vs crossplot and the Vp/Vs vs. compressional traveltime crossplot.

Borehole multicomponent induction (MCI) logging has been successfully used throughout the last decade for evaluation of various types of anisotropic formations, such as laminated shaly sands and low-resistivity reservoirs, by means of the determined resistivity anisotropy (horizontal and vertical resistivity), dip, and dip azimuth. Recently, a new application of the MCI logging was reported for characterization of formation fractures through fracture detection and assessment of fracture parameters. This new application is a very important step in oil/gas exploration and development because it can significantly help improve drilling and completion decisions made regarding fractured formations. However, to date, literature published related to this new application has been minimal.
Currently, MCI data processing and interpretation schemes are usually based on a transversely isotropic (TI) formation model for fracture characterization. The primary reason is because formations are commonly bedded or laminated, so the TI-model assumption is reasonable under these conditions. In reality, subsurface formations frequently contain different types of (natural or non-natural; open or closed) fractures (or faults), where fractured formations very often display azimuthal resistivity anisotropy in the bedding plane, which leads to biaxial anisotropy (BA) in formation resistivity (or conductivity). Therefore, the MCI data processing and interpretation based on the TI models is no longer valid in complex formations where BA is caused by fractures. Moreover, the hydrocarbon exploration and development is currently in need of new MCI processing and interpretation methods based on the BA formation models so that a more accurate description of fractured laminated reservoirs can be provided. It is well known that fractures can significantly affect fluid flow in formations and a more accurate model of fractures can lead to optimized oil/gas development and production, particularly in unconventional reservoirs. Based on the BA formation models and through exploitation of the equivalence between fractured formation models and BA models, a practical integrated method and workflow were developed with multi-array MCI tensor data for effective determination of formation BA anisotropy (or triaxial resistivities: Rx, Ry, and Rz), dip, and dip azimuth in fractured formations. Because of the complexity of the fracture characterization, a few new fracture identification (FID) functions with a combination of multiple log-data inputs have been proposed for detection of fracture existence, followed by an approach for quantitative estimation of fracture orientation/azimuth, dip, density, etc. along a wellbore.
The newly developed method and workflow were applied to synthetic and field data sets for validation and case studies. The application results clearly demonstrate that more accurate triaxial formation anisotropy and dip can be obtained using the new method based on the BA models, compared to the TI processed logs. This allows fractures to be more accurately characterized by integrating corrected tensor measurements (e.g., borehole-corrected MCI logs) and multiple inverted log data, such as two horizontal resistivities (Rx and Ry), vertical resistivity, and formation dips based on the combination of both BA and TI models. Furthermore, this new application also paves the way to more accurately evaluate different types of fractures in formations, such as shaly sands, carbonates, and unconventional reservoirs using MCI measurements and integration of other sensor log data (e.g., imaging and sonic data). |","Document Type

Petrophysical analysis for determining porosity and water saturation in complex mineralogy can be challenging owing to the strong effect of light hydrocarbons on sensors such as density-neutron, nuclear magnetic resonance, and sonic sensors. In the new frontier areas of offshore Brazil and East Africa, complex mineralogy that results from the presence of feldspars, heavy minerals, and varying clay types further complicates traditional log interpretation methods. When drilling uses oil-base mud, additional uncertainty arises from the varying amount of invasion of the filtrate and its effect on log response. In such situations, using acoustic dipole shear and flexural wave dispersion data coupled with induction logs in the petrophysical workflow provides an alternative method for evaluating porosity and water saturation. Shear and flexural wave data are less influenced by fluid, and coupling the radial response of the flexural wave data with array induction logs by using a pixel-based joint inversion can provide porosity and water saturation profiles from the near wellbore to the far field. These results compare favorably with routine core analysis for porosity and with special core analysis for saturation height modeling, which indicates a significant improvement over traditional log analysis for key intervals. Effective medium models suitable for complex mineralogy and porosity types found in these frontier areas were studied and applied within the multisensor inversion workflow in conjunction with Gassmann fluid substitution to evaluate light hydrocarbon effects on the elastic properties of the formation. The results demonstrate an efficient and accurate inversion workflow that can complement traditional formation evaluation in challenging conditions.|","Document Type

"849","2015-WWWW","New Models for Acoustic Anisotropic Interpretation in Shale","Murphy, Eric, Chesapeake| Barraza, Saul Rivera, Chesapeake| Gu, Ming, Halliburton| Gokaraju, Deepak, Halliburton| Far, Mehdi E., Halliburton| Quirein, John, Halliburton","|Abstract
Fully characterizing the geomechanical properties of a vertically transverse anisotropic rock, such as shale, requires five independent stiffness coefficients: C33, C44, C66, C11, and C13. In a vertical well, C33 and C44 are calculated from the velocity of the vertically propagating P- and S- waves; C66 is estimated from the Stoneley wave velocity. An empirical model must be used to obtain C11 and C13. One widely-used anisotropic model is the ANNIE model (Schoenberg et al. 1996). ANNIE obtains the other two coefficients by setting the Thomsen parameter <U+03B4> to zero and assuming C13= C12. Recently, Quirein et al. (2014) modified ANNIE by using new empirical correlations to reduce the prediction bias of C11 and C13 (M-ANNIE 1). Both models, however, require the Stoneley wave velocity as input, which prevents their applicability in the conditions of cased-hole or logging without the dipole sonic tools.
In this paper, two new anisotropic models are introduced: the velocity regression model (V-reg) and the further modified ANNIE (M-ANNIE 2). The basis of V-reg is the observed near-linear relationships among measured 0, 45, and 90&$1976; P- and S- wave velocities from the ultrasonic shale core data from the published data set and the laboratory. MANNIE 2, based on M-ANNIE 1, uses a new constraint of the linear relationship between the Thomsen P- and S- wave anisotropy parameters (<U+03B5>=k*<U+03B3>) to replace the Stoneley wave constraint to predicting C66.
By applying the two new models to the published core data of multiple organic shales from all over the world, their predictive power for the stiffness coefficients, elastic moduli, and closure stress are evaluated. Generally, the new models provide as good predictions as the M-ANNIE 1 and better predictions than the ANNIE and isotropic model. They also provide good estimates for C66, with a small bias of approximately 1%. They yield higher predictions for the Young’s modulus and closure stress and reduce the underestimation bias of the ANNIE and isotropic model. A sensitivity analysis shows that for the V-reg model, the 45° P- wave velocity has the largest impact on the predictions. Finally, the log examples show that the two new models yield predictions consistent with the Stoneley wave methods, such as M-ANNIE 1. For some intervals with problematic Stoneley wave data, the new models yield better predictions than the Stoneley wave methods. Both new models, without the Stoneley wave velocity as an input, show significant potential in the conditions that the Stoneley wave is missing. They could also be used as a quality-check model to validate results interpreted by ANNIE or MANNIE for conditions which the Stoneley wave can be measured but its uncertainty is high.|","Document Type

The Kinabalu field, located offshore East Malaysia and operated by Talisman, is presently in a phase of rejuvenation with multiple deviated infill wells drilled from the same platform. Inclinations range from about 30° to 60° and trajectories are along main fault. Some of the reservoirs in the field show signs of depletion due to previous production. These reservoir sands were found prone to sanding. This is evidenced from the early producing wells that have been producing sands at surface.
With the current well completions, the operator is constrained to produce the field at economic rates. Uncertainties associated with sand failure are constraining them from implementing a more efficient completion design capable of delivering the required production. To make a decision for an alternative completion, geomechanical risks associated to formation stresses and rock strength need to be addressed as the reservoir conditions have changed from initial pre-production conditions. An alternative completion strategy such as perforated cemented liner was considered as it would deliver higher production rates with significantly reduced cost, however there were risks associated. Due to lack of data and confidence, uncertainties in rock strength and stress characterization with regard to faulting and historical production were to be reduced; emphasis on measurements was needed. Objectives were to quantify rock strength and stress anisotropy to improve the reservoir characterization while minimizing assumptions and analogue field experience.
To meet both geomechanical characterization and near-wellbore integrity evaluation objectives, the operator decided to acquire advanced wireline sonic and image tools. The advanced sonic processing provides azimuthal dipole measurements, shear anisotropy, slowness radial profiling and horizontal stress magnitudes. As technical difficulty arises in single-well data interpretation of borehole failure and acoustics, principally because of high inclination of the considered wells, a multi-well approach with advanced acoustics and image interpretations was proposed to overcome these limitations. The maximum stress direction was found more oblique to the fault than initially anticipated and the horizontal stress anisotropy was found to be higher that initially assumed. Most of the reservoir sands exhibit stress-sensitivity and near wellbore alteration. These together constrain the perforation and coring strategies in the final well of the rejuvenation drilling campaign. The sensitivity of sand failure and critical drawdown pressure to stresses and perforation design could then be better assessed.
Given a development strategy with high angle wells and a pressing need to pin parameters down to improve sand failure prediction, acquiring monopole and dipole sonic in stress sensitive formations together with borehole image prove to be an important piece of information. The integrated stress analysis provides valuable information regarding the field stress state. It also provides information on location, extension and orientation of near wellbore alteration. Both play critical roles in sanding management and completion design. The operator integrated this information in their geomechanical model to mitigate sanding risk and optimized their completion strategy. The near wellbore alteration assessment complements the change of perforation design to lower density and deeper penetration. As a result, the operator increased production with faster clean up in the final well of the campaign.|","Document Type

The estimation of continuous downhole permeability is widely performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) using the classical approaches of Seevers-Kenyon and Timur-Coates. The first approach uses an average of the relaxation times, whereas the latter approach is based on the fractional fluid content computed from a relaxation time distribution cutoff. However, several case studies in the literature reported that these estimators might fail when applied to carbonate rocks in which permeability is often less correlated to porosity, irreducible water content and relaxation times. Furthermore, carbonate rocks may have more complex pore body and throat size distributions (e.g., bimodal distributions) that may be poorly described by a single parameter of the NMR distribution (i.e., the average or the cutoff).
This study develops an estimator that uses multiple NMR distribution bins, representing a general case of the classical estimators. This multivariate approach evaluates the size information encoded in each relaxation time bin to estimate permeability. The multivariate estimators are calibrated with absolute permeability using principal component regression (PCR), whereas classical estimators uses standard multiple linear regression. PCR reliably describes relaxation time distributions in a simple and linear-independent manner according to data variance and is a potentially suitable tool for this multivariate calibration task. The performance of the classical and multivariate estimators are compared after undergoing full cross-validation.
An important feature of the novel multivariate approach is the possibility of simultaneously using longitudinal (T1 ) and transverse (T2) relaxation times or simply using a specific segment of the T1, 2distribution. Both situations could be highly useful for well logging because NMR activations can either simultaneously acquire complete T1and T2data or can emphasize certain components (e.g., the irreducible fluid signal). Moreover, the multivariate estimators can also be applied to size-scaled T1, 2distributions for cases in which relaxation times are less sensitive to permeability, which may occur in many carbonates. By employing mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) data for NMR size scaling, permeability estimates are improved considerably compared to the non-scaled estimates. The superior results achieved with the novel multivariate estimators over the classical estimators indicate that NMR well logging data should be further explored to improve the accuracy of permeability estimates. |","Document Type

Acoustic anisotropy analysis is used in a wide variety of applications, such as fracture characterisation, wellbore stability, production enhancement, and geosteering. However, the methods by which acoustic anisotropy are determined are not always well understood, both by the end user and the data analyst. Azimuthal variations in velocities may be due to stress variations, intrinsic anisotropy, bed boundaries, or some combination thereof. Environmental effects such as hole inclination, centralization, wellbore condition, dispersion and source/receiver matching affect the viability of the data and must be considered in the interpretation. Untangling the various acoustic anisotropy factors is essential to effectively interpreting the results.
This paper begins with a discussion of the types of acoustic anisotropy, followed by a review of common industry methods for extracting anisotropy from wireline and LWD azimuthal sonic data. Environmental factors such as tool centralization, irregular borehole shape, poor tool calibration, and dispersion are considered, paying particular attention to the practical limitations of acquiring data suitable for high quality anisotropy analysis in adverse conditions.
Quality control techniques are discussed in some detail, as there are various causes of “false anisotropy” that should be recognized so as not to incorrectly interpret processing artefacts as formation features. Quality control plots are suggested to aid the non-specialist in determining whether the anisotropy results are viable.
Intrinsic, induced, and geometric anisotropy are discussed in detail, along with consideration of the depth if sensitivity of acoustic measurements. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the art of untangling overlapping acoustic anisotropy responses. |","Document Type

However, the evaluation of rock mechanical properties in these formations is challenging because of their heterogeneity, anisotropy, and complex lithology. Hence, geomechanical analysis should include a complete definition of the anisotropic elastic stiffness coefficients for stress prediction. Furthermore, typical assumptions made for poroelastic parameters (e.g., Biot’s coefficient equal to one) can result in unreliable geomechanical evaluation for stress prediction. Unreliable stress prediction can further lead to unexpected fracture propagation, failure in proppant placement, and, ultimately, unsuccessful selection of completion intervals. The objectives of this paper include (a) measuring anisotropic elastic properties and poroelastic parameters in organic-rich mudrocks and (b) predicting minimum horizontal stresses for organic-rich mudrocks, using laboratory measurements and well logs. We then investigate the impact of anisotropic elastic and poroelastic rock properties on stress prediction. |We first perform triaxial stress and uniaxial strain mechanical tests on core plugs from the Haynesville, upper Wolfcamp and lower Eagle Ford shale formations. We obtained correlations between the dynamic and static elastic stiffness coefficients, based on laboratory experiments. We then used well logs to estimate the petrophysical/compositional properties as well as the dynamic elastic stiffness coefficients of the formations. The estimates of mineral composition are used in conjunction with the estimates of elastic stiffness coefficients to obtain anisotropic poroelastic parameters. Finally, stress prediction was performed under the assumption of transverse isotropy, which included the measured anisotropic elastic and poroelastic parameters. We evaluated the impact of anisotropic mechanical properties on stress prediction in the lower Eagle Ford, Haynesville, and upper Wolfcamp shale formations, with different levels of mechanical anisotropy and vertical heterogeneity. The results show that Biot’s coefficient of poroelasticity is not equal to one. Therefore, depth-bydepth estimation of anisotropic poroelastic coefficients are required for transversely isotropic media for accurate stress prediction. The estimated minimum horizontal stress gradient assuming anisotropic elastic properties and anisotropic poroelastic parameters, varies by about 40% compared to the case where these parameters are assumed to be equal to one. We also showed that integrated interpretation of petrophysical, compositional, and mechanical properties is important for geomechanical evaluation in organic-rich mudrocks.|","Document Type

Waterflooding is a proven secondary recovery mechanism for hydrocarbon production while maintaining reservoir pressures. To achieve the desired voidage replacement ratio, each injector well is designed to inject at a certain rate to support its paired producer. From a safety perspective, it is essential to avoid 1) injection above shale fracture pressure that could result in top seal failure and 2) injection above fault propagation pressure that could result in fault reactivation/propagation. The potential consequences of these hazards are out of zone injection or loss of containment. Following recent major oil spill incidents around the world (e.g. Macondo disaster in the Gulf of Mexico), regulations have become more stringent on well designs pertaining to wellbore stability and reservoir geomechanics. 
This paper will showcase an integrated effort at assessing the injection pressure margin and the impact on the detailed injector well designs for a deepwater turbidite field development in the Gulf of Guinea (Nigeria). The technique applied requires a good understanding of the fracture pressures, rock strength, failure mechanism and good drilling and completion practices. To test different scenarios, one well injecting to a deep reservoir and another well injecting to a shallow reservoir were selected for this assessment. Pore pressure, fracture pressure, and injection pressure along the wellbore were analyzed to ascertain the margin between the downhole injection pressure and fracture pressures above and at the proposed casing shoe setting depths.  The results of this study provided basis for injector well designs, justification for full field geomechanics modeling, and recommendations for data acquisition while drilling and well reservoir monitoring throughout the injection/production period.|",""

Depletion and injection induced pore pressure changes will be accompanied by total stress changes in the reservoir and around faults which can cause fracture formation or fault activation that may result in fluid migration outside the reservoir. 3D geomechanical assessment of the Deep Water Turbidite (DWT field), located in the southern part of the Niger Delta in offshore Nigeria, was performed in line with subsurface process safety requirements, to determine the sealing integrity of the top seal and the likelihood of the major faults to slip under depletion/injection induced pore pressure changes during the production life of the field. The analysis was carried out using a proprietary Finite Element tool, based on TNO-Diana Finite Elements. A subsequent sensitivity study was performed to account for uncertainties in some of the material parameters used for the assessment. 
This paper presents the workflow and outcome of the geomechanical assessment carried out for the DWT field. Model results indicate that faults do not get triggered unless injection pressures can access the entire interval of the fault slip zone, including overburden and underburden sections. Analysis of planned injection pressures in the shallowest layers indicates a potential for hydrofracturing the shale caprock. A mitigation plan is currently being designed to address the issue.|",""

Borehole instability challenges can account for a significant percentage of non-productive time and associated costs in drilling. This is even more so in deepwater subsea wells due to high development costs coupled with the subsurface complexities associated with turbidite reservoirs. Pre-drill borehole stability studies in this field case were performed by evaluating offset well history and geophysical log data and calibrating these against direct well measurements and drilling experiences, with the objective of recommending the appropriate mud weight. However, the validation of the pre-drill borehole stability model derived from sonic data taken in the only offset well in the field was deemed necessary for effective borehole stability monitoring in this case. Additionally, the inability to run wireline in a highly deviated well fuelled the need for acoustic data acquisition using logging-while-drilling (LWD). Sonic data was acquired by LWD (a first in the field) and this aided mud weight optimization to successfully drill the well to TD without any borehole stability problems.

Waterflooding is a proven method for improving offtake rate and ultimate recovery from conventional-oil reservoirs. Although relatively simple and inexpensive to operate, the dynamics and eventual performance of waterflooded reservoirs are controlled by complex interactions of several factors. Due to this complexity, it has been difficult to develop a robust, consistent and yet simple normalizing parameter for comparing the performances and recoveries of different reservoirs under waterflood. As they are generally empirical, most of the existing analogue techniques are not internally consistent and, under certain conditions, yield non-physical results. The inconsistencies in the analogue techniques are a major challenge in the industry. 
This paper reviews common analogue techniques, highlighting their relative strengths and weaknesses. Employing a combination of analytic formulation and numerical simulations, a new aggregate parameter is introduced for characterizing waterflood reservoirs. In addressing the limitations of existing approaches, the new parameter incorporates the key subsurface and operating factors, including well count and reservoir-compartmentalization, which control reservoir performance. 
Although developed for waterfloods, the parameter accounts for depletion drive; often the main drive mechanism in cases of delayed as well as inadequate injection. Despite its robustness, the proposed parametric expression remains compact and auditable, while offering a good basis for interdisciplinary discussions and gaining relevant insights. 
Using a deepwater turbidite oilfield in West Africa as a case study, applicability of the new aggregate parameter is demonstrated. In this five-reservoir application, the most suitable analogue among the set of reservoirs is identified. Subsequent reservoir-simulation studies affirm the suitability of the recommended analogue and the aggregate parameter. 
In practice, the proposed parameter should find applications in establishing analogy for reserves booking, preliminary evaluation of mature waterfloods, sense-checking reservoir-simulation results, and providing insights into realistic reservoir-scale recovery factor. In addition, it is a promising quantity for screening between enhanced-oil and improved-oil recovery opportunities in mature waterfloods.|",""

Thanks to predecessor's researches, several reserve estimation methods have been proposed over the last few decades, which are commonly accurate for conventional reservoir. However, for stress-sensitive reservoir, permeability is the function of pressure, which may lead to significant errors when using traditional methods even though the flow is boundary-dominated. 
In this paper, errors caused by applying several traditional reserve estimation methods based on production data including Flowing Material Balance, Normalized Rate – Cumulative Curved in stress-sensitive reservoir are quantified with numerical simulation. Then, based on the sensitive-analysis, modification procedures for these traditional methods are proposed and validated with synthetic data. Finally, the modified methods are applied to Sulige gas field, a typical stress-sensitive tight gas reservoir. 
It can be concluded from the error analysis that for stress-sensitive gas reservoir, Flowing Material Balance and Normalized Rat-Cumulative Curve would result in underestimation. For all the methods above, the magnitude of error is influenced by formation properties, hydraulic fracture qualities, operation conditions and the level of stress-sensitivity. Besides, the error caused by the latter method is larger than that caused by flowing material balance for the same condition. We also find that Flowing Material Balance and Normalized Rate–Cumulative Curve can be modified by introducing new pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time, which take stress-sensitivity into account. These methods are proved to be accurate by both numerical simulated data and field data. 
The technique contributions of this paper including: (1) the error caused by stress-sensitivity for traditional reserve estimation methods are quantified and the influencing factors are investigated; (2) modified ideals for traditional methods are proposed.|","Document Type

Wellbore instability all over the world accounts for a significant in Non-Productive Time (NPT) in well drilling and completions and incurring high cost of drilling as well as increasing safe risks.

Numerous wellbore instability problems related to drilling through potentially natural fractured reservoirs/formations have been reported.

This research work outlines the main results of the shale instability study with respect to shale/ fluid interaction mechanisms, and also analyses the shale strength properties. An approach was undertaken to develop a better understanding of the effects of using polymer drilling fluid on the shale mechanical properties and how to optimize its performance. Wellbore stability in shale is very much influenced by the type of drilling fluid used, here the problems observed were, borehole fluid invasion into the shale, increase in potential pipe sticking, swelling/hydration of shale which results in high level of non-production time (NPT). Different drilling fluids were analyzed for their effects on shale strength. Emphasis here was on the mechanical properties of the shale samples after exposed to different drilling fluids for 24hours. The mud which maintains high compressive strength of the shale is the most preferred (optimum) selection. The shale sample exposed to the polymer drilling fluid shows the lowest strength, from the stress-strain curve. The use of KCl brine in drilling fluids is based on its shale inhibition characteristics as it is thought that the k+ ion provides additional attraction among the clay platelets due to its size and charge. However the shale loses most part of its strength when exposed to the modified polymer drilling muds combined with 5% KCl, 7%, 10% KCl respectively. One of the possible reasons is Kaolinite in the shale. The shale samples will keep more of its original strength when exposed to the modified polymer drilling muds combined with chemical agents with plugging ability to pore throat and micro-fracture. The shale sample exposed to polymer drilling fluid with 10%Nacl, 5% Physical sealing agent and 10% Chemical agent A1 (rich in silica) exhibit the highest strength. From the result of the experiment the drilling fluid density has been reduced immensely, thus the new mud system improves the wellbore stability and keeps the shale formation stable.|",""

Bedding plane is a surface that separates one stratum, layer, or bed of stratified rock from another and represents interruptions in the course of deposition of the rock mass. A number of models have been proposed in the attempt to solving the problem of wellbore instabilities due to weak bedding plane. Some of these models are developed to be used at the planning and design stages of the well while the accuracy and efficiency depend largely on the integrity of pre-drill data. The objective of this paper is to provide an integrated 3D+ geo-mechanical model that would help reduce non productive time (NPT) by combining minimum drilling conditions across weak bedding plane, time dependent brittle creep of rocks and optimum hydraulics parameters. The new model assumes anisotropy rock strength criteria in order to develop theory and models to predict rock physical behavior under specific load conditions. Also all in-situ stresses were assumed principal and directed horizontally and vertically. Analyses were achieved with the aid of DrillMax software newly developed and the results validated with Opti-Well software currently in use for the Niger-Delta Field. The intermediate hole section between 8000ft-12500ft of well-1 in the field was investigated. Analysis of the normal compaction trend showed that the well encountered abnormal pressure at the depth of (8500-11500ft). The sensitivity analysis of the field data showed that the overburden pressure lied within the range 16.84- 17.92ppg while pore pressure was between 9.86- 10.91ppg. The fracture pressure was between 12.84- 13.95ppg while the collapse pressure was 10.92-11.68ppg equivalent mud weight. From the analysis of the hydraulics parameters, the pressure drop at the bit was estimated to be 1894Psi.

Reservoirs in the Niger Delta oil province are predominantly weak sandstones and unconsolidated sands of the Agbada formation. Wells in these reservoirs are susceptible to sand production as production entails high water cut. Sand production is triggered by mechanical failure near the wellbore and occurs when the near-well deformation process changes. The deformation process is controlled by parameters such as production rate, drawdown, reservoir pressure changes and reservoir formation properties. Mechanical failure of the reservoir leads to the mobilisation of failed material and changes the near wellbore porosity and permeability of the rock. 
The Chestnut Field operated by Centrica Energy and partners (block 22/2a, Central North Sea, UK sector) has been under production since 2008 despite continuous sand production. The reservoir consists of unconsolidated sand with a porosity average above 30% and permeability of 0.5 to 2 Darcy similar to many Niger Delta sand reservoirs. This paper introduces the Sand Production and Pore Pressure Management Program which was implemented to control sand production and maintain hydrocarbon production. Additionally, an analysis of near wellbore porosity and permeability changes is presented. 
Real-time data acquired from four wells over a period of more than four years and the production of over 140 tons of sand were utilised. The results indicate a change in porosity and permeability which is consistent with a change from compaction to dilatancy conditions near the wellbore. These changes have had a significant impact on the sand management strategy implemented to optimise the production through the field life to date.|",""

Formation strength is an important parameter in drilling operations pressure control because it indicates the wellbore pressure containment envelope above which fracture or rock matrix failure starts to occur and propagate if the pressure/stress is sustained. The rock mineralogy, the orientation of wellbore with respect to the direction of regional fault line, the stress regime as well as the permeability of the rock determines the manner in which the rock would fracture. During well operations, situations that may result in the fracture of one of the formations traversed by the wellbore could arise, in which case, the main operations focus shifts to ensuring that the fractured formation is repaired before normal well operations can resume. One of the techniques of reinforcing or repairing a fractured formation is Wellbore Strengthening; which employs a variety of technologies such as deployment of resins and specially designed cement slurry. 
Over the years squeeze cementing success has greatly improved through studies and using best practices; however, wellbore strengthening through squeeze cementing still poses unique challenges of determining the location of the fractures that need sealing; and also whether these fractures are compatible with the designed cement slurry. Thus squeeze cementing, while being economical and effective, will only succeed if the job is properly designed and executed. 
This paper will demonstrate, through actual results, the feasibility of squeeze cementing as a means to restore wellbore strength by explaining the basic engineering that goes into designing a successful squeeze cement job for this purpose. It focuses on describing how the multidisciplinary approach of rock geo-mechanics, lithology, fluid mechanics, cement slurry design and proper job execution can contribute to the success of wellbore strengthening through squeeze cementing.|","Document Type

Development options in marginal fields are sometimes limited, driven primarily by economics, license period, size of asset and regulatory constraints. The Operators objective is to economically develop the reserves from multiple zones with fewer wells, whilst maintaining mandatory reservoir surveillance and accounting. Intelligent or smart completions are at various level of maturity, depending on the well architecture, application, and measurement & control devices. The concept of using smart completions within the marginal field environment has historically been limited. 
The conventional completion practices in marginal fields with stacked reservoirs are mostly multistring or selective designs. A strong driver for smart wells in a marginal field is the desire for simultaneous exploitation of multiple reservoirs, lower capex (fewer wells), reduced opex, smaller footprints and effective zonal control. Remote zonal control is desirable, due to the locations accessibility, which makes intervention prohibitive and with increased health, safety, and environmental (HSE) risks. 
This paper will focus on the application of an intelligent completion technique in Okporhuru, a partially appraised field in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria comprising stacked reservoirs. The field is classified marginal due to limited data, low first pass initial oil volume and remoteness from production facilities, amongst others. This paper will detail the modelling technique, flow control valve (FCV) design philosophy, and requisite monitoring to meet target zonal flow contributions. Application of a compact, modular, multi-zonal smart completion solution (IZC), pre installation design, deployment considerations and production allocation methodology will highlight the considerations for selection of a unique sand control technique in this partially appraised field.|","Document Type

Structural discontinuity implies the presence of faults and fractures that have significant control on fluid communication within the subsurface. The Yowi field has experienced drastic decline in oil production just after two years of commencement of production. Possible factors responsible for this problem can be attributed to both geologic and engineering uncertainties. An integrated approach was adopted by first identifying geological factors and consequently validating its results with production behaviour. Results of the study revealed that the presence of network of fractures and the homogeneity of facies unit would have contributed to significant coning and early water breakthrough beside the poor reservoir management. Well log motif of the N5.2 sand displays a blocky shape, having a gradational upper contact and a sharp lower boundary. This indicates channel sand likely deposited within the beach environment. The sand-body shows high net-to-gross ratio, low volume of shale and excellent porosity and permeability values. Five CT-scanned core sample plugs also show the presence of massive regular and systematically formed vertical fractures. Fracture network presented a naturally fractured reservoir condition which accounted for significant coning due to high vertical permeability resulting in lowering the critical rate and more rapid breakthrough time. These fractures appear to be induced by both regional stress and the high drilling density on the subsurface structure in the field. This finding provides a more predictive insight into coning behaviour and a blueprint for post-breakthrough performance analysis.|",""

Injection of water into a poorly cemented granular medium may lead to internal erosion, and consequently formation preferential flow paths within the medium because of channelization. Channelization in the porous medium might occur when fluid-induced stresses become locally larger than a critical threshold and small grains are dislodged and carried away; hence, porosity and permeability of the medium will evolve along the induced flow paths. Vice versa, flowback during shut-in might carry particles back to the well and cause sand accumulation inside the well, and subsequently loss of injectivity. In most cases, to maintain the injection rate, operators will increase injection pressure and pumping power. The increased injection pressure results in stress changes and possibly further changes in channel patterns around the wellbore. Experimental laboratory studies have confirmed the presence of the transition from uniform Darcy flow to a fingered-pattern flow. To predict these phenomena, a model is needed to fill this gap by predicting the formation of preferential flow paths and their evolution. A model based on the multiphase-volume-fraction concept is used to decompose porosity into mobile and immobile porosities where phases may change spatially, evolve over time, and lead to development of erosional channels depending on injection rates, viscosity, and rock properties. This model will account for both particle release and suspension deposition. By use of this model, a methodology is proposed to derive model parameters from routine injection tests by inverse analysis. The proposed model presents the characteristic behavior of unconsolidated formation during fluid injection and the possible effect of injection parameters on downhole-permeability evolution.|","loss of injectivity, unconsolidated sands, water injectors"

A multistage hydraulic-fracturing strategy is often used to help maximize the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). The current analysis is based on chaining the stage results one-by-one. At each stage, the 3D SRV is constructed on the basis of its observed microseismic events with an enhanced convex-hull approach. This algorithm offers both a mathematical approximation of 3D volume and a 3D visualization of the SRV geophysical shape(s). More-detailed geometric characteristics are calculated further from the ellipsoid that best fits the constructed SRV, which relies on the acquired microseismic events. The characteristics include length, width, height, and orientation azimuth of the stimulated rock. Moreover, it forms the basis for calculating the overall SRV with the stage-by-stage approach. |In the advanced phase, this algorithm offers characteristics related to the interaction between multiple stages. The accurate 3D geophysical geometry of the overlapping volume between multiple stages is extracted and is calculated, and the percentage of overlapping volume over the SRV is estimated at each stage. These volume-overlapping quantities reveal the potential communication between these stages, indicating the efficiency of hydraulic-fracturing efforts and implying the loss of treatment fluid. This algorithm provides the field engineers with several useful aspects: an essential, reliable, and direct compound tool to dynamically visualize the stimulated reservoir geometry and treatment-field evolution; a real-time evaluation of the efficiency of a hydraulic-fracturing treatment; and parameters to help increase the production of a stimulated reservoir.|","stimulated reservoir, SRV, Microseismics"

These properties are evaluated by combining different field measurement techniques (wireline logs, results of well tests, seismic surveys) and laboratory-test results (Archie 1942, 1950; Serra 1986; Bassiouni 1994). When cores are available, empirical models are built from correlations derived between well logs and laboratory measurements to estimate rock properties in noncored wells. The validity of these empirical models is often limited to specific lithofacies (see reviews by Chang et al. 2006; Blasingame 2008; Khaksar et al. 2009), which makes the identification of lithofacies a necessity before applying the model for predictions in uncored wells (Massonnat 1999). Because of the heterogeneity of rocks (Haldorsen 1996), with characteristic length scales commonly smaller than the resolution of wireline logs or even the core-plug size, the robustness of correlations is determined by how plug samples capture the dispersion in rock properties over the lithofacies under consideration. The correlation between a very localized core-plug measurement and a low-resolution wireline log with inherent low-pass filtering properties raises issues related to the upscaling of a property from one length scale (few centimeters for core plugs) to another (up to 1 m for wireline log). As an illustration, consider the high-resolution, continuous profile X, where the variations of the measured property are quantified for length scales smaller than typical plug sizes. We filter this data to produce the profiles X5 and X50 (the subscript stands for the length scale in centimeters at which the signal is averaged out) with lower spatial resolutions similar to the plug and the well-log resolutions, respectively (Fig. 1). The resulting crossplot, shown in Fig. 2, of X5 vs. X50 exhibits a cloud of points in which the dispersion is governed by the properties of the signal (the degree of heterogeneity or the frequency content) and the difference between the two resolution length scales. Two linear-fit optimizations were carried out with the lowresolution-data X50 and the high-resolution-data X5 as the dependent variables, respectively. It is interesting to note that these linear fits yield different results, with a slope of 0.96 in the first case and 0.69 in the second case. This is a mathematical artifact caused by the minimization process inherent in the search for the best linear fit, which is most commonly a minimization of the vertical distance between the representative data points and the best-fit line. On the basis of this result, it should always be advisable to select the high-resolution data (plug) as the dependent variable. Discrete sampling (i.e., plugging) and the dispersion caused by the difference in resolution scales of two measurements are two important root causes of the errors often seen in correlations between two variables. The examples shown in Fig. 2 illustrate how the correlations derived from several sampling schemes can deviate from the expected one-to-one relation between the two variables. To circumvent these issues, petrophysicists usually select large quantities of plugs to build representative statistical data sets, with the hope that they are large enough to attenuate the effects listed previously.|","scratch strength, high resolution continuous log, scaling"

A category of mass sediment transport in certain river and coastal settings is that of ‘retrogressive breach failure’ (RBF). Sand is carried away in a turbulent density current generated by the momentum of sand grains cascading off the face of a retrogressing, subaqueous near vertical wall of sand called a ‘breach’. If such events retrogress onto the shoreline, they can cause serious damage to beaches, banks and manmade erosion defences. While a greatdeal of research effort has been applied to understanding the geotechnical nature of such events, particularly in the United States and the Netherlands, we have found that this mechanism of sediment transport is generally not well known to coastal scientists and engineers in Australia. This paper describes a site at Amity Point in Eastern Australia where successive RBF events have played a major role in coastal recession. Measures taken to stabilise the coast are described. The site serves as an unusual case study in coastal management.|","density current, Retrogressive breach,  sediment transport,  seawall  stability,  dilation,  erosion,  channel slumping."

Dynamic compaction is known as one of the most cost-effective soil improvement techniques. In this method the soil at the ground surface or at a relatively deep depth is compacted by repeatedly dropping heavy weights on the ground. Since its introduction, dynamic compaction has exhibited its versatility and simplicity of use in different types of civil engineering projects, including building structures, container terminals, highways, airports, dockyards, and harbours. However, despite the abundance of experimental data and field observation reports, few numerical approaches have been established in the literature to effectively deal with soil behaviour under dynamic compaction. This is mainly due to the dependence of soil dynamic response on variations in the moisture content. Therefore, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of dynamic compaction the soil should be modelled as a three-phase porous medium. The presence of a non-wetting and a wetting phase, together with the existence of inertia forces in each phase, makes the solution of the coupled dynamic system computationally demanding. Moreover, large deformations often take place during dynamic compaction; hence the infinitesimal strain theory cannot be employed for higher impact loads. In this paper a finite element approach is introduced to numerically simulate the problem of dynamic compaction under the framework of unsaturated soil mechanics. The governing equations are derived based upon the overall momentum balance of the mixture, the mass balance of the liquid phase, and the mass balance of the gas phase. Phase changes and chemical reactions are not considered. Among other important parameters, the effect of the degree of saturation on the soil response will be addressed.|","Dynamic compaction,  Finite element,  Porous media,  Mixture theory,  Unsaturated soil"

The dynamic penetration of anchors into the seabed is an important problem in offshore geomechanics and one of the most challenging for geotechnical analysts. Complications due to the nonlinear material response of the soil, the large deformations caused by the insertion of the object, and the changing boundary conditions at the contact between the soil and the anchors must be taken into account. Moreover, the presence of a pore fluid, and the pressure that it may exert, requires a fully coupled displacement-pore pressure analysis. Recent work has facilitated the modelling of the dynamic penetration of objects into soil. The finite element method is one of the most commonly used techniques for tackling problems of soil penetration because the resulting solutions satisfy the equation of dynamic equilibrium and the method can incorporate sophisticated soil models as well as complex boundary conditions. This study discusses a number of challenging aspects of the numerical simulation of dynamically embedded anchors, particularly torpedo anchors, and presents a robust analysis strategy for such problems. This technique is based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method and rigorously incorporates displacements, velocities, and accelerations of the solid phase along with the pore pressure and velocities of the fluid phase. |","Torpedo anchors,  Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Method,  dynamic penetration"

More and more natural slopes are reshaped into cut slopes nowadays and these slopes are prone to landslides. To properly use the land near cut slopes, a method to evaluate the travel distance of cut slope landslides is necessary. This paper firstly reports on the use of SPH method for the simulation of the Fei Tsui landslide, Hong Kong. Then, the influence of geometry of cut slopes is investigated. It is concluded that the soil friction and pore pressure parameters are important in the evaluation of the landslide travel distance. For landslide deposit residing completely at the toe, the volume, slope angle and source angle are important factors for the prediction of travel distance. Conversely, the landslide height and the shape of the landslide mass are insignificant.

A mobile jackup is an important facility in offshore oil and gas development and often works in close proximity to a permanent jacket platform. The unique operation method and foundation tip (spudcan) configurations of jackups have induced a number of geotechnical challenges. Among them, an important issue is that the spudcan will displace a large volume of soil during penetration and may induce severe stresses on adjacent piles supporting the jacket platform. Though having general principals, the current industry code does not provide detailed guidance that engineers can follow specifically in practice to quantify this effect. Thus, a practical approach was developed in this paper in which the complicated phenomenon was numerically solved in two steps: Firstly, the soil displacement of free field around the spudcan was numerically studied using the large deformation technology. The induced soil displacement was found heavily dependent on the soil deformation characteristics such as e50. Secondly, the conventional beam-column method using P-Y soil springs was adopted to compute the soil displacement induced loading on the jacket pile. On the contrary, the induced pile loading was found not sensitive to the variation of soil e50 within a reasonable range, provided that the matching P-Y curves to the soil displacement in free field are used in the sequential analysis. The above approach was validated by centrifugal experiment results published in the past. In addition, the paper discussed how to set up an appropriate boundary condition at the pile head where the pile is connected with the jacket structures, and how to combine the spudcan induced loading with the upstructural loading to determine the ultimate status of a jacket pile. Both items have been neglected in the past study but may have profound effect on the final results. |","Tracer Particle,  Soil Displacement,  Clay,  Numerical Simulation,  Beam-Column Analysis.,  ALE, Spudcan"

This paper describes the development of a new efficient semi-analytical method, namely scaled boundary finite-element method (SBFEM) for the analysis of sloshing in axi-symmetric vessels based on multimodal analysis, and the governing Laplace equations and linear free surface boundary condition are also applied to the proposed model. A two dimensional eigenvalue problem is obtained by using the scaled boundary finite element method for zero external excitation, which is solved through a variational (Garlerkin) formulation that uses three node finite elements by only discreting the boundary of the water surface and walls, then the dimension of the problem is reduced by one. Subsequently, based on an appropriate decomposition of the container fluid motion, and considering the eigenmodes of the corresponding eigenvalue problem, an efficient methodology is proposed for externally-induced sloshing, through the calculation of the corresponding sloshing (or convective) masses. Numerical results are obtained for sloshing frequencies and masses in spherical vessels and a conical vessel, and the dynamic response of the sloshing is also obtained under different seismic waves. The numerical results are in very good comparison with other analytical or numerical solutions.|","Multimodal analysis, Scaled boundary finite element method,  Liquid sloshing,  Axi-symmetric vessels,  Eigenvalue"

Estimation of bearing capacity is critical in the design of skirted foundations. Empirical formula and closed form solutions for skirted foundations in uniform profiles composed of sand or clay have been proposed. However, the capacity of foundations in alternating layers of sand and clay is not well defined. We perform a series of threedimensional elasto-plastic finite element analyses on such profiles and calculate the bearing capacity of skirted foundations. It is shown that assuming a uniform profile is not appropriate. Even a thin layer of clay below the tip of the skirted foundation can significantly reduce the capacity of the foundation.

Details of a three-dimensional finite element modeling on the basis of the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian method for simulation on installation of suction anchors are presented in this paper. Generally in a process of the design practice of suction anchors, a classical finite element method has been widely used to predict a stress-strain behavior of the soils both inside and outside the suction anchors. But the classical finite element method often leads to contact boundary problems on between the soils and the suction anchors, in particular, when simulating on installation of the suction anchors penetrated into the clay which large deformation occurs. Whereas a finite element analysis based on the CEL method is well suitable of solving geotechnical contact problems including large deformation of the interface between the clay and the suction anchors. A series of three dimensional finite element analyses based on the CEL on suction anchors with ratios of 1:1 to 1:6 (diameter versus penetration depth) were performed and simulated on installation of the suction anchors into the clay. A stress-strain behavior of the clay both inside and outside the suction anchors under installation was investigated. The CEL predictions were compared with the design predictions on skirt penetration resistance load by DNV (2005). The CEL predictions gave a correlation with the design predictions within 20% errors. The results indicated that the CEL simulation on installation of suction anchors can reasonably provide good predictions.|","finite element analysis,  skirt penetration resistance load,  Coupled Eulerian- Lagrangian (CEL) method,  installation, suction anchors"

Advancements in drilling technology and practices have led to improvements in drilling efficiency and increases in the lateral length of high-angle (HA) and horizontal (HZ) wells. Commensurate with increased lateral length is an increase in stage count, adding completion cost without always realizing significant additional production revenue. A traditional approach to stimulation design, coupled with the above-noted factors and variable oil and gas market prices, have led to numerous marginally economic HA and HZ wells. 
Improving recovery along the extent of the lateral well is desirable to improve the economic viability of the well. During the field development phase, such an effort requires integrating interdisciplinary data and expertise that exist beyond the well-centric approach. A workflow is proposed in which multiple disciplines are integrated to optimize completion design and enhance production at the single-well scale. 
A favorable impact on production has been reported for a number of plays across the United States in which a non-geometric completion design, a single component of the previously identified workflow, was implemented. This paper similarly describes how this approach was applied to the Niobrara and other formations in the western United States and the improvement in production results is presented. Moving beyond the so-called engineered completion, we describe how additional components of the workflow are required and implemented in formations of the western United States. A layer-centric 3D geomodel, 3D mechanical earth model, and hydraulic fracture simulations are presented and used to further understand the production profile, guiding the decision-making process. Finally, we highlight areas of ongoing effort where further integration of the workflow steps is being pursued and we describe the impact such improvements may have on decisions related to enhancing production.|","Document Type

Less than half of fracturing fluid is typically recovered during flow-back operation. This study models the effects of capillarity and geomechanics on water loss in fracture-matrix system and investigates the circumstances under which this phenomenon might be beneficial or detrimental to subsequent on tight oil production. During the shut-in (soaking) and flow-back periods, fracture conductivity decreases as effective stress increases caused by imbibition. Previous works have studied geomechanical influence assuming single-phase flow, but the coupled effect of imbibition due to multiphase flow and stress-dependent fracture properties is less understood. 
A series of mechanistic simulation models are constructed to simulate multiphase flow and fluid distribution during shut-in and flow-back. Three systems: matrix, hydraulic fracture and micro fractures are explicitly represented in the computational domain. Sensitivities to wettability and multiphase flow functions (relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships) are investigated. As wettability to water increases, matrix imbibition increases. Imbibed water would help to displace hydrocarbons into nearby micro and hydraulic fractures, enhancing initial oil rate. However, fracture compacts as fluid pressure decreases. Increase in short-term oil production as a result of imbibition could be counteracted by the reduction in flow capability due to fracture closure. Therefore, the coupling of stress-dependent fracture conductivity and imbibition are studied next. Our results indicate that the fracture compaction can enhance imbibition and water loss, which in turn leads to further reduction in fracture pressure and conductivity. Spatial variability in micro-fracture properties is also modeled probabilistically to investigate whether it is possible for fracturing fluid to be trapped in the micro fractures, or conversely, the micro fractures could provide alternate pathways for fluids to access the hydraulic fracture systems. 
This work presents a quantitative study of the controlling factors of water loss due to fluid-rock properties and geomechanics. The results highlight the crucial interplay between imbibition and geomechanics in short- and long-term production performances. The results in this study would have considerable impacts on understanding and improving current industry practice on fracturing design and assessment of stimulated reservoir volume.|","Document Type

The Duvernay Formation has been an attractive unconventional play for several producers during the last few years, and the number of drilled wells in this play has been increasing rapidly. Nevertheless, drilling in this formation is usually considered a challenging practice due to the extremely high stresses and pore pressures that can be encountered. Drilling in the Duvernay and its overlying formation, the Ireton, has shown a wide variety of drilling incidents such as sloughing, tight spots, bridges and lost circulation. This paper summarizes the results of a comprehensive regional review of drilling experience for 43 Duvernay wells. In this review, the details of drilling experience for these wells were documented using a graphical approach that captures important information on the details of drilling incidents including depths and dates, along with information on mud weights and well trajectory. As an initial part of a broader regional geomechanical study of the Duvernay, these data were statistically analyzed to identify the stratigraphic and spatial variation of drilling patterns throughout the study area. The results revealed significant differences between drilling patterns in the three major active areas of the play including south (Willesden Green and Edson), central (Kaybob), and the northwest regions. In general, wells in the central region can be drilled with lower mud weights than other regions, and experience fewer drilling problems. Because pore pressure in the Duvernay Formation in this area is as high as in the other two regions, the difference in drilling experience was attributed to considerable differences in in situ stress, which appears to be related to the presence of Leduc reefs. These stress differences were confirmed by modelling and distribution of fractures in the study area.|","Document Type

This contribution describes an entirely new method for determining the neostress (present-day stress) in reservoirs using passive seismic data from surface arrays. Until now the only stress information available from passive seismic methods has been derived from the focal mechanism solutions of microearthquakes (MEQs). This method has several weaknesses:  
The P and T axes of the solution do not correspond to the maximum and minimum compressive stress axes even though they are often used as proxies. 
MEQs that are sufficiently strong and clear to determine focal mechanism solutions are relatively rare. 
Both surface and downhole microseismic methods are limited in their ability to accurately determine focal mechanism solutions. 
The method provides information on the orientations, but not magnitudes, of the three principal stresses. 
Focal mechanism solutions yield two potential fault plane solutions which are not determined uniquely. |The new method relies on analysis of the orientation, size, and seismic activity of surface segments of Tomographic Fracture ImagesSM (TFIs). TFIs are direct images of both induced fractures and natural fractures stimulated by fracking (Geiser et al, 2012; Doe et al, Lacazette et al URTeC 2013, Lacazette et al, Sicking et al, URTeC 2014). The method uses passive seismic data acquired with surface arrays. 
TFIs can be generated as tessellated surfaces. A tessellated surface is a continuous surface composed of triangles with common edges. Slip Tendency Analysis uses the orientations, areas, and cumulative seismic activities of individual triangular facets of tessellated TFIs to find the orientations and relative magnitudes of the principal stresses that best fit the properties of the population of facets. If independent stress magnitude information is available then quantitative estimates of the reservoir stresses can be determined. The method has the advantage of working with large data sets (tens of thousands to millions of facets) that are distributed across the region of the reservoir affected by a hydraulic fracture treatment. The large sample leads to robust solutions. Also, it may be possible to extend the method to map reservoir stress variations. Other important advantages of the method are that it is not dependent on determining first arrivals and is independent of fault plane orientation or MEQ location.|","Document Type

When imaging hydraulic stimulations, the industry requires alternative methods to acquire microseismic data when vertical wells are unavailable for downhole monitoring. Surface acquisition of microseismic data is one such method that can be used. This method may have lower costs in some cases when used for acquiring multiple wells on the same pad. It can also avoid impacting completions, in particular, during zipper stimulations when a downhole well is required for imaging. New processing techniques and acquisition methods in this field appear to show promising results for event detections and improved focal mechanism solutions (FMS) for fracture network classification. 
Pioneer and numerous operators have shown that recording microseismic with a star-pattern surface array has proven to be successful in the Eagle Ford Shale Formation in South Texas. For Pioneer, this acquisition was paired with monitoring from a downhole array in a nearby vertical offset well. Both methods of observation recorded the overall stimulation and found a similar maximum stress azimuth and fracture orientation, which was also obtained from an oil base micro-imager (OBMI) tool. However, differences were noted in the event counts and fracture geometries, which are dependent upon the limitations of each acquisition method. 
Acquiring microseismic data using surface arrays has proven in the past to be a challenge in the Midland Basin of West Texas. Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer) has previously used two vendors to record microseismic data in Midland and Reagan Counties using star- and patch-arrays at the surface. Both array types provided focal mechanism solutions (FMS) to help characterize the fractures and provide stimulation geometries, including average fracture length, height and azimuth. In one of these past jobs, Pioneer also acquired downhole along with the surface data. In this project, the patch- and nearby downhole-array recorded the same hydraulic stimulation and their microseismic datasets confirmed the same maximum stress azimuth. Yet, the same limitations of surface acquisition were apparent in both types of arrays, specifically the problem of very low event counts. It is suspected that the low event counts are due to energy attenuation in the shallow, high-velocity evaporites prevalent in the Midland Basin. 
In an attempt to better understand the limitations of surface arrays in the Midland Basin, Pioneer along with two surface contractors (Dawson and NanoSeis) undertook a large scale project to better quantify differences between the downhole and surface methods as well as to test acquisition systems. These companies put together a large-scale (using four times the geophones of standard surface arrays) surface patch-array test program with the purpose of mitigating the shallow attenuation effects through signal enhancement via high fold, from an increased number of geophones. In this design, each patch was augmented with an inset array of 3-component geophones. This microseismic dataset was compared to one recorded by a nearby downhole array for the same project, and a portion of these data are shown and discussed in this paper. Beyond recognizing key similarities and differences in the microseismic attributes from the downhole and surface data in the context of the related stimulation, one of the most significant contributions of this test is that the data can be decimated to determine the minimum requirements for a successful surface acquisition of microseismic data in the Midland Basin.|","Document Type

Early Permian Roseneath and Murteree organic rich shales in the Nappamerri trough of the Cooper Basin, South Australia are emerging as one of the major unconventional gas formations in Australia. The basin has been Australia's main onshore gas supply region for the past decades and possess suitable infrastructure that can easily be adapted for shale gas development. Despite its tremendous potential, existing data on the shale geomechanical characterization are limited at best. 
The purpose of this paper is to provide a preliminary insight to the Roseneath and Murteree rock mechanical properties and stimulation potential. 8 properly preserved core samples (depth: 3167.03 – 3539.94m) from two wells were subjected to laboratory testing using standard acoustic techniques and triaxial testing for shale mechanical characterization in terms of strength, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, compressibility etc. Servo-controlled triaxial apparatus was used to conduct stress-strain measurements on four samples for each formation under uniaxial loading and different confining pressure. Samples used for this study were cored with the cylindrical axis parallel, perpendicular and 45° to bedding plane. These orientations allowed us to significantly assess the formations mechanical anisotropy. 
Experimental results suggest that the rock strength and elastic properties vary significantly due to variation of sample material composition. The degree of anisotropy was found to correlate with the clay and organic content in the rock and a strong anisotropy was observed in the rock Poisson's ratio compared to Young's modulus. Parallel Poisson's ratio were generally larger compared to the perpendicular Poisson's ratio which demonstrated similar magnitude to Poisson's ratio measured from samples with axis 45° to the bedding. Similar features were observed between the static and dynamic Young's modulus where values tend to decrease with increasing clay content. The conclusion of this work is a significant pointer to the fundamental geomechanical properties of the Roseneath and Murteree formation as well as the influence of material composition. This knowledge is crucial for drilling and designing brittle-ductile protocols for stimulation treatment that has the potential to unlock the shale play towards commercial production.|","Document Type

Cost-effective production from unconventional reservoirs relies on creating new reservoir surface area where fractures are extended into and produce from un-depleted zones. Field observations indicate infill well fractures could propagate towards nearby producers and depleted zones. This communication between infill and producer wells has been seen to cause casing collapse and negatively impact current production levels. In this paper, an integrated reservoir-geomechanics-fracture workflow is established to optimize infill well treatment schedule and to minimize fracture communication between wells. In particular, the paper presents: (i) numerical evaluation of depletion induced stress changes between tightly spaced producers, (ii) hydraulic fracture curving in a perturbed stress field, (iii) hydraulic fracture communication between wells, and infill well treatment design optimization to maximize production. 
A systematic study of depletion effects and the key parameters that control fracture curving allows us to improve the infill well fracture design by minimizing the communication between wells while maximizing the hydraulic fracture extent. Depletion perturbs the in-situ stress tensor in the formation around fractured horizontal wells. The analysis shows that the perturbed stress field is a function of stress/formation anisotropy, fluid mobility, pore pressure, operating bottom-hole pressure, and Biot's constant. A fracture propagation model, coupled with the altered in-situ stress field is utilized to predict the hydraulic fracture propagation path(s) and their radius of curvature (i.e., if the stress state dictates that the fractures should curve). The analyses are performed for different infill well treatment schedule(s), and output the most likely fracture geometries. Resulting infill well fracture geometries are imported into a reservoir simulator to quantify the production and to identify the optimum design parameters. 
The coupled workflow (geomechanics-fracture-reservoir) is then applied to a field example to demonstrate the feasibility of its application at the reservoir scale. The results show that (a) infill well fractures between tightly spaced horizontal wells can intentionally be curved and (b) communication between wells and fracture coverage area can be controlled by adjusting stimulation parameters to maximize recovery. Forward coupled modeling can be effective in advising when to drill infill wells before the altered stress state risks a commercial outcome.|","Document Type

Pore pressure in unconventional reservoirs has been identified as one of the key drivers in well performance. Additionally, pore pressure variations between strata may strongly influence hydraulic stimulation containment within target intervals. In the Midland Basin of west Texas, multiple stacked successions of economically proven organic-rich shale sequences vary both vertically and laterally in organic-richness, mineralogy, hydrocarbon storage, thermal maturity, and depth. Considering the variability in rock properties, it is reasonable to assume that pore pressures also vary to a similar degree. 
Previous authors have shown that the instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP) during the pad stage of a hydraulic stimulation can be used to approximate the closure stress in Wolfcamp shale reservoirs. By manipulating the uniaxial strain equation and substituting ISIP for closure stress, an approximation for pore pressure can be calculated. 
This paper describes the process of generating a basin-wide pore pressure model for all Spraberry and Wolfcamp intervals. The model was built using quality controlled pad ISIP data points from 8,602 vertical completions to create average pressure gradient profiles at 35 centroid locations across the Midland Basin. These profiles, along with available zone-specific Diagnostic Fracture Injection Test (DFIT) data, Sagerider System® bottomhole pressure data, and Electric Submersible Pump (ESP) pressure gradient estimates, were used to create pressure gradient maps for 17 stratigraphic intervals. To insure the accuracy of the maps, the pressure gradient maps were converted and cross-checked against actual drilling mud weights from horizontal wells drilled in a variety of Spraberry and Wolfcamp intervals across the basin. The improved pore pressure model has been used as an input into various geomechanical models and predictive maps for hydrocarbon production, resulting in refined well performance predictive maps. 
Additionally, a geologic explanation for the widely disparate pressure regimes present between the regionally subnormally pressured Spraberry and the generally overpressured Wolfcamp formations is proposed. Modeling by previous authors and proprietary PVT data is used to support the hypothesis that regional uplift, varying hydrocarbon compositions due to differing thermal maturities, and good sealing conditions present after hydrocarbon generation and uplift may explain the differences in pressure regimes between the formations.|",""

The objective of this study is to characterize highly productive zones of the Vaca Muerta Formation through a phased integrated structural, stratigraphic and production analysis in the Loma Campana Field, Neuquen Basin. This work is the first to provide detail at a field development level whereas previous studies were focused on a regional scale. 
The Loma Campana Field is the first large scale Shale Oil Development in Argentina which covers an area of 395 km2. The field is in active development phase and includes more than 300 producing vertical and horizontal wells with a total production that exceeds 20,000 BOPD. The structural setting is characterized by a low dipping monocline with two sets of faults, one being normal and the other inverted extensional, both reactivated from preexistent basement structures. 
The dataset that was utilized included 395 km2 of 3D PSDM seismic data, 215 wells with log data (35 with data suitable for 1D mechanical earth models), 5 wells with core, 29 wells with production logs, 140 wells with mudlog data and 20 microseismic surveys. 
Through the drilling campaign of pilot wells, a sweet spot was identified using production data compared with other areas of the field calibrated with subsequent data available from production logs. A detailed stratigraphic and structural framework was developed from the interpretation of the 3D seismic data and well logs. A higher order detail is needed to understand the impact of the heterogeneity of the reservoir on production. This resulted in the interpretation of twenty 5th-order regressive-transgressive parasequences inside the 4th-order sequences which correspond to highstand, lowstand and transgressive cycles. 
The results of this first phase permitted the definition of a stratigraphic framework in the zones of high productivity, associated with the lowstand facies which exhibit more favorable reservoir qualities and production. In addition, the study aided in the improved placement of vertical and horizontal wells in this higher productive area. The next phase of work will further integrate information by creating a 3D static geologic model populated with data from petrophysics, geomechanics, stimulation and production. The level of activity in the field and the heterogeneity of Vaca Muerta formation require regular updates to the workflow adding new data to adjust interpretations to optimize the development plan for the field.|","Document Type

Mechanical rock properties, along with in situ stresses and pore pressure, play critical roles in forming fractures in reservoir rocks. As part of a regional geomechanical analysis of the Duvernay resource play, several Duvernay cores were analyzed in detail, including the identification of different types of natural and induced fractures. The observed natural fractures include uncategorized natural fractures and polished slip faces (PSF) with rare presence of cleavage. Coring-induced fractures included petal and petal-centreline fractures and bed parallel parting (BPP). Comparison of the presence of the different fracture fabrics with mechanical and mineralogical properties of the rock revealed strong correlations between rock properties and fracture types. Such correlations may be efficiently implemented for characterization of fracture fabrics in the rock using wireline logs or seismic surveys. The observed natural and induced fractures in the cores have also been utilized to revisit and verify the concept of rock brittleness. The analyses show that, as a result of high clay content and overpressuring, the conventional mineralogical and mechanical brittleness indices do not adequately describe the variability of the Duvernay Formation stratigraphic units. Alternative indices developed for this study (i.e., plane-strain Young’s modulus and clay-based brittleness index) seem to be able to represent the mechanical behaviour of rock much more precisely. This study suggests that using natural and induced fracture fabrics observed on image logs and in cores, along with mineralogical and mechanical rock properties, is a more practical approach to assist with identifying sweet spots in unconventional plays.|","Document Type

An integrated cohesive modeling is proposed to analyse hydraulic fracturing jobs in the presence of a natural fracture network. A propagating hydraulic fracture may arrest, cross, or divert into a pre-existing natural fracture depending on fracture properties of rock, magnitude and direction of principal rock stresses, and angle between fractures. Activation of natural fractures during fracturing treatment improves the effectiveness of the stimulation tremendously. Here, we present an integrated methodology initiated with lab scale fracturing properties using Semi-Circular Bending Test (SCBT) to determine cohesive properties of rock and natural fractures. We used cohesive finite element models to reproduce laboratory results to verify the numerical model for the interaction of the hydraulic fracture and cemented natural fractures. Based on the initial results, distribution of pre-existing natural fractures could play a significant role in the final geometry of the induced fracture network; however in practice, there is not much information about the distribution of natural fractures in the subsurface due to the limited access. Hence, we also introduce a special optimization scheme to generate the geometry of the natural fracture network from the location of microseismic events. Accordingly, the criteria for evaluating the fitness of natural fracture realizations is defined as the total minimum distance squares of all microseismic events. Moreover, an additional constraint in this problem is that we need to set a minimum distance between fracture grids. Our results show a constructive approach to integrate microseismic maps with lab mechanical measurements and bottomhole pressure to estimate the geometry of induced fracture network in the subsurface which does not suffer from any limiting assumption about fracture geometries.|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing served as the principal technique to improve production in low permeability unconventional reservoirs in the last decade. Through core and outcrop studies, advanced logging tools, microseismic mapping and well testing analyses, it has further revealed the complexity of induced fracture network in the presence of natural fractures. Although most natural fractures are cemented by precipitations due to diagenesis, they can be reactivated during fracturing treatments and serve as preferential paths for fracture growth. However, current technologies for post-treatment assessment are incapable of accurately determine fracture geometry or even estimating the distribution of pre-existing natural fractures. Despite significant advances in numerical modelling of the problem, these models require an accurate description of natural fractures, which is often unknown to operators. Moreover, these numerical modeling techniques usually do not incorporate post-treatment data to reflect actual reservoir characteristics. This research proposes an innovative data integration workflow to estimate the characteristics of natural fractures based on formation evaluations, microseismic data, treatment data and production history. Least- square modeling approach is utilized to define possible realizations of natural fractures from selected double-couple microseismic events. Forward modeling incorporating Discrete Fracture Network will subsequently be used for matching treatment data and screening generated fracture realizations. Reservoir simulation tools will also be used thereafter to match the production data to further evaluate the fitness of natural fracture realizations. This workflow is able to integrate data from multiple aspects of the reservoir development process, and results from this workflow will provide both geologist and reservoir engineers an assessment tool for evaluating and modeling naturally fractured reservoirs.|","Document Type

The main structural features affecting the Mesozoic sequences of the Gulf rim are a series of interior salt basins extending from south Texas to Alabama. These basins formed during the rifting stage of the formation of the Gulf of Mexico. The early Oxfordian Smackover Formation, characterized by organic-rich, carbonate source rock intervals, represents the initial phase of the Late Jurassic marine transgression in the Gulf of Mexico Basin, where a density-stratified shallow sea was developed. It is predominantly composed of carbonates and calcareous shales and can easily be correlated by its lithology for considerable distances along its depositional strike. Over most of the Gulf coast, it can be subdivided into two distinct units. The Lower Smackover Formation (Brown Dense) is composed of dark-colored, organic-rich carbonate mudstone and dense argillaceous limestone deposited in a low-energy setting, while the Upper Smackover Formation is typically composed of coarser, grain-supported, porous carbonates formed in a high-energy shallow-water environment. Oil and gas resources have been produced from the more porous upper unit on which most geologic works have mainly focused. The Brown Dense has been, however, less studied, although it could become a viable resource play with the utilization of modern drilling techniques. 
Recently collected 450-ft (ca. 137 m) thick core and full-suite well logs have been studied to delineate geologic features, the results of which would be significant impact on exploration programs. The detailed geologic studies have revealed that 1) the Brown Dense interval comprises the multi-stacked cyclic succession, having the coarsening-upward trend, in which the basal part is dominated with organic-rich deposits, grading upward into algal laminite-like deposits, 2) each coarsening-upward succession (interpreted as parasequence), sharply demarcated by flooding surface, would be deposited during a regression period, 3) the porosity-permeability trend is characterized by organic-rich deposits that have relatively high effective porosity (average > 3%) and permeability (up to 5 µD), respectively 4) the presence of framboidal pyrites is mostly associated with organic-rich layers, where relatively high porosity is evident, 5) porosity is mainly comprised of the shelter type with some amounts of interparticle and intraparticle pores, and 6) cementation might be severe throughout the entire interval, but it would be limited within the organic layers.|","Document Type

Geomechanical modelling of hydraulic stimulations requires data to build and calibrate models to predict decline curves and other aspects of long-term reservoir performance. The initialization of these models requires knowledge of the pre-existing fractures and geological properties of the media. Orientations of different fracture sets, their intensities and spacing together with a characterization of their size scales (power law) critically impacts geomechanical predictions of both the stimulations in terms of proppant and fluid placement, but also the decline of reservoir productivity. Insight can be gained on the properties of the fracture network through analysis of the microseismic data generated during the stimulation. The frequency response of the waveforms depends on the size of the rupture and necessitates wide band recording in order to provide constraints at a variety of scales. Supplementing low frequency sensors with traditional monitoring high frequency sensors extends the resolvable range to larger scale lengths of fractures. For all these scales, with a sufficient sampling of azimuths around the stimulation, the mechanisms and associated fracture planes and stress/strain conditions can be reconstructed through seismic moment tensor inversion (SMTI) of the recorded waveforms. At smaller scale lengths, signal to noise ratios can be low, and events may not be observed at high enough quality to permit SMTI. To extend the characterization of these fractures to smaller scales, we use a stochastic optimization algorithm designed to search for optimally placed fractures in the reservoir that intersect with the event locations while constraining their orientations to be from the same distribution observed at the larger (SMTI resolvable) length scales. Effectively, this technique allows for the extension of the power law governing the fracture distribution to smaller scales by invoking observed trends in self-similar behavior. In turn, characterization of the wider band of fractures in the reservoir provides necessary inputs into geomechanical models to predict the fluid and proppant distributions from the full band of generated microseismicity as well as long-term behaviour of the reservoir though decline curve estimation.|","Document Type

Rock tensile strength is a critical parameter needed to design and model hydraulic fracturing (or crack initiation and propagation) in oil and gas reservoirs, especially in tight organic-rich shale. Conventional methods for measuring rock tensile strength are either time consuming (direct tensile strength method) or unreliable (indirect method), and require precision ""machined"" samples and heavy mechanical instruments. We propose a new technique that is simple and rapid for measuring the tensile strength of rocks with low permeability using microwave heating. 
Our method is developed based on the fact that when the temperature of water in a confined space, e.g., within a tight rock, increases, water cannot freely expand and consequently the pressure within water-filed pores quickly elevates to the point where it exceeds the rock’s tensile strength such that the rock breaks. Microwave heating can rapidly increase the temperature of water in the rock sample due to the relatively large dielectric loss of innate water. This method works well for rocks with low permeability where pressure leak off during the rapid heating is negligible. This paper presents both the theory and results of our initial laboratory tests for the microwaving heating method. 
The test results demonstrate that microwaving cracks and sometimes pulverizes shales and tight sandstones with water content. When the sample is pulverized, likely 100% of the light hydrocarbons will be released. Hence, the proposed method also may provide insight into total recoverable light hydrocarbons per kilogram. We believe that microwave (or electromagnetic wave (EM)) heating approach, for some tight reservoirs, has the potential to be further developed to provide a practical waterless fracturing technology.|","Document Type

It is widely observed that hydrocarbon production declines rapidly in unconventional reservoirs. Consequently, restimulation may be necessary to enhance production and ultimate recovery. Local stress fields around the fractures will change during reservoir depletion due to the fluid flow and deformation induced by the mechanical interference among fractures. The perturbed stress field may significantly affect fracture propagation in subsequent refracturing operations. 
In this paper, the stress tensor change during reservoir production is explored by a coupled geomechanical and reservoir fluid flow model. The initial stress field is simulated by using a discretized displacement method. The altered stress field is calculated by superposition of the initial stress field and the pore pressure change due to production. Key considerations of refrac propagation directions and sizes of treatments are explored for optimizing refracturing treatment designs. 
Our results demonstrate that the stress field around the initial hydraulic fracture(s) may change significantly, as the reservoir begins to deplete. The altered stress field can result in varied and time dependent fracture propagation directions during any re fracturing treatments. Consequently, engineering design decisions for the propped fracture treatment along with application of diverting agents, must consider these effects. Based on parametric studies, we reevaluate the stress field alteration theory in terms of production time and stress anisotropy. Quantification of stress field changes during reservoir depletion provides new insights for the design and evaluation of refracturing treatments to enhance field development.|","Document Type

Liquid-rich shale (LRS) reservoirs, particularly lean and rich gas-condensates, are economically attractive but pose unique production challenges. These include productivity losses caused by condensate banking, saturation pressure changes due to pore confinement, and the associated rock-fluid interactions. In recent years, development of these types of reservoirs has advanced with optimal lateral well placement and innovative completion designs. It has been well recognized that initial production rates, their decline during depletion, and the ultimate liquid recoveries are severely impacted by the fluid, rock, rock-fluid properties, and the completions design. Thus, it is critical to have an in-depth understanding of the controlling factors related to fluids, rock and rock-fluid parameters that affect the long-term production performance of these reservoirs. 
We have conducted detailed reservoir simulation studies based on a sector model to investigate the sensitivity of rock, fluid, and rock-fluid parameters, and modeling fracture properties on reservoir performance. The reservoir model consists of a horizontal well and a network of hydraulic, induced. and natural fractures embedded in the rock matrix. The model also includes the effects of changes in fluid saturation pressures due to pore confinement and altered fluid phase behavior in nano-pore environments, interfacial tension (IFT)-dependent gas-condensate relative permeability curves and end-points, and the matrix and fracture properties. Sensitivity runs allow comparisons of reservoir performance predictions of rates, condensate dropout and the resulting condensate blocking, and ultimate liquid recovery potential. 
We developed a number of gas-condensate fluid models covering a range of Condensate to Gas Ratios (CGRs) (50 to 250 stb/MMscf) and implementing dewpoint suppression/elevation in nano-pore matrix and its impact on liquid dropout and condensate banking. In this article, we illustrate the results of the simulation study using a relatively rich condensate with a CGR ~100 stb/mmscf. We also used interfacial-tension dependent relative permeability curves and critical condensate saturations (Scc) for the matrix and for fractures. The compaction effects of matrix and the fractures during depletion were also accounted for. 
We conducted a number of sensitivity runs, including elevation/suppression of fluid saturation pressures, IFT- dependent relative permeability, critical condensate saturations, and condensate blocking. Based on the results of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:  
Well rate and its decline with time (pressure) are highly sensitive to the fluid, rock, and the rock-fluid parameters, such as the dewpoint pressure, the relative permeability Corey exponents and ends point saturations. 
Ultimate liquid recovery is impacted by the condensate dropout characteristics, IFT, and saturation pressure changes. 
The liquid recovery is impacted by the leaning of produced fluids with pressure decline, mobilization of dropped-out condensates, and IFT effects on the relative permeability. 
Condensate blocking severely affects gas rates and hence the well productivity. |The results served as a basis for and guided reservoir development strategies and production planning.|","Document Type

In unconventional reservoirs such as organic shales, elastic properties not only have a great influence on stress concentration around the wellbore, they also affect fracture initiation. Rock fabric can substantially affect the elastic properties of organic mudrocks because of their complex and highly anisotropic internal grain/clay structure. The spatial anisotropy exhibited by laminated shales is a macroscopic manifestation of the fine layering of clay and larger solid constituents and the horizontal alignment of solid and porous inclusions. Laminations and alignment of rock fabric constituents affect the mechanical properties of the rock and control the rock's shear failure when stimulated hydraulically. Therefore, measuring the type and degree of rock fabric anisotropy is of utmost importance when attempting to locate optimum depths along a vertical well trajectory to drill a horizontal well. This paper introduces a new method to estimate rock fabric jointly from sonic and electrical resistivity logs. A combination of effective medium theories (EMT) reconstructs rock constituents and accounts for anisotropy due to inclusion shape. Our model invokes anisotropic versions of both the differential effective medium (DEM) model and the self-consistent approximation (SCA) in conjunction with the Backus average to reproduce the fine layering of these formations, and thereafter to evaluate the resulting stiffness tensor of the effective medium and its electrical properties. Phase velocities of compressional- and shear-wave propagation are then calculated using the estimated stiffness of the rock. The rock physics model is validated by comparing the computed properties against available sonic and resistivity logs. Our simulation method is implemented in one vertical well in the Barnett shale and gives rise to accurate estimates of wave velocities, with differences below 4% between simulated and measured velocities. Once the stiffness of the rock has been estimated it can be used as input into analytical solutions to calculate stress distribution around possible horizontal wells drilled at different depths along the vertical well. The estimated rock stiffness can also be used to study the variations of fracture initiation pressure with the degree of anisotropy. Estimates of the elastic properties of the rock enable us to identify where the rock is most susceptible to experience controlled shear failure.|","Document Type

Double-emulsion microfluidic techniques can produce small spherical capsules, hundreds of microns or less in diameter, capable of containing a wide variety of materials. By carefully selecting the outer shell material, microcapsules can be created that release their contents (i.e., are ""triggered"") under specific thermal or chemical conditions. As such, microcapsules provide an extremely versatile delivery mechanism for transporting target materials for tracer, proppant, or stimulation applications into natural and man-made fracture systems. Moreover, the capsules can be engineered to have densities above, below or even close to neutrally buoyant with the carrier fluid, thereby enabling their transport properties to be tailored for a given task. 
Design of microencapsulated particles for specific applications requires accurate models describing their subsurface transport. A principal application for such micro-encapsulated particles is as a substitute for, or as an additive to, traditional fracture proppant. However, the distances that even such traditional proppants are able to penetrate into natural rock systems is poorly understood, in part due to the uncertainties surrounding the methods used to model their transport. 
In this work, we present ongoing research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory into both the fabrication of double-emulsion microcapsules for energy applications, and the transport properties of these particles. We discuss different triggering mechanisms and materials for the capsules, and their potential applications. The transport behavior of the capsules close to the neutrally buoyant limit is also described, through experiments and numerical simulations to test settling rates and the role of particle-particle interactions on capsule transport in fractures.

Duffy, Repsol| Rodriguez, Alejandro, Repsol| Grood, Rudy de, Repsol| Gil, Jose, Repsol| McCarty, Reid S., SandRidge| Baycroft, Perry, Baycroft Consulting Services","|Abstract 
Historically, operators in tight oil carbonate resources, following the shale gas paradigm, drill and stimulate most wells in the same way. Typical wells are single laterals, hydraulically fractured near the reservoir top with no clear understanding of the fluid segregation mechanism. Since this reservoir is producing with very high water cuts (normally above 90%), deployment of electric submersible pumps (ESP) has been widely applied. As pressure declines, difficulties with high gas volumes and slugging have been an operational and cost challenge. By applying an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach, The Event Solution, a project team combined all available data types to fully understand the reservoir mechanisms. Geological and simulation models were utilized to understand and test reservoir development concepts, including operational and cost parameters. A pilot well design was applied for testing and acquiring knowledge implementing an innovative well design with the maximum reservoir contact (MRC) concept. The design consists of one upper hydraulically fractured horizontal well, one hydraulically fractured middle horizontal well and a lower well with five unstimulated open-hole laterals. The upper well ESP sump provides the best way to produce high gas-cut liquids while minimizing gas slugging and interventions. The lower well laterals (with MRC configuration) provide the means to create gravity segregation across the reservoir, pulling water down while still producing low oil cuts. The middle well is the main oil producer with higher oil cuts. Stimulation tracers, well testing and simulation show a geo-mechanical pressure dependency on production indicating that below certain bottom-hole flowing pressures fractures tend to close somewhat and vertical communication is lost; above that pressure, fractures and vertical communication open. Managing communication between all existing laterals at multiple levels in the reservoir is possible. With these understandings, optimized and consistent development with higher oil recovery can be achieved at lower costs. It is envisioned that MRC designs are widely applicable to other tight oil carbonate resources.|","Document Type

Geometries of fractures, both natural and hydraulically induced, are commonly represented by a discrete fracture network (DFN) in reservoir simulations. Although microseismic data is the best diagnostic tool for imaging the volume of rock fractured, its incompleteness in representing the total deformation presents a challenge in interpreting the complex fracture networks from hydraulic fracturing. While microseismicity under-represents most of the tensile fracture volume created, the hydraulic fracturing modeling software can, in principle, generate the full hydraulically induced fracture network. Unlike other simulation methods that assume simple planar geometry, the unconventional fracture model (UFM) simulates complex fracture structure, but requires a reliable description of natural fractures in the formations with determined locations of the fracture patches as the input. The DFNs derived from measurements such as well bore image logs and seismic properties have large uncertainties due to gross differences in scale of measurement compared with the hydraulic fracture process. Microseismic data can be used as direct evidence of hydraulically induced fracture propagation to calibrate the fracture model, as a constraint to the DFN used in UFM to recover information such as the effective surface area, aperture and retained permeability. 
This study presents a workflow to use the microseismic data including source mechanism information in UFM for complex fracture calibration and simulation. A dual well monitoring data set from 8-stages of a 30 stage sliding-sleeve hydraulic fracturing treatment in the Cardium formation, west central Alberta, Canada is used as a case study to demonstrate the workflow. First, moment tensor inversion is conducted to estimate the fault plane solutions. Second, a DFN is extracted from the microseismic event locations and fault plane solutions. Third, rheology and geomechanics models generated from the well logs from the offset wells are calibrated by applying the DFN from the second step as the input into UFM to match the microseismic geometry and treating pressure. Last, the simulated complex fracture networks with full information, such as aperture and conductivity, are input to reservoir simulation for production simulation and reservoir management. This approach is compared with a traditional P3D fracture model. The results shows that using the DFN extracted from the microseismic data reduces the uncertainty of the models input into the hydraulic fracturing modeling and results in better pressure and geometry fitting.|","Document Type

The impact of the natural fractures on the efficiency of a hydraulic fracture is quantified using geomechanical modeling that is able to identify poor hydraulic frac stages clustered where there are too many natural fractures near faults or around low fracture density zones. The best hydraulic fracture stages appear to cluster where there are sufficient natural fractures to create complexity, and are often proximal to large natural fracture trends associated with faults. 
This paper describes workflows to quantify the impact of natural fractures on the performance of shale wells. First, a method described by White et al., (2014) is reviewed to illustrate the regression analysis approach which may be used on a small area where many image logs and production are available. Then, a general workflow that combines Geophysics, Geology and Geomechanics (3G) is discussed and applied to a Wolfcamp well. The benefits of the 3G workflow are threefold. First, the quantitative impact of the natural fractures on the regional stress is provided through the differential horizontal stress variation which impacts frac complexity. Secondly, an effective modeling technique which accounts for the interaction between the hydraulic and natural fractures in creating the reservoir strain and drainage pathways is described and validated using microseismic data. Thirdly, the ability of this model to identify the poor hydraulic frac stages due to the excessive or low fracture density encountered along the wellbore is discussed. 
Building on the validated 3G workflow, a well placement workflow that takes into the account the quantitative impact of natural fractures on the well performance is demonstrated on the considered Wolfcamp B well. The workflow provides the optimal position of a well in the presence of natural fractures associated with a fault system that could produce undesirable water. With the current downturn in the petroleum market, it is becoming increasingly important to optimize well placement and completion by using advanced techniques as described by this paper.|","Document Type

In this paper, a brief review of a study of pressure dependent SRV region that takes shape during water injection in the fracturing process and reduces in size during production is presented. The pressure depletion and natural fracture permeability distribution pattern derived from this reservoir simulation analysis will help understand the feasibility of re-fracturing. The phenomenon of shear dilation, resulting in self-propping of natural fractures due to irregularities present on the rock surface, is captured in this study through the use of a dilation rock model for the natural fractures which acts as an effective geomechanical proxy. 
The natural fractures were assumed to be closed at the start of the water injection process during fracturing and their initial permeability was assumed to be equal to that of the matrix in the virgin rock. As water was injected during the hydraulic fracturing operation, permeability of the natural fractures increased marginally with pressure until the fractures became critically stressed (at the shear dilation onset pressure). Beyond the shear dilation onset pressure, the natural fracture permeability increased rapidly with pressure. This gave rise to a dynamic SRV around the hydraulic fractures. Based on this concept, a simulation model was constructed and history matched to an existing Eagle Ford well producing from the oil window with 19 stages, after which a re-fracture was simulated. Sensitivity analysis was done to bracket the range of incremental EURs that can be obtained upon re-fracturing. 
The results of the history matched model showed an elliptical SRV region around each hydraulic fracture that dissipates over time during production. Also, it was found that an inversion of natural fracture permeability takes place as the pressure decreases first near the wellbore during production. Pressure depletion shows that there is a significant amount of oil saturation left between the fractures. This provides the rationale for re-fracturing between existing fractures, which may not be possible at the time of first completion due to stress shadow prohibiting closer spacing. The forecast production shows a significant increase in the EUR upon re-stimulation. 
The industry is already looking at re-fracturing as an alternative to drilling new wells to increase their reserves and this study ties in to that need to explain the why and the how of the re-fracturing process.|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracture conductivity losses because of proppant embedment, proppant failure and rock damage by nonnative fluid interactions are the leading cause of drops in well productivity. These conductivity losses are strongly governed by the local stress regime in the vicinity of the fracture face and the geomechanical responses of the rock to these stresses. Drawdown management for shale wells seeks to minimize fracture conductivity losses and matrix permeability impairment in order to create conditions for favorable long-term well performance. This is achieved by controlling drawdown to manage near-wellbore and near-fracture stresses to avoid or mitigate proppant embedment and sharp fracture conductivity decline. However, these approaches may also lead to poor initial production trends. 
This work focuses on the use of a coupled geomechanical and reservoir flow model for optimizing choke or drawdown management to maximize NPV for liquids-rich shale wells. Geologic analysis, reservoir and fluid properties and completion-related properties acquired from a prominent liquids-rich shale play within the continental US forms the basis of our study. Three different stress sensitive models are used as a proxy for soft, medium and stiff rocks to simulate different degrees of irreversible rock deformation. The geomechanical model considers the effects of hysteresis and choke management strategies developed for a diverse set of rock mechanical properties. 
The Productivity Index (PI) along with the cumulative rates are used to evaluate the effectiveness of any chosen choke management strategy. Our results indicate that the most critical time period for optimizing long-term well management is during the initial life of the well. High production rates with sharp declines, typical of shale reservoirs, causes irreversible damage in the vicinity of the fracture affecting its conductivity. Choking back the wells in anticipation of longer term stable production profiles is also shown to be less than optimal. We compare and contrast several different drawdown settings and demonstrate that the choice of a larger choke setting during the initial life of the well coincides with the highest possible NPV and recovery factors over a wide range of reservoir and fluid properties. Our results also indicate that irrespective of the choice of drawdown setting, the losses in fracture conductivity and matrix permeability tend to be very severe in the first few days of production.|","Document Type

Fracture potential of challenging rocks determines the ability of rock to create complex, extensive and highly connected fracture networks that remain open during production. Prediction of a robust fracture potential is a prerequisite for optimized stimulation design and maximized conductive reservoir volume. However, fracture potential is not a material property. Contrary to common belief, fracability, brittleness are not characteristic properties but rather a rate and stress dependent material behavior for a given rock type. During hydraulic fracture operations and/or production, not all stages respond the same. Certain stages along a wellbore respond to fracturing operations better and exhibit increased fracturing potential. Current industry practice involves using logs to perform quick look analysis along wellbores to unlock this potential, and usually results in a general fracability or brittleness indicator. Stage locations, number and size selection are based on parameters that are not appropriately integrated and correlated to the fracturing potential. In order to fully characterize the fracture behavior and optimize stimulation design, key attributes that control fracture initiation, propagation, opening and closure need to be identified, their relative impact/weight(s) need to be quantified and integrated. Attributes can include a combination of elastic properties, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), anisotropy, cohesion, friction angle (FA), fracture toughness, stress, mechanical/stress anisotropy, natural fracture reactivation and petrophysical properties such as hydrocarbon potential, permeability, porosity, and characterization of lithology. In this paper, a new approach is introduced to evaluate fracture potential and optimize hydraulic fracture stage design. This approach serves as an uplift to standard fracability predictions and provides proxies for near wellbore fracture initiation and closure characteristics. In addition, the proposed workflow provides a fully automated stage design algorithm that can run on multiple parameter combinations and available data according to the nature and evolution of the reservoirs' environment. The automated procedure employs an optimization approach, which mathematically formalizes the notion of stage design by seeking to minimize the total intra-stage variability of fracturing potential subject to any desired operational constraints. The integrated and automated workflow for selecting and designing stages is quick, efficient, repeatable and flexible. The workflow is described in detail and application of stage design algorithm is demonstrated using a field data set.|","Document Type

Shale gas plays have taken precedence over shale oil plays since 2009. With the price of oil falling, gas may take a more predominant role in 2015. In 2010, in a paper presented at the SPE Technical Conference and Exhibition (SPE-135555-MS), authors of this paper analyzed the production decline trends from public data in five major US shale gas basins—Barnett, Fayetteville, Woodford, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford. Much has changed over this time, and rig counts have fallen in gas-rich areas all over the US from their 2010 numbers. Over that same period, gas production from these five plays has increased from 9.2 Bscf/D to 16.7 Bscf/D. Shale gas decline trends continue to be a point of contention in the industry from some consultants and investment firms. This manuscript builds upon the previously published work to include new production from the last five years. Updates to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) analyses and the overall economic feasibility of horizontal shale gas wells were made taking into consideration of how new wells have performed. 
In this new study, we updated the production of existing wells (used in our previous study) and included production from new wells. We used the same geologic areas as before, with a refinement made for the Haynesville and Eagle Ford plays. We compared the original Arps decline curve estimation predicted in the previous publication and the new estimation performed with five years' additional data. Changes in EUR by play and vintage were also studied as was the impact of available production history on Arps's decline parameters for each basin. From these analyses, we developed recommendations for a minimum production period to properly assess EURs when using Arps method. 
The production type curves by play were updated with wells drilled in the studied geographic areas from 2010 onwards. These newer vintage wells were compared with older wells to determine which plays are still realizing improved well performance and which plays have seen some plateauing or decrease in production. The drilling and completion factors were analyzed in plays where average well production continues to improve, and we investigated possible contributing factors impairing production of new wells in plateauing shale plays. 
An economic analysis was performed to determine the break-even cost for each shale gas basins studied. The decline curves and EURs were incorporated along with well costs. This study helps to explain if wells are still improving in each basin, what the improvement drivers are, and what impact infill drilling has had on these plays.|","Document Type

The Lower Silurian Qusaiba Hot Shale (QHS) has long been known as the major source rock in the Paleozoic petroleum system of Saudi Arabia. However, during the last few years, special focus has been directed toward this formation as a candidate for unconventional shale gas reservoir due to its high organic content, laterally extensive occurrence and reasonable vertical thickness. Yet, one of the main challenges is the lack of understanding of the size, distribution, and types of the micro-porosity systems in this organic-rich shale. This work provides an integrated analysis of the micro-porosity in QHS. 
Comprehensive sequential analysis includes thin section petrography, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. In particular, these techniques were used to characterize the micro-porosity systems of six subsurface core samples of QHS from the Rub'al-Khali basin, Saudi Arabia. 
The investigated samples consist mainly of dark to light grey, silty, flaky-to-subflaky, micaceous, non-calcareous, highly-cemented shales. Three lithofacies have been identified from the petrographic analysis of QHS: silica-rich, clay-rich, and mica-rich mudstone facies. Micro-porosity in the studied samples reflects high diversity in both pore size and type. The micro-porosity fraction of the investigated shale comes in three major groups according to origin: (1) inorganic micro-porosity, which is commonly associated with the inorganic components of QHS (Silica-Mica - clay and pyrite mineral grains), particularly due to the random edge-face clay and mica flake orientation as well as the dissolution and degradation of pyrite framboids; (2) organic-related micro-porosity which mainly occurs inside the organic particles as a result of thermal maturity; and (3) microfracture-related micro-porosity. 
Low field NMR has been used to examine the T1 and T2 relaxation times. The total porosity measured by T1 for the three identified lithofacies ranges between 6.6 and 0.9 p.u., with the highest values corresponding to the mica-rich mudstone facies (6.6 and 6.5) and the lowest values corresponding to the silica-rich mudstone facies (0.9 and 1.4). As for the clay-rich mudstone facies, it had an intermediate porosity (3.2-3.3). The presence of bimodal porosity size in QHS is clearly reflected by the T1 results. NMR results also showed that organic-related porosity which represented by the primary relaxation peak is greater than the inorganic-related porosity, which is represented by the secondary relaxation peak.|","Document Type

The nanoscale porosities in shales have been widely studied by industry with emphasis on organo-porosity and its significant to migration (and generation) of hydrocarbons. However, not much attention is paid to the next scale up, which would include burrows to provide potential migration pathways. The original intent of the work was to evaluate whether burrows were sufficiently abundant and interconnected to provide permeability pathways at the scale of the burrows. 
The Woodford Shale in the Anadarko basin, Oklahoma has been one of the major unconventional plays in the United States for nearly a decade. This research has fully utilized ultra-high-resolution (625 micron increment per slice) and advanced 3-D Micro-CT scan technology to quantitatively describe and analyze the ichnofacies and microfacies in selected Woodford cores. The ichnofacies in the Woodford shale cores have been categorized into short and long Chondrites, Paleodictyon, Thalassinoides and Planolites. The 3-D geometries, abundance, and diversity of ichnofacies have been quantitatively described. Bioturbation Index (BI) was calculated from the sum of the abundance of all ichnofacies in each stratigraphic interval. The BI was then compared with XRF, XRD and geochemistry data to relate ichnofacies, paleo-redox environment, and sediment provenance. The stratigraphic distributions of these properties were found to be related to sea-level fluctuation, biostratigraphy (from Conodonts), and sequence stratigraphy. 
Our results indicate that bioturbation and bio-activities are more common in Woodford shale than previously thought. They are not sufficiently abundant and vertically interconnected to provide permeability pathways at the scale of the burrows. However, in some core sections, the horizontal burrows are sufficiently connected within thin laminae. There is not much in the way of vertical connectivity of burrows, but along what appear to be some bedding planes there are enough touching burrows to make a permeability pathway. Although burrows frequently develop in highstand systems tracts, they also occur in presumably anoxic environments conducive to preservation of high TOC content and biogenic quartz. These relationships can aid in targeting the best horizontal landing zones in the Woodford shale.|","Document Type

In an unconventional tight oil play with natural fractures, the main drive mechanisms are depletion above the bubble point and compaction. They are not easily recognized yet play a major role in diminishing performance. An extensive integrated study, using the Event Solution approach, of a Mid-continent naturally fractured tight oil carbonate resource was undertaken to examine the causes of performance variability. The integrated study included a thorough petrophysical and fluid characterization. Drive mechanisms were associated with specific rock types and in relation with fracture density, explaining performance characteristics. Extensive numerical simulation was used to combine characterization and historical performance. Initially the dominant drive mechanisms are depletion and compaction. Later, gravity drainage plays a significant role but its benefits are not captured with the initial well designs. Previously, wells were placed at the top of the reservoir and hydraulic fractures extended downwards. The study concluded that applying a different well type, multi-laterals extended both laterally and stacked vertically, can leverage on gravity drainage. An innovative well design was implemented to capture the benefits of multiple drive mechanisms. Additionally, the optimized operating conditions were identified to maximize impact. As a result, it is possible to increase recovery efficiency at a lower capital and operating cost. The learnings from this project can benefit the continued development and also serve as a paradigm in the very important tight oil plays in North America, which are largely carbonate with various degrees of natural fracturing.|","Document Type

A comprehensive reservoir surveillance program was carried out in the Haynesville Shale, supporting analytical simulation efforts and developing a new method to forecast future production for this overpressured reservoir where forecasting with modified decline curve analysis is challenging. The key concept involved constraining non-unique history matches through utilizing Rate Transient Analysis (RTA) characterization of the reservoir and completion designs with early well performance to guide subsequent modeling of the reservoir. 
The three step approach consisted of 1) identifying observed and anticipated flow regimes through Rate Transient Analysis diagnostics, 2) incorporating these into an analytical model to match production history, and 3) generating production forecasts with the history matched analytical model, with verification by numerical modeling on representative wells. 
More than 325 wells with production and pressure data were evaluated. In each well, different flow regimes were identified with rate transient analysis diagnostic plots, capturing the product of the cross sectional area of flow and square root of permeability (Avk), time to the end of linear flow (Telf), and the Area of Stimulated Rock Volume (SRV). Petrophysical and geomechanical properties for the model were interpolated for each producer, sourced from a regional 3D geologic model which integrated more than 130 pilot wells with petrophysical analysis and 55 wells with core analysis. 
As a result of the integration of geological modeling, reservoir surveillance and analytical simulation efforts a new forecasting methodology was generated and confirmed by correlations between well performance, Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) and Avk. Furthermore, an alternative fracture efficiency approach was derived from the Telf and depth of investigation from the linear transient equation. The results of this calculation suggest that previous completion designs generated few, but long fractures, consistent with evidence of frac hits in the field.|","Document Type

G., University of Manchester| Garcia-Fresca, Beatriz, Statoil Gulf Services, Houston, Texas, USA","|Abstract 
The Eagle Ford Fm in southwest Texas is a self-sourced oil and gas reservoir currently stimulated through hydraulic fracturing to produce economic quantities of hydrocarbons. Both early and burial diagenesis has had a major impact upon the rocks and their resulting reservoir quality. In this presentation we infer mineral reactions and precipitation that took place during diagenesis through a combination of mineralogical and petrographic analysis using XRD, optical and electron microscopy. We highlight how such an understanding can improve prediction of rock properties and reservoir quality. 
Along with compaction and de-watering, we infer that bacterial sulphate reduction had a major impact during early diagenesis as it resulted in significant calcite cement precipitation. Calcite cements infill bioclasts and foraminifera chambers, thereby significantly reducing intra-granular porosity. Fine grained calcite cements the matrix and coccolith fragments that resulted in reduction in inter-granular porosity and its interlocking texture will likely lead to an increase in rock brittleness. Optical microscopy and cathodoluminescence (CL) highlight the extensive and invasive calcite precipitation that occurs within concretional features in the Eagle Ford Fm. Zonation within the calcite cements suggests evolution in pore water chemistry and this is interpreted to be caused by changes in microbial organic matter oxidation. 
Foraminifera chambers are commonly infilled with kaolinite, as well as or instead of calcite. There is no clear petrographic evidence to suggest which came first, but based on the fact the foraminifera are not compacted we infer early diagenetic origin. Unlike the calcite infills, kaolinite infills preserve significant inter-crystalline porosity. Authigenic kaolinite is also present as multiple crystal grains within the matrix, and replacing 30–60µm detrital grains- which we infer to be feldspars. 
During late burial, authigenic quartz cement commonly precipitated around detrital quartz grains and calcite cements, further reducing inter-particle and inter-crystalline porosity. This source of this silica may have been clay mineral reactions or biogenic silica dissolution. Chlorite is present in the form of 5~15µm wispy flakes in the most thermally mature samples. The precipitation of clay minerals during deeper burial leads likely to a decrease in rock brittleness and a further reduction in micro-porosity in the matrix.|","Document Type

An outstanding question in the design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment is how fractures, which often initiate in ‘non-ideal' orientations under the influence of near-field stress concentrations, propagate outwards and turn towards their ideal orientations under the far-field stress conditions. The major application of this work is to predict the amount and character of near-wellbore complexity as a function of formation characteristics and the pumping fluid viscosity and flow rate. We present the results of multiple 3D hydraulic fracturing simulations to illustrate the general problem of fracture initiation from a circular wellbore. Our results are distinct from previously published results because we do not artificially constrain the growth of the hydraulic fracture. This work improves our understanding of how hydraulic fractures initiate and propagate in the near-wellbore region.|","Document Type

The complex geology, geomechanics and flow mechanisms make it difficult to predict the drainage area of shale wells, and thus the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) from these reservoirs. A large uncertainty in predicting the drainage area and EUR can result in a sub-optimal development plan - a key factor driving the economics of such reservoirs. 
To increase our confidence in the drainage area and EUR predictions in the Haynesville, we applied an integrated production analysis approach using multiple data types from a single multi-frac horizontal well with a rich dataset. The analysis integrates Flowing Material Balance (FMB), Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA), Rate Transient Analysis (RTA), Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), and analytical/numerical reservoir simulation. Using detailed well completion and production logging data, we created nine alternative models that honored the historical production and flowing pressure data. These alternative forecasts were generated using readily available commercial software that includes the Multi-frac Horizontal Composite (MFC) model, the Enhanced Fracture Region (EFR) model and the General Multi-frac (GMF) model. In this paper, we demonstrate how certain models used routinely in the industry may be too simplistic, and how these models can be progressively improved as more production and flowing pressure data become available with time. 
Our results demonstrate the following: |Permanent down-hole pressure gauges, hourly metered production rates and production logs provide high frequency historical data that enable more insightful PTA, RTA and detailed non-uniform fractured reservoir simulation models; 
Inclusion of higher frequency data and geomechanical (i.e. pressure dependency) effects are critical for both PTA and RTA in shale wells. This is especially true where permeability dependence on pressure has been documented, such as in the Haynesville. PTA can be useful in constraining the history-match but the results are still non-unique; 
Routinely used uniform fracture half-length/evenly-spaced fracture analytical models may be too idealized for optimizing well spacing and completion design. Numerical reservoir simulation models with more detailed and realistic reservoir characterization and fracture dimensions are therefore key in planning appropriate well spacing; |This work provides valuable guidelines for data acquisition and prediction of shale gas EUR and optimal well spacing.|","Document Type

During the exploration and development of a tight oil carbonate resource in the U.S. Midcontinent, the impact of natural fractures and hydraulic fracture design on well performance was historically misunderstood or ignored. No apparent correlation between well performance and subsurface geology was recognized. Through applying a collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach, The ""Event Solution"", a project team integrated all available data types from core scale to regional tectonics to characterize and model the hierarchy of natural fractures over approximately 11,000 square miles. Through the integration of whole cores, image logs, 3D seismic, detailed structural mapping, regional gravity and magnetics, satellite imagery, hydraulic fracture modeling, and geomechanics, the fundamental impact of natural fractures on drive mechanisms and well interference are now understood. Large-scale fracture fairways, that extend across the entire reservoir and beyond, are identified by 3D seismic, lost circulation, and stimulation pressure anomalies. Surprisingly, fracture fairways provide initial higher oil cut. Smaller-scale fracture corridors, that exists near fairways and extend only 20-30 feet within the reservoir, are identified by seismic attributes and production performance data. Background fractures or layer bound fractures, within reservoir units of a few feet in vertical extent, are seen in horizontal image logs. Fracture fairways provide regional fluid conduits and fluid segregates vertically into gas accumulations near the top with water accumulations deeper near the bottom. Fracture corridors on the other hand have the most profound effect on productivity and vertical communication. Background fractures in horizontal wells provide higher initial productivity. The understanding of natural fractures led to a new well design. A pilot well confirmed the observed and modeled fluid movements in the fracture system and the effect of communication through the interaction of the natural and hydraulic fracture systems. Results of this work provide improved methods for exploiting tight oil naturally fractured resources.|","Document Type

The genesis and relationship between the existence of bedding-parallel, calcite-filled fractures known as ""beef fractures"" and different organic-rich shale and geomechanical facies has been examined by interpreting the concentration of these fractures across various facies. 
The force of petroleum expulsion is complimented with the force of crystallization to explain a possible mechanism for generating ""beef fractures."" Bedding-parallel fracturing is always favored during petroleum expulsion in organic-rich shales. The mechanism of forming veins, in general, has long been debated. It has been whether vein crystals infill preexisting fractures or grow and propagate the vein by causing the fracturing. This study concludes with a suggested process for forming ""beef fractures"" in organic-rich shales as follows: |Force of petroleum expulsion creates sites of opportunities in the form of bedding-parallel fractures; 
Thin film of supersaturated solution in-fills these sites of opportunities; 
Mineral crystals utilize the site of opportunities and use them as sites for precipitation; 
Crystal growth exerts pressure creating force of crystallization; 
Depending on the aspect ratio of fracture, the force of crystallization extends the fracture forming the ""beef"" with prismatic calcite crystals growing perpendicular to the fracture walls. |Observations and data analyses were made on six organic-rich shales: 1) Devonian/Mississippian Bakken, 2 and 3) Jurassic Haynesville and Vaca Muerta, 4 and 5) Late Cretaceous Niobrara and Eagle Ford, and 6) Eocene Green River (Mahogany Bench). The results provide explanations of the associations of bedding-parallel fracturing with organic-rich shale and geomechanical facies. The zone of intense beef-fracturing corresponds to the most organically rich and mechanically anisotropic intervals. The minimum petroleum-generation pressure required for initiating bedding-parallel expulsion fractures was calculated, plotted and correlated with ""beef fracture"" intensity and mechanical anisotropy. A good correlation was observed. 
Five distinctive attributes are recognized as being associated with the existence of pervasive ""beef fractures"" in shales: 1) organic-richness, 2) thermal maturity, 3) overpressuring, 4) mechanical anisotropy and 5) calcareous material in the shales (e.g., coccoliths in the Mesozoic examples).|","Document Type

We introduce a history match case study using a newly developed hydraulic fracturing software. This fracturing software has been developed for unconventional reservoirs that is well-suited for modeling complex hydraulic fracturing treatments along horizontal wells. The software utilizes rigorous fracture mechanics models to accurately capture the broad complexity of unconventional hydraulic fracturing treatment designs. Included in the software design capabilities is the interaction of non-planar fractures with both multiple fracture stages and multiple wells, and compatibility with both gel injections and slick water. Extensive bench testing has been conducted to validate the fundamental theory and numerical techniques using known analytical solutions, as well as testing with both toughness and viscosity controlled hydraulic fracture. The effectiveness of the modeling software and its unique features are demonstrated using a field case study featuring a multi-stage horizontal well fracturing treatment with microseismic mapping. The fracture configuration matches well with microseismic data, and we are able to show modeling of both simultaneous and sequential multiple fracture propagation throughout the injection life. Technical evaluation of the case study results shows that through use of the new rigorous software and applied simulation, the abnormally high field surface pressure observed throughout the injection cycle can be attributed to higher perforation friction caused by an identified percentage of perforations disallowing injection.|","Document Type

Lower Silurian marine shale play in Sichuan Basin, Southwestern China has complicated geological features that involve highly heterogeneous and anisotropic rock properties, pre-existing natural fractures at multiple length scales, and faulting system. To produce gas from this shale play, we have encountered casing deformations that affect the implementation of multi-stage hydraulic fracturing stimulation program. During a multi-stage hydraulic fracturing stimulation, the stimulation may trigger significant variation of the in-situ stresses at any stage, which may cause casing deformations and the failure of the following fracturing stimulation. 
In this paper, we will present multi-disciplinary efforts to develop a quantitative understanding of the causes based on 6 casing deformation events. The diagnostic process starts with a large-scale pre-existing natural fracture mapping and faulting system from available seismic and log data. Next, we applied stress analysis and stimulated fracture network to evaluate the risk of casing deformation. As a conclusion, the main causes of the casing deformations are the shear slips of the large-scale natural fractures and the hydraulic fracture propagation from adjacent wells based on micro-seismic analysis and impression block with coiled tubing. 
We have further developed a numerical model that couples rock deformation, hydraulic fracture propagation and its interaction with natural fractures. With the consideration of the stress shadow created by hydraulic fracture propagation, the proposed numerical model has been applied to predict the variation of the formation stresses. This numerical model has been applied to predict the shear slips of natural fractures/faults during hydraulic fracturing stimulation. The simulation studies show that the orientation of natural faults, the distance between hydraulic fracture and natural fractures, net pressure, and wall friction coefficient of fractures are the main factors, which needs to be considered and optimized to avoid casing deformations. 
Based on this comprehensive study and diagnostics, we have proposed a guideline for hydraulic fracturing stimulation design and implementation in this region to prevent casing deformation. The consequent results are very encouraging in the prevention of casing deformation during multi-stage hydraulic fracturing stimulations.|","Document Type

This study presents a successful empirical approach based on the integration of numerous multidisciplinary measurements to optimize completion methodologies and future field development strategies for stacked lateral wellbores, and essentially to high-grade exploratory Wolfcamp landing zones from 3D seismic data. Specifically, we measured mineralogical and geomechanical shale properties directly from 3D surface seismic data lengthwise along lateral well trajectories at individual frac stages which were monitored real-time using microseismic acquisition. Linear regression analyses for calibration show strong correlations between inverted seismic P-wave impedance versus microseismic data and fracture pressure responses, shale mineralogy compositions, and geomechanical properties calculated from core data. 
The method was recently tested in the prolific oil-bearing Wolfcamp shale-oil play of the Midland Basin, West Texas, on three horizontal laterals drilled in a ""chevron pattern"", two of which in the deeper Wolfcamp B formation and the third in the Wolfcamp A. Real-time microseismic monitoring was used to observe the hydraulic fracturing treatments and the resulting heights and lateral extent. Although identical pumping schedules were initially intended for all three laterals stimulated in a ""zipper sequence"", with geometric stage placement, it became apparent during the treatments that microseismic height growth varied significantly across the given laterals within individual stages. 
The results of our combined analysis showed that microseismic fracture height variability is most influenced by changes in shale stratigraphy and subsequent mineralogy composition, without a definitive relationship with treatment injection rates. Optimal fracture heights were observed in landing areas with significant volume of calcite, characteristic of high Young's modulus and closure stress, variables which in turn were estimated from 3D seismic. For validation, production history of said laterals and numerous others in the field confirms a strong correlation between seismic P-wave impedance and initial 120 day cumulative oil in landing zones where high volume of calcite and hence brittleness exists.|",""

Microseismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing can be caused by a variety of pressure and mechanical effects, resulting in both ‘wet’ microseismic events directly associated with the hydraulic fracture network and potentially remote ‘dry’ events. Understanding the cause of the specific microseismic events is critical to standard interpretation of fracture geometry, to avoid overestimation of the fracture geometry by including dry events. Furthermore, differentiation of the event types is also important for source characterization interpretations of the fracture deformation. In this study, a geomechanical model is used to understand the conditions for generation of different types of events. Predictions of synthetic microseismicity from geomechanical modeling is also used to identify event types based on the hydraulic and stress conditions. The event classification is then used to study various microseismic attributes and test their practical application to differentiate events based on spatial/temporal microseismic characteristics, speed of growth away from the fracture initiation points, source mechanism and frequency-magnitude relationships.|","Document Type

The MMV has produced oil from Tertiary conventional reservoirs for over 80 years. 
The Near Field Exploration -NFE- team of Ecopetrol focused in 2014 in reviewing and testing additional Cretaceous objectives, for example SimitI, Tablazo, Rosablanca and La Luna Formations, in areas with presence of old oil fields, like Casabe and Tisquirama. 
For this activity, the Casabe-Kl well was drilled, and the initial results show opportunities for unconventional reservoirs in Tablazo Formation. 
The chromatographic data collected by GC Tracer ™ system, indicated a zone of condensate to dry gas. The Total Hydrocarbons data -THC- found in this interval was12%. 
Geochemical information, according to the samples from the well Casabe-199, located to 1,3 km to SW from the Casabe-Kl well, includes Type II Kerogen, TOC values between 4% and 9%, Vitrinite Reflectance (Ro%) between 0,95% to 1,35% and mineralogical composition dominated by carbonates and clays, where the carbonates – clay relation increased with the depth, shifting from a 50% – 50% to 90% – 10%. 
Considering the mechanical and geometrical conditions of the well and geomechanical analysis of this Formation, 70 ft. in the middle to lower section of the Tablazo was selected for a pilot hydraulic fracking, to verify the hydrocarbons flow and its properties. 
100 km. to the NE of the Casabe Field, in the Tisquirama production block, it is possible to identify the Tablazo Formation with some facial variations associated to an increase in the carbonate content, and a few different geochemical properties; for example TOC levels between 3% and 4%, and values of Vitrinite Reflectance (Ro%) between 0.8% and 1%, in the shallowest part of the block. 
The top of the Tablazo Formation in this block, according to the structural map, shows depths from 19000 ft. on the west side, to 10,000 ft. on the east area, indicating possible variations in thermal maturity of this unit, where they could be an oil source in the East side, and a gas source in the West side. 
With this kind of results, and the good stratigraphic continuity of the Tablazo Formation from the central to northern area of the MMV basin, it is possible to propose a 150 km. corridor as a shale play exploration target, in one area with good characteristics to make possible new unconventional fields in the mid-term, with major oil and gas facilities, historical relationship between the communities and the petroleum industry and the water sources available for the operations.|","Document Type

A geologically engineered shale completion optimization program was implemented for a liquid rich area of the Eagle Ford Play. This approach included detailed geological characterization, state-of-the-art unconventional 3D hydraulic fracture and reservoir flow modeling, as well as the latest available surveillance technology. This paper focuses on the integrated dataset used for optimizing unconventional completions. 
In the last decade, the United States has undergone an unconventional revolution fueled by the combination of horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing. Billions of dollars of capital investment are needed in unconventional resources and operators are competing to optimize developments and push for improved completion efficiency. 
With the pace of activity, ongoing learning curve, inherent uncertainty, and factory-mode mentality of operators, many shale well completions are sub-optimal with low fracture efficiency and a less than optimum reserves recovery. 
The push for completion and fracture optimization has prompted extensive learning projects to better understand the key drivers in fracture efficiency and the resulting production distribution along the horizontals. Recently, many innovative technologies have demonstrated significant promise to unlock greater potential within these wells. 
This paper will demonstrate a workflow for achieving completion optimization utilizing fiber optic DAS/DTS along with integrated modelling studies and complementary surveillance technologies such as tracers, production-logs, and micro-seismic. It will additionally provide examples of sub-optimized completions with low fracture efficiency, demonstrate the use of fiber optic DAS/DTS to improve overall completion efficiency, and outline the resulting production improvements achieved.|","Document Type

Located in the Argentinean Neuquen Basin, the Vaca Muerta formation is a thick succession of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous organic rich siliceous marlstones and mudstones with clay content below 30%. It is the main source rock of the reservoirs in the basin that have been producing since 1918. The El Trapial area is situated in the North West part of the basin. The Vaca Muerta formation is encountered at burial depth ranging from 2000–4200 m, and it extends over various thermal maturity windows in the study area from early oil to wet gas maturity windows. The organic-rich interval has a thickness of around 350 meters, with total organic carbon (""TOC"") ranging between 2 to 8% and average total porosity of 10%. Following the local maturity trends, hydrocarbon type has been found to vary laterally and presumably vertically. The maturity variations in the El Trapial area poses the challenge of understanding productivity drivers in the peak oil, late oil and gas condensate windows, with each maturity type potentially responding to different factors. 
A field study was initiated in 2011, analyzing resources with the available information (five wells with vintage logging suites and 80 percent of 3D seismic coverage), and then continued with a drilling campaign of four vertical exploratory wells with an aggressive data acquisition program. Full wireline log suites were run in the exploratory wells and more than 400 m of core was acquired. Laboratory studies were performed on conventional core, sidewall cores and cuttings samples to characterize the reservoir properties and to calibrate petrophysical and geomechanical models. 
Among the various petrophysical challenges offered by Vaca Muerta, the characterization of the porosity system is critical to understand the reservoir quality. Only considering the organic and inorganic pore systems brings into play many more questions regarding their respective contributions to oil production, in the early and late stages, and their relationship with potential formation water production. The NMR T2 distribution combined with laboratory data is the key to assess a better understanding of the pore system. 
The present work defines a new effective pore model for the El Trapial area to interpret the NMR T2D. The study relies on an extensive core measurement database and enables a improve prediction of the better productive zones in Vaca Muerta.|",""

The hazard associated with fluid injection induced seismicity is primarily because of pore pressure increase which can lead to fault slippage and triggering of earthquakes. Simple predictive models of induced seismicity have been recently developed to relate potential maximum magnitude of the seismicity to the volume of fluid injection (e.g., Shapiro et al., 2011; McGarr, 2014). However, the underlying simplifying assumptions in these models limit their general validity. We demonstrate how numerical modeling of pressure diffusion and geomechanics, coupled to simple modeling of seismic magnitude, can be used to validate such simplified models and provide better predictions of rock pressurization and the potential for induced seismicity. 
We conducted numerical simulation of fluid injection in synthetic scenarios for both shale hydraulic fracturing and wastewater injection operations. The objective was to study the critical characteristic of target reservoirs (e.g., permeability, stimulated rock volume, existence of conductive faults) for pore pressure increase, stress changes and estimation of moment magnitude of induced seismicity on hypothetical faults. This approach integrates a coupled flow-geomechanical simulation with an analytical model for estimating the magnitude of induced seismicity. 
Our results show how geological properties of target formations can have a strong effect on the potential of induced seismicity by controlling the spatial extent and magnitude of pore pressure disturbance. Geological properties of reservoirs are mainly responsible for how rapidly fluid is accepted and pore pressure increase dissipates with distance from the point of injection. 
While predictive models of induced seismicity are in early stages of development, it is important to understand the limits of their applicability for different scenarios. In particular, we demonstrate the need to include detailed pressure diffusion in predictive models linking fluid injection to induced seismicity.|","Document Type

Fine-grained mudrocks are enriched and/or depleted in a variety of major and trace elements, and the enrichment or depletion of these elements corresponds to specific depositional environments, sedimentary facies, mineralogy and provenance. Chemostratigraphy employs major and trace elemental data to understand geochemical variability within sedimentary sequences. Major elements (Al2O3, CaO, etc.) are used to describe primary lithologic variations while redox-sensitive trace elements (Mo, Ni, etc.) are used to infer paleodepositional environment. A comprehensive review has shown the geochemical dataset in this study has the ability to identify paleoredox facies changes (oxic to anoxic bottom-water conditions), where organic, carbon-rich intervals occur as a result of organic matter deposition and preservation, and variations in volume of clay (VClay) through identification of carbonate- rich and clay-prone facies. This dataset was used to elucidate vertical and lateral variations in lithologic facies and paleoredox conditions within the organic-rich Upper Cretaceous Eagle Ford Shale. 
Using a geomechanical dataset that consisted of open-hole logs and pre-stack seismic inversion products, petrophysical parameters and major and trace elemental data were further integrated with geomechanical data. Relationships were developed to estimate petrophysical parameters and major and trace elemental concentrations from geomechanical properties using forward stepwise regression, neural network analysis, principle component analysis (PCA), and unsupervised seismic facies classification. 3D models of specific geomechanical properties derived via pre-stack seismic inversion were used to predict key petrophysical parameters and elemental concentrations in a 3D volumetric sense. The resulting 3D volumes were used to identify the most prospective regions within the Eagle Ford Shale with high organic matter preservation and acceptable clay content.|",""

A geologically engineered shale completion optimization program was implemented for a liquid rich area of the Eagle Ford play. This approach included detailed geological characterization, state-of-the-art unconventional 3D hydraulic fracture and reservoir flow modeling, as well as the latest available surveillance technology. This paper focuses on the geological characterization of reservoirs which includes the generation of core-calibrated petrophysical and geomechanical rock properties as well as the natural fracture distribution. 
In the last decade, multistage completion in horizontal wells has successfully unlocked tremendous hydrocarbon resources in the onshore US. However, there are a large amount of wells which underperform due to oversimplified petrophysical and geomechanical property description, where reservoir heterogeneity is not properly represented. Low initial production rate is partially related to the poor uniformity among perforation clusters. Conventional subsurface reservoir description commonly involves the interpolation of core and log data acquired in pilot wells. The assumption of layer cake earth models from pilot wells can result in inaccurate reservoir property models for hydraulic fracture stimulation. 
Optimizing completion design requires acquiring and interpreting petrophysical and geomechanical properties along the horizontal well. Petrophysical properties include total organic content, porosity, permeability, gas-filled porosity and clay volume. Geomechanical parameters include minimum horizontal stress, Young's Modulus and Poisson's ratio. Alternative isotropic and anisotropic stress profiles of reservoirs and encasing rocks are used to simulate hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation as well as expected well performance. In addition to the later static properties, the density and orientation of natural fractures from borehole image and acoustic logs enhance the optimization workflow. This paper provides specific examples on how natural fractures and geological properties affect completion efficiency and production.

Several anomalous production phenomena have been observed in liquid-rich shale (LRS) oil wells, indicating that they are quite different from conventional oil wells. One of these unique phenomenon is flattened producing gas oil ratio (GOR) due to nano-darcy permeability of shale rocks and effects of pore proximity on phase behavior and fluid flow in nanoscale pores. To understand true production mechanisms and well production performance in these resources, it is crucial to account for the impact of nano-pores in fluid flow studies. 
This study discusses the impact of nano-pore confinement on PVT properties, transport properties, rock compaction, how these phenomena affect produced GOR of LRS oil wells, and how to incorporate these phenomena into reservoir modeling studies. Also, we have developed a methodology for modeling LRS oil wells that simulates GOR behavior accurately. 
The proposed methodology has been applied to construct a compositional simulation model using a single stage hydraulic fracture reservoir model with logarithmically-spaced local grid refinement (LS-LGR) grids. The effect of pore proximity on PVT is considered by introducing new correlations for modifying critical properties of fluid components in nano-pores. Production data from several horizontal wells in the Eagle Ford shale were used for history matching and model calibration. 
The study shows that ""flat"" GOR's in early stages of production are caused by delayed development of two-phase flow as a result of reduction of the bubble point pressure in nano-pores. Enhancement of critical gas saturation delays mobilization of gas molecules in nano-pores and could extend non-intuitive GOR behavior further when reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point. The study reveals that period of flat produced GOR depends on the volatility of the reservoir fluid and the pore size distribution in the reservoir. For moderate-GOR oil reservoirs, the flat GOR lasts longer than for highly volatile oil reservoirs. We found that permeability reduction due to compaction on can reduce ultimate oil recovery by more than 20%. 
This study explored several unique phenomena in LRS reservoirs and presents new correlations for reservoir fluid properties and phase behavior under confinement. These new correlations and the effects of nano-pores can be combined with numerical models to simulate better the performance of LRS oil reservoirs and to estimate EUR accurately.|","Document Type

Gas production from ultra-low permeable shale resources declines drastically at early times upon which organically rich undrained zones are still left at high gas content. In order to enhance nearly flat gas production rates, re-fracturing virgin zones using the newly emerged technologies has been widely implemented in the past few years. Therefore, numerical optimizing tools for re-fracturing must capture several production steps including the irreversible reservoir conditions; the depleted reservoir pressure and the associated fracturing fluid pore blockage close to hydraulic fractures. These have not been considered in the production models in the literature. 
In this paper, we introduce a multi-step production model including the geomechanics effects, followed by a detailed sensitivity analysis for the most influential parameters in gas production. A synthetic shale gas reservoir model is created with logarithmically spaced, locally refined grids (LS-LR-DK) inside the stimulated reservoir volume to accurately capture the physics of flow in shale gas reservoirs. This model consists of the following sequential steps: 1) production from the first set of hydraulic fractures and well shut-in at the re-fracturing time; 2) activation of the second set of hydraulic fractures induced by re-fracturing, and fracturing fluid (water) injection into all fractures to simulate the fracturing fluid invasion into the matrix; 3) fracturing fluid soaking period; and 4) production from the renovated fracture network (the new and old hydraulic fractures). This model provides a mechanistic approach to include and simulate the following obstacles in gas production enhancement using re-fracturing: 1) reservoir pressure depletion in the initially stimulated reservoir volume as the depleted reservoir pressure cannot strongly repel the invaded fracturing fluid out of the matrix; 2) deep fracturing fluid invasion due to the pressure depletion and the alteration of single phase flow to two phase flow. 
The results showed that the pressure depletion and the resultant water retainment in the pore space reduced the production enhancement by 5% compared to the base case without these effects. This modification in gas production can influence the risk assessments for further investment on re-fracturing a field yet producing at low rates, and may revise the number of considered fields for re-fracturing.|","Document Type

Enhanced initial and long-term recovery of hydrocarbons in nano-darcy permeability formations is dependent on a combination of exposed fracture surface area and maintained fracture connectivity. Several stimulation techniques have been developed and applied by stimulation service companies in order to achieve greater production by working to increase conductivity endurance in the proppant pack. Treatment schedules, however, vary little from well to well. Due to the varying geomechanical properties and micro-features observed across shale plays, laboratory testing is needed that instead evaluates the benefits of enhanced reservoir contact and fracture connectivity in specific reservoirs. 
In this paper we present a systematic approach to hydraulic fracture treatment design in the Wolfcamp formation, which takes advantage of the natural and induced fracture and pore connectivity in order to improve the production rate and help increase recoverable reserves. A series of petrophysical and geomechanical tests were done on Wolfcamp core sections in order to weigh the significance of proppant and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). 
Results of the study indicated that production is sustained in far field fractures packed with small proppant at very low concentrations. A bifurcating fracture slot was utilized to observe proppant transport and deposition deep into the fracture network indicating increased reservoir contact. X-ray micro computed tomography (micro-CT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of natural fractures and pores revealed the importance of fracture volume and pore cross-cutting in production longevity. 
The testing presented here is supported by the documented success of high fluid volume, slickwater treatments in the Permian basin. The specific geomechanical features of this formation combined with the extensive natural fracture network allows for the increased fluid volumes and lower proppant concentrations and sizes to effectively contact more reservoir and sustain far-field connectivity. Combining operational and experimental studies to weigh the significance of interconnected fractures and stimulated reservoir volume in low permeability formations has led to optimized treatment designs, increased production, and improved return on investment.|","Document Type

In recent years the Upper Bench of the Three Forks formation has proven to be a prolific development target in Divide County, North Dakota. Near the US/Canada border the Upper Bench is characteristic of properties demonstrating good reservoir quality. However, the interval is relatively thin (5-15') compared to producing intervals in the basin center (in excess of 30'). Given the moderate thickness of this zone and current production ranges seen to date, the recovery factor appears to be anomalously high compared to other analogous unconventional reservoirs. The underlying Middle Bench of the Three Forks reservoir may contribute to some minor extent but typically exhibits properties characteristic of much lower reservoir quality. Geochemical data collected from cuttings in the Lower Bakken Shale, directly above the upper bench of the Three Forks suggest that the shale is in the early stages of oil generation. The focus of this study is to test the hypothesis that a significant proportion of the production from horizontal wells targeting the Upper Three Forks Formation comes from the overlying Lower Bakken Shale. An attempt to demonstrate this is made through the interpretation of ion milled SEM images, comparison of isotope analyses of produced oils and Upper Bench extracts to that of Lower Bakken Shale samples, modeling of mechanical rock properties to derive a fracability index of the interval, and integration of geologic mapping from wireline logs, core data, and capillary pressure data. This study not only provides insight into the specific intervals contributing to hydrocarbon production in Three Forks wells in Divide County, but also provides a model for oil production contribution from source rocks adjacent to reservoirs in horizontal unconventional oil plays.|","Document Type

Organic-rich Kerogen of Lower Kimmeridgian to Upper Oxfordian age comprises of thinly laminated Kerogen with calcareous mudstone deposited in deep basinal environment. It has a consistent thickness of 50' in the entire study area with an average porosity of 4-6pu with nanodarcy permeability and is the main source for hydrocarbon plays in Kuwait. This rock sequence occurs at depths of 14000-15000 ft under HPHT conditions. Huge success of shale gas plays in North America has prompted the characterization of these source rocks to evaluate their resource play potential for the first time in Kuwait. 
The Kerogen under study differs from proven US Shale gas fields in terms of comparatively higher TOC content, greater depth and much less in thickness (50ft) and in a Pre-salt setting. Hence these are challenging in terms of completion and production. These are inferred to be Type II Oil & Gas prone based on Vitrinite reflectance range from 0.98 to 1.17. 
Tight rock analysis (TRA) and geo-mechanical studies of selected core samples within the study area provide critical input for Kerogen characterization. Kerogen is divisible into seven units based on electro-logs and log derived TOC and are correlatable with distinct facies assemblage, TRA derived petrophysical data and Geomechanical properties. Core derived UCS, Triaxial Compression test and Brazilian test based on lab results have brought out clear anisotropic behavior and enabled to bring out mechanical stratigraphy by integrating geomechanical properties and litho-facies variations within the Kerogen. This workflow has brought out the distinction of the carrier beds in alternations with Kerogen-rich layers as well as planned well trajectory along the carrier bed in the central part of Kerogen. Lastly, proppant compatibility tests combined with Young's Modulus provide valuable input for planning horizontal wells and subsequent hydro-frac design for completion.|","Document Type

We first review some of the definitions of brittleness index (BI) that have been used in the recent literature concerning oil and gas exploration and production from low porosity, low permeability rocks. We will then argue that the definitions characterizing the BI of rocks either by their elastic properties, by their mineralogical composition or by their strength characteristics, are all equivalent and typically result in a higher BI assigned to quartz-rich rocks than to clay-rich lithologies. Therefore the majorities of recent definitions of BI are simply a rock- type indicator and are useful as such. However, the separation of rocks into brittle/ductile lithologies on the basis of a calculated BI is not necessarily an indicator of brittle or ductile failure during hydraulic stimulation. We therefore propose that brittleness index is potentially an unfortunate choice of words and can, at worst, be misleading. We will then show how incorporation of elastic and strength properties into a geomechanical model, which additionally includes the stress state and pore pressure, can be used to determine (i) whether hydraulic fractures are likely to be contained in the resource layer and or will grow out of zone (ii) whether rock fails predominantly in tension or in shear during hydraulic stimulation, and (iii) whether hydraulic stimulation will predominantly create new fractures or is likely to re-activate pre-existing fractures and other planes of weakness (such as bedding boundaries).|","Document Type

For many unconventional reservoirs, interpretation of subsurface geology alone can be inadequate for determining reservoir potential. As a result, seismic data have not been as fully utilized as they could be. This paper presents a study that leverages multivariate classification methods to integrate core, log and seismic data for the propagation of material properties across two intersecting 2D seismic lines in the Lublin Basin, Poland. 
In this study, classification of wireline logs is used to isolate zones of expected similar or different material properties. These classes are then integrated with core data in order to determine which classes are most favorable from both a reservoir quality and completion quality perspective (ability to stimulate), based on the large assortment of core measurements. Following characterization of the classification model at log scale, the collection of pre-stack inverted seismic attributes from each 2D line was trained at the near-well traces to recognize the classes provided by an upscaled version of the log-derived classification model. Once the training rules were determined, they were applied to the full 2D data in order to propagate the classes away from the wellbore, and by extension the estimation of all the material properties integrated with the classes from the core measurements. 
Within the study region, one training well near the intersection of two 2D lines was used. This training well was on the down-thrown block of a large fault identified on one of the lines. Application of the training rules to the seismic attributes on the up thrown block across the fault shows that the up thrown block likely contains a new set of classes (and hence new and uncharacterized material properties) largely different from those available to train the model from the single available well and core. This integrated approach also showed that there is significant vertical and lateral heterogeneity in this portion of the Lublin Basin and that multivariate classification can be an effective means to integrate, scale and propagate material properties through a basin, even with limited available seismic data.|","Document Type

Because of the low permeability in shale plays, closely spaced hydraulic fractures and multilateral horizontal wells are generally required to improve production. Therefore, understanding the potential fracture interaction and stress evolution is critical in optimizing fracture/well design and completion strategy in multi-stage horizontal wells. 
In this paper, a novel fully coupled reservoir flow and geomechanics model based on the dual-lattice system is developed to simulate multiple non-planar fractures propagation. The numerical model from Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to simulate the mechanics of fracture propagations and interactions, while a conjugate irregular lattice network is generated to represent fluid flow in both fractures and formation. The fluid flow in the formation is controlled by Darcy's law, but within fractures it is simulated by using cubic law for laminar flow through parallel plates. Initiation, growth and coalescence of the microcracks will lead to the generation of macroscopic fractures, which is explicitly mimicked by failure and removal of bonds between particles from the discrete element network. 
We investigate the fracture propagation path in both homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs using the simulator developed. Stress shadow caused by the transverse fracture will change the orientation of principal stress in the fracture neighborhood, which may inhibit or alter the growth direction of nearby fracture clusters. However, the initial in-situ stress anisotropy often helps overcome this phenomenon. Under large in-situ stress anisotropy, the hydraulic fractures are more likely to propagate in a direction that is perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress. Under small in-situ stress anisotropy, there is a greater chance for fractures from nearby clusters to merge with each other. Then, we examine the differences in fracture geometry caused by fracturing in cemented or uncemented wellbore. Moreover, the impact of intrinsic reservoir heterogeneity caused by the rock fabric and mineralogy on fracture nucleation and propagation paths is examined through a three-layered reservoir. Finally, we apply the method to a realistic heterogeneous dataset.|","Document Type

Conventional methods for analysis of two-phase flow in reservoirs, with underlying simplifying assumptions, are generally not applicable for unconventional Liquid Rich Shale (LRS) oil reservoirs. These reservoirs exhibit multiple PVT systems and complex rock-fluid properties in nano-pores due to pore size effects. It is crucial to understand the production mechanisms and controlling rock and fluid parameters that impact long term production performance to efficiently manage LRS resources and to forecast the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery accurately. 
We have conducted comprehensive reservoir numerical simulation studies to investigate the impact of rock and fluid properties and production conditions on the performance of LRS oil wells. We used a compositional simulator to model fluid flow in the matrix and in hydraulic fractures. Logarithmic local grid refinement in the matrix allowed us to track pressure and fluid saturation changes accurately. Matrix grids were divided into nano-pores and macro pores based on pore size distributions reported for the Bakken play. Separate phase behaviors, rock compaction and relative permeability systems were assigned to each pore system based on pore sizes to account for the impact of nano-pores on reservoir performance. We used a wide range of fracture, matrix and fluid properties in several cases. 
The results show that the use of multiple relative permeability, rock compaction and PVT systems for different types of pores accurately represent the fluid flow behavior of LRS oil reservoirs, in which gas production and GOR trends remain stable for long times. We found that confined phase behavior and fracture spacing impact the initial oil rate while ultimate oil recovery is affected by flowing BHP, fracture geometry, initial solution gas oil ratio and relative permeability. Well productivity is sensitive to pore size distribution, especially for highly volatile reservoir fluids, but is not significantly affected by propped fracture permeability. Our study revealed that areas beyond the stimulated zone are likely to play only a limited role in overall hydrocarbon production and that completion design and production scenarios can significantly affect short-term production. 
The study explored the factors that have the biggest impact unconventional oil reservoir production. The results of the study enhance our understanding of fluid flow and performance of LRS oil wells and should help the industry to improve field planning and management.|","Document Type

The application of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing has boosted economic recoveries from unconventional reservoirs. Applying this technology requires proper placement of horizontal wells combined with hydraulic stimulation to create fractures extending from the horizontal wellbore. The economics of unconventional plays can be improved if horizontal wellbores target facies with favorable reservoir and geomechanical properties. An integrated, multi-disciplinary approach has been developed in order to reduce economic risk, facilitate improved and faster decision making and enable more efficient and effective well placement. 
Subsurface volumes of lithofacies, reservoir rock properties and geomechanical properties, all of which honor data from multiple disciplines, provided the means to generate lithology and property maps, including Phi-H, together with associated measurements of uncertainty for selected facies and properties. This seismically-constrained geomodeling approach enabled optimum identification of sweet spots for reservoir development and well placement. The methodology demonstrates the value of incorporating stratigraphic, geological, petrophysical, engineering and geophysical data into an integrated subsurface reservoir model.|","Document Type

In the last four years, shale oil and gas play exploration activity in the Vaca Muerta Formation, Neuquen Basin, Argentina; has increased rapidly from a couple of drilled exploration wells in 2010 to more than 135 wells up to December 2014. This large amount of wells drilled in this short term, led to the necessity of a strong play characterization program that included seismic reprocessing, well log data acquisition, core acquisition and interpretation, micro seismic acquisition programs and a highly detailed geological modelling workflow. One of the key issues regarding the productivity behaviour of the wells drilled for this type of play, are among others, the mechanical properties of the formation. In this paper, the estimation of such as properties are done by integrating the data from a simultaneous AVO inversion with a rock mechanic template calibrated with production and log data. 
The main objective of this work is the characterization of the exploration shale oil play, Vaca Muerta formation from a geomechanical point of view. The study began with the estimation of the dynamic Poisson's ratio and Young Moduli in the exploratory wells, calibrated in the lab using core samples of this formation. In order to obtain a complete suite of elastic properties, the Lame constants (?? and µ?) were estimated. The integration of these elastic properties enables to build a rock mechanis template (RMT), where different fields within this template were defined regarding organic richness and mechanical behaviour of the unit. Finally, the conclusions showed that the most fragile and organically rich field of the template, matched with the best production zone. 
Once the analysis on wells was concluded, the same workflow was applied to 3D seismic (using a simultaneous inversion result), to obtain volumes of predicted geomechanical properties. The RMT and its fields defined in wells were applied to the seismic volume, in order to obtain a three-dimensional evaluation of those fields. This integration helped to define a new exploratory strategy in the study area.|","Document Type

Understanding how stratigraphic and sedimentologic heterogeneity is reflected in wireline logs and seismic attributes is crucial to predict areas of better reservoir development in tight oil plays. This study explores the predictive capability of an integrated geologic, petrologic, petrophysical and geophysical model based on detailed facies analysis of thirteen sediment cores expanded over 400 wireline log suites and 440 square miles of 3D seismic in the western Powder River Basin, Wyoming. 
The integrated model is focused on the upper Cretaceous (Turronian) Wall Creek member of the Frontier Formation which varies in thickness from <10m to 60m across this area, and contains a complex assembly of lithofacies, ranging from fine-grained mudstones to coarse grained sandstones, with the latter forming the legacy conventional reservoir facies. A total of twelve distinct core facies and three sub-facies were identified based on grain size, physical and biogenic sedimentary features, ichnology, and petrology. 
Propagation of the core facies at wireline log resolution across a geographically significant and well resolved area was accomplished by employing a principle component analysis technique utilizing standard wireline log suites. The initial twelve core facies were upscaled to nine uniquely identified log (electro) facies based upon their statistical occurrence within each individual log facies. 
Log facies were subsequently upscaled again into six seismic facies based upon elastic parameters. Favorable elastic and geomechanical properties distinctly correlate to net pay facies derived by wireline logs which in turn correlate to coarser-grained sandstone facies. A simultaneous, geostatistical, prestack seismic inversion was conducted on a 3D seismic volume and probability volumes of encountering each seismic facies in addition to a most likely seismic facies volume were analyzed. 
The fully integrated results from core to log to seismic facies along with 3D seismic inversion-derived reservoir parameters calibrated to well control offer an added geologic comprehension of the stratigraphic architecture and reservoir distribution in the Wall Creek member as well as highlighting areas of better reservoir development potential thereby demonstrating the significant value of this integrated approach.|","Document Type

After experiencing massive lost circulation in an exploratory well in Colombia, it became necessary to drill without returns and stop the job upon various occasions of waiting for water. Upon completion of the job, water uptake limits were exceeded and various community relation issues were encountered, increasing both operational costs and nonproductive time (NPT). By the next well, the operator decided to develop a strategic plan to drill the well with the same scenario in the same location, but using a comprehensive strategy to help reduce the volume of water uptake while managing community relations and associated costs. The operator achieved a drill section in the well from the surface to 2,800 total ft, without additional water uptake, in less time. The logistical plan was executed in the field successfully, complying with the allowable uptake water permitted by the licensure without exceeding uptake limits. No NPT or health, safety, or environmental (HSE) incidents occurred during operations. No penalties or breaches of licensure were committed. No damage to the environment occurred. The community felt fulfilled that operational management protected its resources and the operator achieved a savings of nearly USD one million compared to the previous well. This strategy allowed analyzing a drilling fluid system alternative involving the use of aerated fluids to improve the operation and minimize the necessity to uptake water. The logistical plan developed helped build structures that currently support the operations of nearby wells, providing operational savings to execute drilling operations in the same area. Using the lessons learned from this operation, the operator successfully drilled two additional wells in the same area, implementing similar strategies (use of aerated fluids system) and complying with outlined environmental regulations. This helped the operator reduce operational costs. All personnel involved during operations were mindful of environmental impact and the importance of compliance with outlined environmental regulations.|","Losses, Strategy, Environment, Piedemonte, Economy"

The industry faces a number of challenges related to breathing air systems. Most high capacity breathing air systems typically have a large footprint and take up valuable real estate in an already crowded facility. Some operations require breathing air to support a large number of people simultaneously. Conventional cascade systems need to be replaced frequently with new, full cascades. This increases congestion and can potentially shut down work while the units are swapped out. There is also a high potential for costly accidents during transportation and when lifting cascades off the ground to elevated locations. 
Conventional low volume breathing air solutions have very limited flexibility. This is a case study of a compact ten ft. by ten high pressure breathing air system that holds up to 68,000 standard cubic feet (scf) of breathing air. It was designed to enable fill-in-place technology. It also has high pressure lines that distributed breathing air to workers at elevated worksites. Through the fill-in-place technology, the system was able to eliminate work disruptions during air replacement. The cascade was refilled even as far as 300 ft away while personnel were using the system. 
This case study presents an analysis of conventional and newer breathing air solutions and discusses in detail the significance of this innovation on how to deal with limitations and challenges facing the industry today. The case study outlines how to make facilities safer and more efficient by minimizing downtime, improving tool time and maintaining worksite safety at the highest possible levels.|","low pressure continuous flow breathing air system, industrial safety, Innovation, breathing air, high pressure air system"

For more than twenty years, Seismic surveys have been changing both in the incorporation of environmental and biodiversity criteria as well as in its implementation and performance indicators. The 3D seismic survey in the block 57 located in the tropical Andes, lower basin of the Urubamba river, has incorporated new techniques to minimize direct, secondary and cumulative impacts, focusing on each phase of the exploratory project. The technology used for data acquisition was made through the Geospace Seismic Recorder (GSX), which is a cableless seismic acquisition system that does not need a white house in seismic lines. This made possible the reduction of flying hours to transport materials, as well as a lower fuel consumption and clearing areas of flying camps and drop zones. 
The effluent treatment was one of the greatest challenges, due to the environmental standards set for dumping. In the base camp, additionally to the implementation of a wastewater treatment plant(conventionally used in other projects), it was necessary to complement it with previous processes by the use of equalization tanks and with subsequent processes using sedimentation cameras, flocculation and high rate filtration. During the topography and advanced studies, each group was assistedwith specialized personnel for the identification of Biologically Sensitive Areas (BSA) as well as forest survey prior to deforestation. In spite of the difficulty of the terrain and the predominance of the bamboo (Guadua spp.), seismic lines had a maximum width of 1.5 meters andrespected trees of more than 10 cm DBH. Biologically Sensitive Areas (BSA) were identified and avoided in the flying camps, heliports, seismics lines and drop zones. 
Abandonment activities considered primarily the natural regeneration of the forest. Residual wood from deforestation and flying camps were chopped on average of 0.3 <U+00D7> 0.45 <U+00D7> 0.20 meters in order to promote its decomposition. In addition, compacted soil was loosed on the areas intervened. The use of similar species that were reported in the forestry survey was also considered. For this purpose a greenhouse with 230 seedlings on average was installed in each camp from the beginning until the abandonment, and certified seed of native forest species: Amasisa (Erythrina ulei), Huairuro (Ormosia coccinea), Pachaco (Parkia multijuga), Bolaina (Guazuma crinita) Copaiba (Copaifera paupera) was also used. In the case of drop zones located in lines nearby, samples were used to the area.|","3D Seismic, Biodiversity, Environment"

Soria, Compania Operadora de Gas del Amazonas","|Abstract 
The Camisea Pipeline Transportation System (PTS) crosses along three regions clearly differentiated in its 730 Km: forest, mountains and coast. Each of them has particular high social sensitivity and biolgocial diversity. 
During pipeline operation and maintenance, different wastes are generated which must be disposed of in authorized sanitary or security landfills. There are not many and are remotely located from the generation points. 
Waste management from remote generation points to authorized places involve a challenge from the logistic viewpoint, time, social and environmental responsibility, mainly due to the fact that operations in the forest are carried out under offshore conditions: carrying by air personnel, materials and wastes, thus complying with the access control plan of highly sensitivie social and environmental sectors of native communities, thus achiving compliance with the highest international standards related to the project. 
Management of wastes at different work sites of the Right of Way starts with proper seggregation at the source. They are classified, labelled and registered, and then, they are transported to one of the 5 central storages strategically located along the three working sectors. Several air and/or land transportation means are used to move over 900 tons of hazardous and non hazardous wastes generated in the project. 
An important factor implemented in waste management is compacting, which allowed for a reduction of over 30% of wastes transported, resulting in savings for the company. 
Reception and conditioning in central storages follow safety and occupational health guidelines that allow to guarantee risk minimization and prevention. 
Another strategy implemented as part of waste minimization is the implementation of fertilizing latrines, used in remote areas to take advantage of waste water in organic matter environmentally usable. 
Initiatives were implemented for reusing almost all organic wastes by transforming compost, reducing by 90% said waste, together with community development projects by using compost as raw material in agricultura in the areas of influence of the company.|","Challenges, Camisea PerA<U+00BA>, Waste management, Remote sites"

The Yasuni National Park is located in the Ecuadorian Amazon. It is the most important reservoir of biodiversity on the planet and home to two peoples in voluntary isolation: the Tagaeri and Taromenane. Below the ground of this park are three oil fields that contain approximately 20% of the country's oil reserves. For these reasons, NOC Petroamazonas EP performed detailed environmental impact studies, with the mandate to use proven technologies to develop the reserves of these fields. Based on this, a drill cutting reinjection feasibility study was conducted in the Apaika field within Yasuni Park. 
This paper presents the results of the feasibility study in which all aspects of geoscience and operations parameters that influence the selection of the optimal formation and well injection were integrated: geology, petrophysical, geomechanical, fracture simulations, slurry design, interference analysis, injection rates, well completion, erosion velocities, etc. 
The geology and petrophysical analysis included seal analyses to help ensure the containment of slurry (outcrops, natural fractures, and faults), storage (lateral continuity, thickness, effective porosity, clay volume, water saturation, and pore throat radius), and flow properties. Filtrate invasion simulations were conducted considering the volume of drilling waste planned in the field and the maximum volume that could be injected into the formation without affecting neighboring wells (areal interference) and without resulting in fluid loss to formations of interest (vertical interference). Fracture simulations were supported by geomechanical models and calibrated with real-time results in the field. Also, laboratory tests were performed to obtain the optimal slurry. Finally, tubing erosion velocity, casing burst failures, and surface equipment analyses were performed to assess the integrity and condition of the injector well, Apaika 001X. 
Implementing drill cutting reinjection feasibility studies in Apaika 001X provided Petroamazonas EP with a definitive solution to the waste accumulation at the surface, helping to minimize the environmental impact in the Apaika field and also to prepare for operations in Yasuni, which is a bigger challenge. Following the recommendations of the feasibility study, a diagnostic formation integrity test (DFIT) was performed in April 2014 to calibrate the geomechanical model. Cuttings were first injected into Apaika 001X in June 2014, making it the first drilling waste reinjector well in Ecuador supported by best practices.|","cutting, reinjection, feasibility, environment, study"

The paper has not been peer reviewed. |Constructing and refining complex reservoir models are challenging and time-consuming tasks that entail a high degree of uncertainty. Conventional modeling work flows have remained essentially unchanged for the past decade. Such work flows are poorly suited to rapid prototyping of a range of reservoirmodel concepts, well trajectories, and development options and to testing of how these might affect reservoir behavior. A new reservoir-modeling and -simulation approach, termed rapid reservoir modeling (RRM), allows such prototyping and complements existing work flows. |Introduction |Hydrocarbon reservoirs typically contain an array of complex geologic heterogeneities that are at or below the resolution of seismic data, so their geometry and spatial distribution are uncertain. These heterogeneities may be structural, stratigraphic, sedimentologic, or diagenetic in origin and often affect flow behavior and hydrocarbon recovery; hence, they must be captured in reservoir models. Reservoir-modeling work flows have remained essentially unchanged for the past decade, facilitated by commercially available software packages. These work flows begin with the construction of a geocellular reservoir model, in which a largely deterministic structural and stratigraphic framework is used to define the overall reservoir volume, and compartments and zones within the reservoir. A grid is then constructed within each zone, typically using pillars that are continuous from the top to the base of the modeled volume, and using layers that may vary in thickness or be truncated by reservoir-zone boundaries. Geostatistical methods are used to populate each grid cell with a geologic indicator (such as facies or rock type) and associated petrophysical properties. The resulting models typically contain several millions to tens of millions of cells and may be upscaled onto a coarser grid before flow simulation. Despite its wide use, there are a number of shortcomings with this work flow, including |Conventional modeling workflows are slow, often requiring many months from the development of initial model concepts to flow simulation or other outputs. |Conceptual geologic models become fixed early in the modeling process, with uncertainty explored using geostatistical methods within the framework of a single conceptual model, rather than across a range of possible geologic concepts. |It is difficult or impossible to explore rapidly a range of conceptual models, well trajectories, and development options and test how these might affect reservoir behavior. |The introduction of pillar grids early in the modeling workflow limits the spatial resolution of the model and the complexity of the geologic architectures that can be captured and focuses modeling efforts on population of gridblocks with rock properties by use of geostatistical modeling methods. |Geostatistical methods are often nonintuitive and require inputs that are not closely linked to the underlying geologic concept, so it can be difficult for the geologist to create a digital version of the model concept. |Integration across different disciplines is made more difficult by the use of different software tools and by different model grid types and resolutions. |The aim of this work is to develop RRM software for prototyping of complex reservoir models, well trajectories, and development options by means of novel, sketch-based interaction and modeling coupled with exploratory visualization and close-to-real-time numerical analysis. The new approach does not replace existing work flows; rather, it supplements them by allowing rapid testing of geologic and development concepts and how these affect reservoir behavior.|","Document Type

However, that research included simplified models that reflected natural and hydraulic fractures -only, unlike real shale reservoirs. To develop an accurate shale-gas model, this study considers the effects of rejuvenated fractures as well as natural and hydraulic fractures. Rejuvenated fractures, regarded as an important specificity in this paper, are revitalized natural fractures created by hydraulic fracturing. To analyze the pressure-transient characteristics and productivity of fractured horizontal wells in shale reservoirs, extensive numerical simulations have been conducted. This model considers the effects of natural- and rejuvenated-fracture permeability, matrix permeability, parameters of hydraulic fractures (e.g., width, height, and half-length), and the range of stimulated reservoir volume. Results show a clear distinction between existing models and the proposed model. In the proposed model, the boundary induced by the rejuvenated fractures generates pseudoboundary-dominated flow.

The paper has not been peer reviewed. |Simulation of coupled flow and geomechanics is of rising importance as unconventional subsurface exploration pushes the operational envelope of geological media. Coupling schemes are commonly assigned to three categories: decoupled, iteratively coupled, and fully coupled. This paper focuses on iterative coupling and presents a new coupling scheme: full pressure coupling (FPC). Here, the geomechanics is solved fully coupled to a single-phase-flow problem using global pressure, and the resulting deformation is iteratively coupled to a multiphase multicomponent flow solver. |Introduction |Geomechanical response to fluid flow is important for several subsurface applications. Historically, geological subsidence has been seen as a response to petroleum production and a result of groundwater production. Recently, coupling of flow and geomechanics has received renewed attention, in the context of ground level uplift associated with the In Salah CO2- storage site and in the context of hydraulic fracturing for the purposes of enhancing geothermal systems and shale-gas production. The authors note a trend away from considering systems where a geomechanical response may be important toward using the geomechanical coupling directly in the engineering design. Simultaneously, there is a need for more-robust algorithms for handling strongly coupled hydromechanical systems. |The traditional approach to addressing coupled flow and mechanics uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, wherein the flow and mechanical systems are solved separately and coupled either loosely or through iterations. This strategy is motivated in part by the availability of established and robust commercial software for both multiphase flow and mechanical deformation. Although some of these coupled approaches can be shown to be stable and convergent, it is generally desirable to consider a tighter coupling between flow and mechanics. |When considering multiphase flow and deformation, the mathematical structure of the problem implies three main components: mechanical deformation, the fluid pressure equation, and mass transport. The traditional splitting algorithms propose to iterate between solving the mechanical system and then solving the pressure and transport systems together. However, the success of algorithms such as implicit pressure with explicit saturation/mass/component implies that pressure and transport are only weakly coupled. Consequently, this paper proposes a new splitting approach to multi phase flow and geomechanics, wherein the mechanical and pressure systems are solved together and iterate with the transport system. Thus, the pressure and mechanics are fully coupled. |Please see the complete paper for the model equations, the reformulation of the equations to obtain the full-pressure- coupling splitting, and the formulation of a discrete version of those equations using finite volumes and treating pressure and deformations implicitly and masses explicitly (FV-ImPDEM). |Illustrative Examples |Simple examples that are characteristic for CO2-storage scenarios illustrate the FV-ImPDEM algorithm. The chosen material properties are given in Table 1. The Young’s modulus is on the soft limit of sandstone, to illustrate the coupling effect. Also, the compressibilities of the fluids in most reservoirs are an order of magnitude smaller and the density of CO2 is normally not obtained for pure CO2. Also, note that the grains of the rock are assumed to be incompressible and all the compressibility of the rock is obtained through changing the packing of the grains.|","Document Type

Vermilion, the biggest producer in the area, undertook in 2012 a basinwide well-integrity risk-management project with the goal of understanding and minimizing the risk of freshwater-aquifer pollution. The Paris basin operations include 20 fields, for a total of 289 active wells, more than half of which were drilled in the 1980s. The objectives of the leakage risk assessment are two-fold: First, identify high-risk scenarios and ""must act"" wells that require immediate intervention; second, adopt lean (i.e., eliminating waste) prevention and mitigation measures that satisfy the local regulator. The risk-assessment methodology is based on scenarios (i.e., ways in which the hazards, brines or hydrocarbons, can cause damage to targets, the freshwater aquifers). Each scenario involves the failure of a number of barriers with the function to prevent or mitigate damage. In this approach, evidence from in-depth failure analysis is used to build and calibrate scenarios, as well as to validate degradation mechanisms and understand their dynamics. Evidence considered is not limited to drilling reports and wireline logs, but includes all observations, measurements, and weak signals that one can use to test assumptions on the presence, absence, or aging of well integrity. Evidence-based scenarios are complemented by known failure mechanisms, thus reducing the risk of ""black swans,"" very improbable but catastrophic events, even though their probability is constrained by observed behavior during the 4,000 well years of operations in the basin. The criticality (product of probability and severity) of each applicable scenario is then computed by use of an exhaustive database of the characteristics of each well, resulting in a complete risk profile for the basin. The risk-assessment process revealed that casing corrosion caused by brine injection is the biggest driver of well-integrity risk; it also allowed tailoring effective prevention and mitigation actions: For instance, the criticality of scenarios is reduced to an acceptable level if the time between tubing failure and injection stop is kept to 3 months or less. Furthermore, the analysis helps define the role of periodic logging and thus reduce possible waste (i.e., actions that do not contribute to understanding, preventing, or mitigating risk). The evidence-based approach, since applied to another French basin, has proved effective for managing risk at the basin level, by cutting a middle way between universal checklists and the excessively narrow focus of well-by-well analysis: The former are too large and hazy and may hide real dangers among hardly applicable generalities, whereas the latter tends to be expensive and unsystematic and misses recurring patterns. Heavy-duty analytics and modeling are used most efficiently on focused and specific failure analyses to understand the dominant phenomena, which one can then use to paint a quantitative and consistent picture at the level of a field or basin.|","aquifer protection, scenarios, well integrity, evidence-based approach, risk management"

Since this discovery, many more hydrothermal vent occurrences have been discovered in the deep ocean. These vents are associated with compact high grade copper, gold, and zinc deposits that are being actively explored for by national and private organizations. |Exploration for these deposits usually begins with ship borne sonar mapping and towed water chemistry samplers. From bathymetric maps, potential targets for more detailed mapping with underwater vehicles are defined. Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mounted turbidity, pH, and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) sensors, magnetometers, electromagnetic (EM) systems, high-resolution multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetry, sidescan sonar and subbottom profiler surveys are used to delineate the extent and nature of the submarine massive sulfide (SMS) deposits. |EM surveying can be used to determine the resistivity of near-surface and subsurface structure. SMS deposits fall into two categories; zinc rich non-conductive and conductive copper-gold deposits. One system is an ROV-mounted EM system that operates near the seafloor (Kowlaczyk, 2008). It comprises a transmitter coil wrapped around the ROV and an electric field sensor mounted close to the ROV. This system has successfully mapped high-conductivity zones corresponding to high grades of copper and gold. This system has detected blind mineralization at a depth of several meters, but does not penetrate beyond five or ten meters into the ocean floor. It does outline the limits of the system accurately, and has been used to direct resource-definition drilling of SMS deposits. |Modelling shows that buried SMS deposits can be mapped using a controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) system. A CSEM system consists of an electrical transmitter and one or more electric field receivers that are either on the seafloor or towed behind the transmitter. SMS deposits are conductive and will channel electrical current. Since the conductivity of the ocean is constant, electrical fields are a proxy for current density. Modelling shows that SMS targets produce a readily detectable electrical field anomaly. Using 3D inversion of the CSEM electrical field data, subsurface SMS deposits can be mapped. |SMS deposits can also be mapped using seismic methods. The depth of water and the deposit geometry make it difficult to deploy standard systems. A new system using a vertical cable array and a surface source has successfully mapped SMS deposits in 3D. |This paper will review the use of EM and seismic methods successfully used to map SMS deposits.|","Electromagnetics, magnetic survey, mining, 3D Seismic, black smoker"

The MEM encapsulates several information related to pore pressure, mechanical properties of the reservoir rock, the geometry of the reservoir limits and the overburden and the stress regime. Various workflows were proposed to build and update the MEM. However, those approaches do not incorporate the complexity of the carbonate rocks.

Surface movement over a Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) operation can be related to production and injection. The amount and location of surface change can indicate the location of thermal dilation within the reservoir and may provide an indication of conformance. While the deformation expected in a SAGD operation is related to the depth of the reservoir and the stratigraphy, the typical ground movement is approximately 2-5 cm/year. This represents a relatively slow inflationary process over the ground. The movement may be confused with changes that are related to seasonal ground changes including water level changes in muskeg, for instance. 
This work provides a description of the accuracy of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurement techniques including corner reflectors and advanced point and neighbourhood algorithms designed for the measurement of ground movement in Northern Alberta. The paper will describe the application of these methods to measuring surface movement above a SAGD operation. Specifically, this article describes methods for the determination of the accuracy of ground movement estimates as derived from InSAR. An effective survey design is critical to the monitoring of ground movement. The location and availability of measurement points is crucial to the use of high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites for monitoring. The design and implementation of a survey includes an understanding of the relationship between available infrastructure and the ground signal to be expected. However, a critical aspect of monitoring is a verification of the accuracy of the measurement provided. By using repeated observations and even a combination of satellites, we show how the measurement of accuracy can be provided on an operational basis.

Li et al. (2004) described three zones at the edge of steam chambers based on drainage conditions: 1. drained, 2. partially drained, and 3. undrained. In the drained zone, the pore pressure is controlled by injection pressure and fluid mobility within this region is sufficient to drain additional pore pressures due to shear dilation and pore fluid thermal expansion. The undrained zone lies beyond the partially drained zone and extends to virgin reservoir far beyond the chamber. In this zone shearing behaves under undrained condition; by this they mean no volume change occurs but shear lead to changes in pore pressure. Li et al. (2004) proposed that the boundaries of these zones are based on bitumen viscosity which relates to the temperature distribution beyond the steam interface. Since drained/undrained conditions impact the geomechanics at the edge of the chamber, we investigate whether Li et al.’s assumption that there is no volume change within the sheared zone is correct and is supported by field data. Here, we establish the physics associated with the undrained zone at the edge of SAGD steam chamber and explore the pressure front versus temperature front of different oil sand field projects. The results reveal that the drained zone governed by pressure front advancement is greater in extent than the sheared zone.. The thermodynamics of the undrained zone is discussed to derive a new theory for mechano-thermal phenomena at the edge of the chamber. The results from the theory show that the drained zone extends beyond the temperature front and thus, from a geomechanical point of view, the system solely consists of the drained and partially drained zones.|","Undrained, Enhanced Permeability, Drained, SAGD"

Steam Assistant Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is widely used to recover heavy oil and bitumen reservoirs. Typical SAGD operations involve a pair of horizontal wells separated vertically. Steam, or a steam-solvent mixture (e.g., Expanding- Solvent SAGD), is injected into the upper well to form a steam chamber and mobilize oil, which drains to the lower production well. Significant mechanical stresses associated with this process can increase the risk of fracturing the reservoir, or cap-rock. We perform a fully-coupled thermal-compositional-mechanical numerical simulation of SAGD and ES-SAGD processes for a typical bitumen reservoir in the Fort McMurray region of Alberta, Canada. A mixed finite-volume approximation for the flow and a Galerkin finite-element approximation for the mechanics are used, and the resulting set of nonlinear equations are solved using a fully implicit formulation. The two discretizations share the same unstructured grid. We demonstrate that thermo-mechanical effects can be quite significant in SAGD operations. The sharper gradients associated with the standard SAGD process increase the risk of damaging of the cap-rock. On the other hand, ES-SAGD operations lead to more dispersed temperature and pressure distributions, which decreases the possibility of damaging the cap-rock.|","geomechanics, cap-rock damage, thermomechanics, SAGD, thermal stresses"

Murphy has commenced horizontal CSS at Cadotte (Seal Lake, Peace River Oilsands). Cadotte is an unconventional reservoir due to compositional gradient, faulting, water pockets, and variations in oil viscosity, rock dilation/fracturing and pay-zone thickness. Gravity and viscosity are marked by declining quality with depth, biodegradation and compartmentalization. 
High oil viscosity and low water mobility at Cadotte cause low initial injectivity. High injectivity during CSS is achieved by high pressure injection to fail the formation mechanically and trigger fracturing and deformation (dilation-recompaction triggers relative permeability hysteresis). Evidence of dilation at Cadotte includes greater steam injectivity than is expected and surface uplifts (larger than can be attributed to thermal expansion/tensile fracturing). 
History-matching high injectivities is challenging when reasonable fracture lengths/rock compressibilities are used. To match injectivities, most simulations (Cold Lake/California CSS) have either used larger compressibility (‘spongy-rock’ approach) or long fractures. Spongy-rock approach predicts a steady increase in injection pressure, whereas in early cycles pressures increase and then level off for most of the cycle. 
We describe enhancements made to a commercially-available simulator to incorporate modeling of deformation and relative permeability hysteresis to match injection/production pressures at Cadotte that are otherwise difficult to reproduce. The geomechanical model explains surface heave and high injectivity caused by dilation due to shear failure, increase in pore pressure/formation compressibility, and decrease in effective stress: A dilation pressure is specified, below which behavior is elastic (low compressibility) and above which, higher compressibility is used. Above a maximum porosity, further dilation is not permitted (low compressibility). The hysteresis model calculates grid-block relative permeabilities that lie on/between imbibition-drainage curves, making it possible to use laboratory-derived relative permeabilities and still match field WOR. 
Impacts of dilation-recompaction factors (fracturing pressure, maximum pressure, dilation pressure, recompaction pressure, and formation compressibility) are quantified through field results, history-match/sensitivity analysis, performance optimization, and uncertainty assessment, utilizing reservoir simulation, Latin hypercube designs and Monte Carlo simulation. 
Addressing geological/reservoir/operational variances, this modeling project helps determine optimum CSS development at Cadotte. It provides insight on how to screen the reservoir/operational parameters for successful CSS application in geologically-complex unconventional reservoirs with varying PVT behavior.|","Uncertainty Assessment, Dilation-Recompaction, Relative Permeability Hysteresis, Cyclic Steam Stimulation, Surface Heave"

Although convective heat flux is neglected in classic steam-assisted gravity-drainage (SAGD) models such as the one derived by Butler, heat convection through the condensate flow into porous media can be very important. A key control on the condensate flow is the in-situ relative-permeability to water within the reservoir. To date there is no methodology that can calculate the in-situ relative-permeability to water in SAGD reservoirs during steam injection and progression of the steam chamber. The in-situ relative-permeability to water during steam injection can be different from laboratory and well-test results. The problem with the results from lab test is that they are mostly from disturbed cores or remolded samples. And the issue with results from both lab and well testing is that at the edge of the steam chamber, bitumen undergoes thermal expansion of some 15%; therefore, unless the water saturation increases by a similar amount, water mobility is quickly decreased by the expanding bitumen phase. A method is provided to calculate in-situ relative-permeability in oil sand reservoirs using the distance between pressure and temperature response at the same depth. The implementation of the concepts is tested for Underground Test Facility (UTF) project. The results suggest that the in-situ relative-permeability to water during steam in most SAGD projects is limited to 10-4 to 10-5 and having higher relative permeabilities is only possible at lean zones.

This paper investigates the effect of anisotropic behavior of caprock shales on the caprock failure pressure in SAGD projects. Shales and mudstones exhibit strong anisotropy at the micro and macro scales. However, the anisotropic behavior has been neglected in the existing published works on this subject. 
In this research project, a coupled hydro-thermo-mechanical model was developed for the assessment of caprock integrity in thermal operations. A transversely isotropic constitutive model in the elastic range was combined with an anisotropic failure criterion to capture the intrinsic anisotropy of the cap shale. The coupled tool was validated against field data and employed in a study to determine the effect of shale anisotropic behavior on the pressure associated with caprock breach. 
Results display the effect of shale anisotropy on caprock response in terms of deformations, stresses and failure pressure. The assumption of isotropic shale behavior in caprock integrity assessment for a case study resulted in the overestimation of the failure pressure by about 10%. 
Existing numerical models for evaluating the integrity of caprocks during thermal operations employ isotropic constitutive laws. These models are believed to be deficient in capturing strongly anisotropic response of shales and mudstones. The research described in this paper incorporated elasto-plastic shale anisotropy in the caprock failure analysis model for the first time. The paper demonstrates the importance of capturing shale anisotropy in the accurate prediction of caprock breach pressure in SAGD projects.|","Shale intrinsic anisotropy, Caprock integrity, SAGD, Geomechanics, Coupled numerical modeling"

In thermal recovery from unconsolidated oilsands reservoirs and in association with fluid mobility, formation compressibility and modulus of elasticity are closely related to pressure transient and stress redistribution behavior, which can collectively affect the steam chamber development. The non-linearity and stress-dependency in bulk compressibility and modulus of elasticity of rocks has been captured through the development of elegant constitutive models (e.g. nonlinear elastic hyperbolic model) and has been readily integrated into coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulation packages. To assess the significance of these nonlinearities for reservoirs with different initial stress states, this paper presents an analytical study where the associated impacts on the redistribution of stress (stress-paths) and the onset of geomechanical mobilization (shear dilation) under the assumption of uniaxial deformation are quantified. Within the scope of this paper, (semi-) analytical modeling is conducted while special attention has been devoted to (1) the vast range of depths of the existing oilsands reservoirs and the associated implications on the initial stress distribution as well as stress redistribution due to steam/water injection, (2) the impacts on the onset of geomechanical mobilization within the practical ranges of injection pressures, and (3) the evaluation of geomechanical mobilization potential for thermal (steam injection) versus non-thermal (cold water injection) pressurization. The results show that (1) the potential impact of stress dependency on the variability of the geomechanical properties (modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio and formation compressibility) is more significant for shallow reservoirs as compared to mid-depth and deep reservoirs, (2) the injection pressure required to onset the geomechanical mobilization may be under/overestimated if the non-linearity in the mechanical properties is overlooked, and (3) the thermal geomechanical mobilization (steam injection) may have a higher potential within practical ranges of operating pressures as compared to non-thermal techniques (cold water injection), especially for shallower reservoirs. The inherent limitations of the analytical workflows as well as the requirements of supporting efforts through coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulations are also discussed.|","Reservoir Geomechanics, Non-linearity, Thermal Recovery, Oilsands, Compressibility"

Since 2012, horizontal wells at the Saleski pilot are operated with cyclic steam injection and production, recovering bitumen from the naturally fractured Grosmont carbonate reservoir. Steam has been injected in a continuous matter similar to SAGD, as well as in cyclic alteration with production from individual wells. Injection pressure is 50-60% of the overburden stress. 
The Grosmont reservoir is a highly fractured carbonate rock with excellent reservoir properties (i.e. high fracture permeability and porosity). The targeted producing horizons in this reservoir are Grosmont C (20 m pay) and D (30 m pay) unit, which are separated by a laterally extensive, 1-2 m thick Marl. 
The initial injectivity, which is superior to bitumen saturated sand reservoirs, can be explained by either high initial water mobility in the fractures or large system compressibility, or a combination of both. 
Since the Grosmont C unit is highly fractured, it can be characterized as a box filled with sugar cubes. The ‘stiff’ cubes can locally be displaced if the fractures are allowed to drain. Geo-mechanical simulations with deterministic fractures allow the calculation of the system compressibility and Young's Modulus, based on variations of fracture and matrix properties. Results indicate that the fracture properties dominate the system characterization. 
Using these insights, initial injectivity of a pilot well is matched with a reservoir model and a coupled geo-mechanical reservoir model to quantify the roles initial water mobility, matrix displacement and temperature play during cyclic operation of a naturally fractured reservoir.|","fractured carbonate, geomechanics, Grosmont"

The issues of caprock integrity have been thrust into the forefront of consideration and regulation. There have been several documented steam and bitumen leaks to surface and recently the AER has placed a moratorium on the licensing of shallow thermal in-situ oilsand projects. They have also sent out a series of draft requirements. In the interim, the draft letters are a good indicator of future requirements. 
A brief description will be made of the main technical issues in determining caprock integrity. A detailed discussion will also be made of the 5 separate documents issued by the AER. A practical approach to deal with these technical and regulatory requirements will be outlined. The foundation of all of this analysis is a good understanding of the conditions in the ground. The paper will concentrate on core acquisition, storage, analysis and preservation from the drill site to the laboratory. This is the starting point for laboratory testing, MOP determination, geomechanical modelling and thermal reservoir simulation.

Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) can significantly change the volume of the bitumen-bearing reservoir. Uneven uplift of overburden caused by such volume change induces noticeable stress perturbation in the structure providing containment for the steam/bitumen emulsion and may lead to material yielding in subsurface structure. To study the impact and mechanism of such a phenomenon, InSAR images of surface deformation were collected between 2010 and 2011 at a CSS operation site. These interferograms were processed to 14 snapshots of surface deformation within that period of time. We observed that heave and subsidence can occur simultaneously across one operation site, as the heated steam front moves through the reservoir. A brief review of the production history of the site indicates that the surface deformation is directly related to fluid injection and extraction. In the first step of our modelling, we invert the surface deformation to assess the extent of reservoir expansion/compaction and induced subsurface deformation. Due to the highly non-uniqueness nature of the inversion results, we carefully benchmarked the mathematical and geomechanical parameters used in the inversion process. The results from the selected inversion parameters are compared with forward modeling results to increase the confidence of the inversion scheme. Subsurface deformation is modelled sequentially through Finite Element forward modelling. The computed reservoir deformation is channeled into the commercial FEM simulation software Abaqus to assess the stress and strain of the overburden. We load the deformation computed from inversion at the reservoir/overburden interface and then simulate the corresponding stress and strain alteration of the overburden. Simulation results show that uneven uplift from reservoir expansion and compaction can alter the stress state of the overburden significantly. This study shows that with proper knowledge of in-situ geomechanical characteristics, InSAR coupled with geomechanical modelling can be a useful tool to understand injection/production monitoring data and identify possible effects of CSS operations on the structural integrity of subsurface.|","CSS, InSAR, Shearing, Geomechanics, Inversion"

The SAGD process can be achieved only after the thermal and hydraulic communication between the injection well and the production well has been established during the start-up operation. The start-up operation involves interactions of geomechanical responses and multiple phase flow behaviors in the inter-well formation. Such interaction would have an impact on SAGD in terms of recovery performance. This paper presents an experimental study on investigating the mechanisms and mechanics of geomechanical dilation and fundamentals during cold-water injection. 
A triaxial experimental program has been designed and conducted to verify geomechanical dilation through experimental measurements. A series of reconstituted water-wet/bitumen sand specimens were prepared with different fluid saturation and almost identical void ratio. Reclaimed/cleaned tailings sand from oil sands mining operations was used to prepare artificial specimens, which are representative of McMurray Formation oil sands. A water-wet or bitumen sand core plug was then tested in an environmental chamber to simulate reservoir boundary conditions in terms of stress state, temperature, and pore pressure. A series of experiments were carried out in a triaxial cell under either initial isotropic or initial anisotropic stress state. Experimental results highlight the promising potential to dramatically enhance effective permeability to water and porosity in the dilated zone with pore pressure injection at modest levels of stress anisotropy.

Optimizing the efficiency of the waterflood displacement process in heavy oils is critical to reaching the oil recovery goals. However, in the process of finding an economic and stable throughput for the process, in some cases significant sand production and generation of wormholes have resulted in premature water breakthrough and channelling destroying volumetric efficiency. In order to understand such events, a simulation study using a coupled reservoir and geomechanical simulator was used to determine the physics controlling the initiation and propagation of dilated zones resulting from sand production giving the premature breakthrough. An attempt was made to identify the importance of well configuration and what operating constraints can be altered to reduce the risk of these breakthrough events. 
The complex physics of sand production during oil recovery requires it to be modeled as a coupled process: multiphase fluid flow causing transient pressure gradients and geomechanics to calculate the resultant stress variation, permeability enhancement and shear/tensile failure around the induced dilated zone and finally coupling failure criterion for the dilated zone propagation combining pressure gradient and effective stress. A force balance criterion calculates the threshold fluid pressure gradient for sand mobilization based on the effective confining stresses in each numerical element. The stress variation across the loosely supported sand body (damage zone) at the edge of a dilated zone is captured by an elasto-plastic constitutive model using a Mohr-Coulomb shear failure surface combined with softening of the Young's modulus. 
The application of the coupled simulator in modeling waterflooding reveals critical insights regarding the significance of different factors contributing to the sand production problem. Multiphase flow, over vs. under-injection, and inter-well pressure gradient effects are critical to controlling the sand production initiation and evolution. Gas liberation below bubble point pressure conditions causes excessive pressure gradient and increases the possibility of sand production. The oil/water relative permeability impact emerges if the mixture mobility at a certain fraction is lower than the end points. As dilated zone geometry appears to follow the weakest zones often associated with high permeable layers; it highlights the significance of the reservoir heterogeneity in contributing to the sand production problem. The results of the current study add understanding to the significance of different mechanisms contributing to sand production and may be used to help mitigate the premature breakthrough problem observed in many waterflooding operations.|","Heavy oil, Sand production, Reservoir, Geomechanics, Waterflooding"

Cement is critical to well integrity. It provides hydraulic isolation, preventing fluid flow between producing zones, ground water aquifers, and the surface. In steam stimulated wells, such as for Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) or Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS), the heat-up period places severe mechanical loading on the cement sheath. Heat is transferred from high temperature steam, through completion strings and annular fluids, to the casing, cement and formation. Thermal expansion of the casing combined with axial constraint make radial expansion of the casing the most severe in the energy industry. Furthermore, with constrained expansion of the cement, the range of deformations that must be accommodated by the cement sheath while maintaining isolation is challenging. These deformations can cause shear or tensile failure of the cement and result in leakage paths through the cement (e.g. cracks or global changes in cement permeability), or leave a micro-annulus when recovery has been completed and thermal operations halt. 
This paper describes the impact of key thermal and mechanical properties on the structural performance of cement blends in thermally stimulated wells. The work is based on laboratory testing of thermal cement blends and the use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to examine cement performance under operating conditions. The findings provide insight into important cement behaviours that impact longterm integrity of cement and highlight the significance of conducting tests under field representative conditions. Results indicate the importance of compressive strengths, flexibility, and shrinkage/expansion characteristics to ensure the cement sheath remains structurally intact during initial heat-up.|","Cement, Thermal, Integrity, SAGD"

Production from these unconventional resources became economically feasible as a result of advances in both horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies. Stimulation technologies continue to improve through the combining of advanced logging, geomechanics, microseismic and frac fluids.  This has led to further optimization of hydraulic fracture treatments and higher recovered unconventional reserves.  |Petrophysical and geomechanical models are built using advanced well logging, special core analysis (SCAL), and rock mechanical properties.  Within the petrophysical evaluation, special care must be taken when transferring the dynamic values of Poisson’s ratio and Young modulus, obtained from acoustic data, to static values, to reduce the uncertainty of stress and fracture width estimations. Additionally, one of the key parameters in improving hydrocarbon production is choosing a suitable fluid type and associated chemicals to be used in reducing damage to the formation. Geomechanically, utilizing “Drilling-Induced Tensile Fractures” (DITFs) analysis is crucial to estimate fracture half-length, number of fracture stages, closure pressure of the frac and designing the appropriate pump rates. |This paper presents a case study from a Saudi Arabian shale formation. The described workflow is designed to help optimize both reservoir characterization and design of hydraulic stimulation treatments. It will be shown that engineered completions are more effective and yield higher ultimate recoveries than geometric spaced completions. Simulating a hybrid fracture design comparing both geometrically spaced clusters and petrophysically engineered clusters showed a 38 percent increase in conductivity within the engineered design. Particular attention has been given to the effects of natural fractures on the stimulation both in size and direction of extension.   |Introduction |Growing energy demand has forced the oil and gas industry to develop unconventional resources, including shale and tight sand reservoirs. Saudi Aramco has shown that reservoir potential for shale gas plays is promising. However, developing shale gas plays has many recognized challenges. High formation heterogeneity, clay laminations, types of clays will all play a major role in the petrophysical interpretation as well as Completion Quality (CQ or fracability) of the reservoirs. Any petrophysical interpretation should be processed using a deterministic method. This will yield a reservoir quality (RQ) quotient. Equally important is combing the geomechanical completion quality (CQ) with the petrophysical evaluation.  These will both be necessary when working with ultra-low permeability rocks that require engineered stimulations.  Combining the RQ and the CQ will allow us to better answer whether or not a stimulation treatment will be contained or propagate out of zone. After combing the RQ and CQ, advanced stimulation tools can then be used to incorporate that data and further improve the ultimate fracture design.|","Document Type

In the modeling process, in-situ stresses (orientation and magnitude) were obtained and integrated form the available information. Additionally, rock mechanical properties derived from P and S-wave velocities, were calibrated with the static properties derived from lab tests (triaxial test). Statistical analysis of the dynamic rock properties allowed constructing the failure envelopes for reservoir intervals with different strengths using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria, giving extra information of the stiffness variation and anisotropy within the same reservoir rock. Moreover, the model was further validated by the stress polygon and the expected faulting regime was constraint, giving an insight of main fractures orientation. A wellbore stability analysis was also done to check on breakouts tendency and best trajectory for new sidetracks and horizontal wells to be drilled.  |For this particular field, the effects of many years of depletion without pressure support and the subsequent effect of peripheral water injection are better understood under the geomechanical point of view. Changes in the effective stresses during pore pressure drawdown show a stress path that could easily activate natural fractures and might had created bigger fracture channels favoring flow of reservoir fluids to the wellbore after the power water injection was initiated. By the same talking, water injection seemed to enhance the far field stress stability, but it might create tensile fractures at the injector’s vicinity. In other words, knowledge of the in-situ stresses and its effects while depleting or increasing the pore pressure is of vital importance in reservoir management. Stability analysis suggests a formation stiff enough that can be drilled to any direction at any inclination angle; a condition that favors well spacing, but it should be handled with care in avoiding fracture corridors. |The results of this work suggest that good reservoir management may require the geomechanics component to optimize well performance and reservoir development. |Introduction |Setting a reservoir management strategy requires knowledge of technology, business environment and the best possible reservoir understanding.

The obtained results in this regard match the regional tendency and are aligned to the observed main fracture corridors. Historically, borehole problems during drilling operations have been properly addressed by the use of geomechanical models. For this particular case, a better understanding of the lack of borehole stability problems has been gain through the work done.

The key to successful fracturing treatment in shale formation is the identification of the sweet spots. Productive shale consists of quartz, feldspar or carbonate and clays, in addition to organic matter (Kerogen). Thus it is challenging process to map the best zones to fracture and locate horizontal wells. A new Fracturability Index based on mineralogy has been developed to locate the best areas along horizontal wells to fracture.

The application of this method to openhole well environments is challenged by the dominating impact of hoop stresses in the near-wellbore vicinity rather than far-field stress in the producing layer. As a result, even if the open hole is drilled in the direction of minimal horizontal far-field stress, there is a high probability that hydraulic fractures initiate longitudinally and then turn to the preferred fracture plane, creating undesired tortuosity. |One of the approaches towards controlling both the position and direction of fracture initiation is to cut notches in the wellbore wall at specified positions. As pressure increases during fracturing, those notches can locally eliminate the influence of the wellbore hoop stress and develop high tensile stress concentrations initiating transverse hydraulic fractures at lower pressures. |A theoretical model is proposed herein that aims to predict the position, orientation, and pressure at which a fracture initiates. In the model, the 3D stress state around wellbore and notch(es) is analyzed using the brittle fracture criteria. In the numerical implementation, the stresses are efficiently resolved using the boundary element method. The model is used to interpret published laboratory data on fracture initiation including those from hydraulic fracturing block tests. It is shown that the conventional maximum tensile stress (MTS) criterion fails to reproduce the observed trends in initiation pressure and fracture orientation. The nonlocal modification of the MTS criterion based on the stress averaging technique (SAMTS), reveals a good match with initiation pressures in simplified tests. When applied to hydraulic fracturing block test data, SAMTS captures the observed fracture orientations while overestimating the absolute pressure values. The discussion of possible reasons for that overestimate and the way forward concludes the paper. |Introduction In low-permeability formations, operators often perform multistage hydraulic fracturing stimulation treatments on intervals along horizontal wells to produce commercial volumes of hydrocarbons. This practice creates several hydraulic fractures oriented transversely to the wellbore, thus providing larger reservoir contact compared to a single longitudinal fracture. The number of fracturing stages run in a single well has been increasing over the last few years, which requires the refinement of the multistage fracturing techniques as well as completion methods from the point of cost, risk, and completion quality. In the case of tight and competent rock, the openhole completion of a horizontal well becomes a cost-effective alternative to a cemented completion. The widely used system to stimulate openhole intervals consists of the use of tubular and hydraulic or swellable packers to isolate fracturing stages (Aviles et al. 2013; Daneshy 2013). Sliding sleeve valves control the fracturing ports between packers and are activated subsequently over a single fracturing treatment from to toe to heel using a drop ball mechanism. Upon completion of stimulation of all stages, the balls are flowed back to the surface making the tubular a permanent completion. Compared to plug-and-perf techniques in cemented and cased wells, the drop ball technique in horizontal open holes becomes a cost- and time-effective alternative that is now run routinely around the world, in particular in Saudi Arabia (Al-Naimi et al. 2008; Rahim et al. 2011). However, these openhole systems also have potential drawbacks. Unlike cased wells that are stimulated through perforations, in openhole stimulation, the length of treated section is defined by the spacing between packers and can vary from 100 ft to 1,000 ft (Al-Naimi et al. 2008). This leads to fracture(s) initiating at location(s) along the wellbore subjected to the lowest in-situ stresses and/or surrounded by weaker rock or crossed by a natural fracture—factors that are out of the operator’s control. Also, even if the wellbore is drilled in the direction of the minimal horizontal far-field stress 
<U+03C3>h—the configuration that is favorable for the transverse fracture(s) creation— there is still a significant possibility that the fracture will initiate longitudinally. This basically comes from the fact that the pressurized cylindrical openhole wellbore develops tensile stresses in the circumferential direction rather than in the axial direction that is required for the initiation of transverse fracture (Daneshy 2009; Lecampion et al. 2013). The fracture initiated longitudinally may break beyond the packer and disturb the isolation between stages. Even though the fracture will finally reorient into the transverse direction according to the far-field stresses direction (Weijers et al. 1994; Daneshy 2013), it may create a tortuous fracture path in the vicinity of the wellbore, leading to higher fracturing treatment pressure, premature proppant settling, and near wellbore screen out, thus lowering the eventual completion quality.|","Document Type

The target reservoir is the “Shuaiba,” which is an extensively drilled carbonate reservoir. Also, the geomechanics and overall stresses of the Shuaiba were characterized back in 2001 in a study, which concluded that the maximum horizontal stress orientation in SHYB appeared to be north - south and that the magnitude of this stress is only slightly greater than, or equal to, the minimum horizontal stress making up what is known as a normal faulting stress state (Geomechanics International)2. Consequently, due to the limited amount of data that was available back in 2001, the conclusions regarding stress orientation would need to be confirmed as additional data becomes available. And nowadays, after 14 years of development, a larger set of data has become available. |Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to supplement the results of the previous geomechanical study performed in 2001 using recent drilling data from 100 wells drilled after the previous geomechanical study was conducted. In other words, this paper uses the findings of recent hole stability data from 100 wells to confirm the earlier suggested normal faulting stress state. And based on the findings of this analyses, there was no strong evidence to suggest that the hole becomes significantly more stable when drilling along the maximum horizontal stress direction (N-S) or conversely, becomes significantly less stable when drilling in any other direction, especially in the minimum horizontal stress direction (E-W). This finding confirms the normal faulting stress in SHYB and that hole stability does not vary greatly with drilling azimuth for this specific field. |Most of the last 100 wells drilled in SHYB were drilled along the NE - SW directions of the field. And from 84 wells drilled along the NE - SW directions, only six wells experienced hole instability. Also, out of 11 wells drilled in the N or S direction, which is the maximum horizontal stress direction, no hole stability issues were recorded. Out of the seven wells drilled in the E or W direction, which is the minimum horizontal stress direction, only one well experienced hole instability. Therefore, the findings of the analysis show that there is no strong evidence to indicate that significant hole stability improvement is achieved by drilling in the maximum horizontal stress direction. In conclusion, this paper discusses the results of a field wide case study performed using the drilling data of the last 100 wells drilled in SHYB. The available data seems to confirm the normal faulting stress state that was earlier suggested for the SHYB field. With this confirmation of stress orientation, the expectations for hole stability are improved and this reflects positively on well planning and overall field development.|",""

Low productivity indices are observed in many moderate-to low-permeability coal bed methane (CBM) and shale gas (SG) reservoirs due to low aperture and poor connectivity of natural cleats. 
A method is proposed for injection of graded proppant particles into a cleat system below the fracturing pressure to keep coal cleats and shale fractures open during water-gas production. Graded proppant injection in CBM and SG reservoirs can: stimulate a stress sensitive cleat system below the fracturing pressure; enhance fracturing treatment by invading cleats, lowering fluid leak-off, and maintaining aperture during production; and provide a periodic or remedial treatment to counter effective stress on the cleats improving production by maintaining cleat aperture. 
Laboratory tests on bituminous coal core flooding with water under increasing pore pressure with graded proppant injection at the maximum pore pressure (minimum effective stress) have been carried out at different ionic strengths and high pH of the injected water. Proppant particles penetrate deeper into coal matrix at low ionic strength of injected water corresponding to electrostatic particle-particle and particle-coal repulsion. No particle agglomeration and formation of particle-formed cake at the entrance of coal cleats are observed at these conditions. Coal permeability increases by about 2.2 times as the result of a single-sized small particle injection. Followed injection of larger particles leads to a greater enhancement of coal core permeability. An overall increase of coal core permeability after graded proppant injection is about 2.7 times. 
The proposed method can significantly increase very low productivity index in stress sensitive coals and shales without hydraulic fracturing. It can be also used as a non-damaging leak-off additive during hydraulic fracturing stimulation treatments and to aid long-term conductivity.|","coal seam gas, graded proppant injection, productivity enhancement, natural fracture stimulation"

Candidate recognition in mature brown fields and depleted fields for stimulation has always been a challenging task. It has become a common practice for many operators that when all else fails they turn to stimulating the well. The application of fracturing for any poor producer in a brown field does not guarantee success. Since traditional reservoir engineering methods like skin analysis via build-ups cannot be applied in these depleted reservoirs alternative techniques have to be used. 
Identifying and stimulating key wells requires a systematic candidate recognition process with emphasis on the ability of the well to deliver post stimulation. Having a method to score completion and production integrity based on its petrophysical and geomechanical characteristics and thoroughly understanding the operating environment ensures a much better chance for these wells to be successful. Comprehensive candidate selection methodology with available data was devised to identify best stimulation candidates from existing set of wells. Comparative Petro-physical log evaluation, Mechanical Earth modelling and oriented perforations in selected wells was deployed to further understand reservoir and rock mechanical properties and limit surface pressures by minimizing near wellbore perforation and tortuosity effects. 
Further to estimate economic viability; analytical modelling and Arps production decline was combined utilizing local learnings and experience to predict post fracture production. Full set of diagnostic tests was done to make a robust model that can simulate fracture propagation and help in optimizing fracturing design to place desired fracture in place. Post fracturing cleanup and well activation was closely monitored with design and recommendation on required Artificial Lift techniques as and when required. Production results achieved after applying this workflow exceeded initial expectations set by operator. Payout period achieved for total investment in this project was 75-150 days. Due to these encouraging results, same workflow was applied in number of depleted fields in Cambay basin with similar results. 
This paper will summarize the workflow used for revitalizing production from some of the major fields including Candidate selection methodology, Petro-physical evaluation, Mechanical earth modelling, diagnostic tests for fracturing design, production forecasting, post fracture well activation and artificial lift design. In the end, possibilities of deploying this workflow for re-vitalizing other brownfields will be discussed.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Stimulation, Candidate Selection, Workflow, Mechanical Earth Modelling"

D., Kuwait Oil Company","|Abstract  Objectives/Scope 
Unconventional organic-rich carbonaceous shale (OCS) in North Kuwait has unique characteristics due to its high total organic content (12–14%), its complex mineralogy (blend of carbonates and clastics) and Jurassic/post-Jurassic complex burial and tectonic history. The OCS is under/over-laid by tight carbonates, where the system permeability is in the range of nano to micro-Darcy. Conventional techniques to initiate flow from this complex reservoir have proven ineffective, which led the appraisal team to develop novel and extensive workflows to characterize the formation properties for successful hydraulic fracturing and to determine the commercial flow potential of hydrocarbons.   Methods, Procedures, Process 
Three vertical wells were identified as the high potential candidates in the appraisal program, prior to the completion of horizontals in this complex formation. A comprehensive logging suite was acquired which included spectroscopy, sonic and image logs. Fracture pressure analysis was performed on an offset well followed by exhaustive diagnostic tests using both non-viscous and viscous fluids. Bottom hole gauges were hanged in the well during the diagnostic tests as well as temperature logging was performed after the diagnostic pumping to define fracture height growth/containment. Proppant fracturing in these wells are planned using nonradioactive tracer proppant.   Results, Observations, Conclusions 
Maximum clay content in the OCS is estimated close to 40% in addition to the high organic content. Anisotropic mechanical earth model was built using sonic log response for fracture modelling in planar 3-D simulators. Some open fractures were observed from the image logs. Fracture pressure analysis on the offset well confirmed ""fraccability"" of the OCS within the allowable pressure limits. Analysis of the diagnostic tests confirmed significant impact of natural fracture on hydraulic fracture propagation. Nolte-Smith plot using actual bottom-hole pressure revealed very high net pressure slope during viscous fluid stages that raised significant concerns on possibility of placing proppant. Interventions after the diagnostic tests showed flowback of formation material in the form of ""formation creep"" into the wellbore and that lead to concerns on formation integrity and risks in proppant placement.   Novel/Additive Information 
This paper discusses various methods used to understand the complex OCS formation and integrates extensive analysis achieved through different methods. Interpretation of this data-set and building a model which will be used for development of future horizontal wells will also be presented. It is believed that the inherent challenges presented by the OCS are unique without any true global analogues in the unconventional gas and oil programs.|","diagnostic tests, Unconventional, Carbonaceous, Candidate Recognition, Hydraulic fracturing"

The aim of hydraulic fracturing is the generation and maintenance of highly permeable pathways. To achieve this, a high hydraulic pressure is applied to overcome the breakdown pressure in developed formations. To avoid the closure of the generated fractures due to the acting in-situ stress in the subsurface, proppantsareused. The hydraulic conductivity (Cf) of such a fracture is defined as the permeability of the proppant pack (kpr) times the fracture width (wf). However, this value cannot be considered a constant. The increasing effective pressure leads to an increased stress on the proppants, thus increasing their embedment into the formation surface. Such a situation becomes particularly critical in weak formations and in formations where the interaction between the frac fluid and the formation can lead to a change in the mechanical properties in the fracture face. This paper will present an approach to model the embedment of various kinds of proppant packs with respect to the proppant size distribution and the proppant density. This approach uses the indentation hardness of the surface formation to calculate the embedment. The advantage of this parameter, which can be measured by applying the hardness test according to Brinell, is that it describes the mechanical properties of the surface of the formation. This area, which is highly influenced by the treatment fluid, can show great differences in the mechanical behavior compared to the untreated area. This can lead to an under- or overestimation of the embedment, since the mechanical parameters normally used for calculation are measured on core samples representing the mechanical behaviour of the untreated rock mass. The consideration of the indentation hardness can lead to a more accurate embedment prediction, since it describes the behaviour of the first 0.1-2 mm of a surface, in which the embedment alone can lead to a closure of a fracture. The first series of hardness tests according to Brinell, conducted on different shale types, have proven that the fluid composition affects the indentation hardness of the samples, which will of course affect the depth of the embedment. The measurements are the basis for the embedment modelling which will be presented in this article.|","Shale formations, Hydraulic fracturing, proppant embedment"

Hydraulic fracturing in tight gas sandstone reservoirs increases the connectivity of the well to more reservoir layers and farther areal regions, thus boosting the production as well as the net-present-value of the project. When comparing different well performances, wells that far outperform other wells are usually connected to high permeability streaks or natural fractures. This paper demonstrates the analysis and performance evaluation of hydraulic fractures that are connected to high permeability streaks or natural fractures. 
In order for oil and gas operators to consider the development of tight gas sandstone reservoirs economically feasible, stimulation operations such as a large hydraulic fracture treatment of the wells are required. However, the induced fracture is not the main reason for the success of many of the field development in tight gas sandstone reservoirs. In the Southern North Sea, the more productive multiple hydraulically fractured horizontal wells (MHFHW) are usually connected to high permeability streaks or natural fractures. In this work, a reservoir with high permeability streaks and natural fractures was then modelled. This is then calibrated against several years of production and pressure history. 
The analysis of core data, borehole image logs, well tests and geomechanics data demonstrated the existence of high permeability streaks or natural fractures in the reservoir. The data derived from the analytical methods were then captured in the simulation model. The simulation model shows a very good match with the history data and when compared with a 3-week long shut-in, the build-up pressure response and its derivative displayed an excellent match. This study shows that, in addition to the role played by the hydraulically induced fractures, natural fractures and high permeability streaks also serve as dominant factors in success of tight gas sandstone reservoir development. 
This study demonstrates a practical integrated approach towards the modelling of high permeability streaks and natural fractures that are connected to hydraulic fractures. This can be used to better understand hydraulic fracturing and tight gas sandstone reservoirs in the Southern North Sea.|","Natural Fracture High Perm streaks, Reservoir Simulation, Hydraulic Fracturing, Reservoir Modelling, Southern North Sea"

The fluid leak-off into the shale matrix during hydraulic fracture treatment has been a critical issue in determining fracture geometry. Furthermore, fluid intake also affects mechanical properties of the surrounding rock matrix which in turn affects fracture propagation. Conventional approaches for the prediction of leak-off have been inadequate as several important phenomena are ignored. In this paper the osmotic and capillary effects on fluid leak-off during shale gas reservoir stimulation are considered. A simplified structure is used to depict the complex pore network in shales. Different interactive forces involved in fluid displacement are taken into account in the mathematical formulation of the model. The proposed numerial model is used to study the amount of fluidfluid leak-off and the consequent pressure increase due to gas entrapment as well as potential influence of increase in pore pressure on the generation of micro-fractures are discussed. 
The simulation results show excellent agreement with the previous experimental observations, and indicate that the water leak-off greatly depends on composition of shale matrix and concentration of different components of the fracture fluid. Clay minerals for example, are naturally prone to water invasion and draw water faster than other hydrophilic minerals and organic matter because of their osmotic effect. Furthermore, the invaded water significantly increases the pore pressure within the shale matrix due to gas entrapment. This leads to a strong non-linear relationship between fluid leak-off and the square root of time. An increase of pore pressure also results in a decrease in effective stress which leads to the generation of tension and shear micro-fractures in shale matrix. These Physical alterations increase the complexity of hydraulic fractures. 
This study emphasizes the significance of osmotic and capillary effects as well as gas entrapment on hydraulic fracturing treatment of shale gas reservoirs. Moreover, the new leak-off model can be applied to investigate fracture propagation behaviour in shale gas reservoir.|","osmosis, shale gas, capillary pressure, gas entrapment"

Continuous closedloop monitoring of the well and automated early kick detection and control helps to keep the influx volume at a minimum before it reaches the well-control-threshold margin in the kick-tolerance matrix. |This paper presents a case study and detailed analysis of the event through advanced simulations to examine the benefits of automated influx detection and control by use of a managed-pressure-drilling (MPD) system compared with a conventional-wellcontrol method. In the case study, an automated-MPD system successfully detected and controlled a gas influx in oil-based mud while drilling in onshore western Canada. The analysis used dynamic well-control simulations to regenerate the event, and a close match with the field data was achieved. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to study the effect of total response time on pressures at the surface and at the casing shoe during the application of the conventional “driller’s method” of well control.  |The findings from the study demonstrate how automated early kick detection and control minimize influx volume and increase operational safety.

In the frame of energy/heat/resources production and geogas storage by new technologies among the European Energy Platforms and Set Plan Energy, the paper considers some peculiar case histories – Italian mainly – during a decade of a fruitful cooperation between industry and Academia/Research Centers, in the frame of the growing need of “Debate Publique”, within a complex and motley stakeholders community made by scientific-industry-public institutions. They are involved in the difficult task to study and accept (or refuse) projects strongly impacting the lived territory & underground, in densely populate countries, in terms of appropriate public communication and sound deontological behaviour (Geo-Ethics, as discussed in the recent Trieste Next EnergEthic public conference, September 26-28, 2014 and during the Energy Italian Summit in Milan, September, 29- October, 1, 2014, where the authors were involved in round tables as front end with the population too).
The paper recalls and rework years of “scientific” communication within the mass-media in this field, in the past also highlighting the positive and negative messages within articles (Quattrocchi, 2008). The newspaper articles need to be read in comparison to the true and objective scientific experimental data, gathered by the real scientific work, as perceived by citizens of medium scholastic culture, which not delve the geologic disciplines, but receive simply the journalistic front-end, very often as sensationalist scoops.This path progressively tangles as a consequence of the complex and conflicting use of underground to produce energy (hydrocarbons, geothermal reservoirs, gas storages, unconventional gas/oil, etc..), or resources (i.e., REE mining, etc…)
The efforts to review a “paper” published on newspapers and blogs could be more difficult than to review a scientific paper, as a consequence of the peculiar situations behind the scenes and the conflicts of interests staying in the nest, in a newspaper article or in a blog comment (locally political interests, commercial interests, attention-seeking, colleagues envies, etc..):herewith we discuss the case history of Commissione ICHESE.
The scientific journalists are normally of low scientific and ethical level and they are often coopted by negative mechanisms (mainly political for some newspapers or TV): the synergies among industry and Academia could lower a lot these negative situations.
In conclusions we suggest a “scientific journalist licence” and – paradoxically - grave procedures of “Hyppocrates adjuratory” for scientific journalists as well as for scientific community and operators involved in the sector. The case histories reported are emblematic of how the road is long, meandrous, but necessary.
A new text for a smart and innovative European Directivity to use underground to produce energy and Heat – including conventional & unconventional hydrocarbons - is discussed, as a result of a strict interaction between industry and Academia/Research, starting from the complex Italian Regulatory Issue: also a new communication-dissemination regulatory framework shoud be added.|","Document Type

The KS reservoir is a naturally fractured, deep, tight gas sandstone reservoir under high tectonic stress. Development wells for this reservoir are of depths in excess of 6,500 m TVD. Stimulation is required to provide production rates that sufficiently compensate for the high cost of drilling and completing wells to access this deep reservoir. Hydraulic fracture design and execution must be optimal to ensure economic production. To effectively stimulate a more than 200-m thick sandstone reservoir yielding consistently high performance, it is critical to understand the interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures, as the natural fractures significantly affect the growth and geometry of hydraulic fractures. 
To this end, a comprehensive study was conducted involving frac pressure analysis of previously stimulated wells, microseismic data analysis, hydraulic fracturing modeling by using a fracturing simulator that honors the natural fracture system, near-wellbore 4D geomechanical simulation of mechanical response of natural fractures during hydraulic fracturing, and large block hydraulic fracturing tests. This study reveals that existing natural fractures results in complexity of hydraulic fracture systems both in the near wellbore region and in the far field region. The complexity in the far field is largely controlled by the intersection angle (defined as the angle between the natural fracture strike and the maximum horizontal stress direction) given the large differential horizontal stress in this field. 
Based on an understanding of the interaction mechanism, an optimization of the hydraulic fracturing strategy was implemented in KS field. Improvements were made in staging, perforation, diversion, and the pumping schedule, which increased the averaged production rate more than 50% compared with previously stimulated wells.|","Naturally Factured Reservoir, Tight Gas, Hydraulic Fracturing"

Shale resource development technology is being improved and optimized over the last decade as the industry has seen a sharp rise in production and IP rates in North America and most recently from Europe and Australia while initial activities are on the rise in Latin America, Middle East and China. Despite such improvements, if one takes a closer look at the performance of the wells, one will find that not all wells are producing commercially and for that matter even wells that are producing commercially not all hydraulic fracture stages are contributing. This scenario is further compounded with the fact that unconventional resource development has a narrow profit margin for the E&P operators and in turn for the service industry. The industry needs to focus on the balance between efficient deployment of fit-for-purpose technology with strict economics in mind. As this transformation is undergoing, we are also seeing the trend of the technology application becoming more conventional and shredding the Unconventional shroud.
This conundrum potentially suggests that when dealing with shale resource one is faced with sweet spot identification in a basin / field and at the same time moving away from geometric (say every 250 ft.) selection of hydraulic fracture stages and placing stages where appropriate from a productivity point of view.
This paper documents certain well defined criterion used to identify the sweet spot location within a field / basin for the optimal well placement. We further document the vital formation / zone characteristic related information that can define the placement for hydraulic fracture stages and thus move away from the arbitrary geometric placement. Such an optimized plan can allow placement of productive wells and frac stages and thereby enhancing productivity and reducing well drilling and stimulation expenses. The key is effective cost reduction.
The paper illustrates the well placement optimization process through a combination of seismic attribute analysis combined with petrophysical and geochemical analysis via core and geophysical log measurements. The hydraulic fracture stage placement relies on the need to understand existing natural fracture system through geophysical log measurements and the interaction between the created hydraulic bi-wing tensile fracture and the surrounding shear fractures.
The paper concludes by presenting examples from three basins demonstrating the practical application of the methodology while illustrating the transformation of the Unconventional techniques as potentially Conventional.|","Document Type

Production from unconventional gas resources (UGRs) has received great attentions because of their large reserves as well as technical advances in developing these reservoirs. The fluid flow in ultralow permeability porous media cannot be considered in the range of conventional Darcy flow as it undergoes a transition from a Darcy regime to slip flow and free molecule flow regimes. Understanding fluid flow inside the matrix and how the matrix permeability evolves over depletion are among the major challenges to unconventional gas reservoirs characterization. Considering different flow regimes in UGRs and time dependent permeability during the production of reservoir, the applicability of the availabe numerical simulatior to predict the production from unconventional reservoirs is questionable. 
In this paper, a numerical approach is proposed for simulation of gas production of UGRs including geomechanical effect, slippage effect and non-Darcy flow. In this simulation, gas production is calculated using a pseudo-pressure integral for well inflow performance and material-balance for reservoir depletion. The numerical approach has been verified by comparing with the results of fine-grid compositional simulation for a typical conventional gas reservoir. The pseudo pressure-integral has been extended to include the geomechanical effect and time dependent matrix permeability. The flow regime is distinguished by Knudsen number for each regions of the reservoir during the reservoir depletion. 
According to the numerical results, the matrix permeability changes depending on the flow regime determined by Knudsen dimensionless number. Slip flow and Knudsen diffusion which are dependent on net pore pressure can play important roles in the gas production. Higher-than–expected matrix permeability becomes more highlighted when the permeability of the matrix decreases and dimensionless Knudsen number is higher than 0.1. This higher permeability enhances the gas production. On the other side, the matrix permeability decrease as the net overburden stress increases during the production life of the reservoirs. This decrease in matrix permeability clearly decreases the rate of gas production. 
The presented numerical simulation evaluates the significance of different flow regimes, time dependent permeability and geomechnical effect in production from UGRs. It also offers a rapid and simple tool for prediction of gas deliverability of UGRs well.|","Unconventional Reservoirs, Flow Regime, Slip Flow, Tight Gas, Shale Gas"

The occurrence of a sequence of damaging earthquakes in May 2012 near the Cavone oil field, in Northern Italy, raised the question of whether these earthquakes might have been triggered by oil and gas activities, such as fluid extraction and injection. Here, we analyze geologic and seismic reflection data along with previous studies to determine rates, patterns and modes of deformation recorded in the folds and faults that comprise the Cavone structure, and examine the rate of ongoing deformation observed by GPS, as well as the historical rate at which earthquakes comparable to the 2012 sequence have occurred.
To estimate the change in reservoir pore pressure and stress on the regional faults due to oil production and water injection, we investigated the properties of the reservoir by means of well tests. Interference tests carried out in 2014 at the Cavone 14 injection well allowed us to constrain the range of values of reservoir permeability, and also suggested the presence of fractures intersecting the well that result in high transmissivity within a region of many tens of meters around the well. The interference tests also indicate the presence of geologic structures that impede flow at larger distances.
Here, we study, by way of numerical modeling and simulation, the potential for induced seismicity at the Cavone oil field. Using a coupled flow and geomechanics model of the field that honors reservoir geology and historical well schedule, we simulate oil production and water injection in the field for a period of three decades leading up to the earthquake sequence. We calculate the change in Coulomb stress on the bounding Mirandola fault, which sourced the May 29, 2012 M 5.8 earthquake. This quantity varies in space and evolves in time with changing pore pressure and total stress in the reservoir. A novel and important aspect of our work is the identification of a potential instability mechanism for a bounding fault at the edge of a reservoir experiencing pressure depletion. The discontinuity in pore pressure across the fault means that there is a discontinuity in effective normal stress and that, therefore, the Coulomb failure criterion must be evaluated locally on both sides of the fault. We track the evolution of the Coulomb stress at the hypocenter of the earthquake and compare it with the tectonic stressing rate in the region to conclude in favor of tectonic origin of the earthquake. In addition, analysis of the locations of aftershocks of the May 2012 sequence shows a lack of seismicity in the area where the stressing rates from contraction of the reservoir are largest. This observed lack of seismic activity within 1–2 km from the reservoir suggests that fluid production and injection from the Cavone field was not an important driver for the observed seismicity.|","Document Type

Channel sandstones have a particularly important place among sandstone reservoirs. Their exploitation is especially challenging because of the impact of reservoir heterogeneities, channel connectivity and well position. Understanding which channels are drained or swept during water flooding would greatly improve the possibility to increase oil recovery. Although ground movements induced by pressure sinks generated in the reservoir by production are generally very limited, surface deformation is known to reflect the pressure distribution in the reservoir. Thus, deformation monitoring of onshore reservoirs can provide useful information about which portions of the reservoir are actually being produced or where pressure is supported by water encroachment, or by water injection in the case of oil reservoirs. Standard ground surface monitoring techniques (such as: levelling campaigns, tiltmeters or GPS) are usually time-consuming in providing accurate measures for a limited set of benchmarks. However, the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has proven to be a cost-effective tool to measure surface displacement with millimetric precision over wide areas. The possibility to measure surface effects due to reservoir exploitation depends chiefly on the depth and extension of the reservoir, magnitude of pressure depletion within the reservoir, formation heterogeneity and geomechanical properties. This paper presents the results of a study aimed at assessing the effects of these parameters on the surface deformation pattern and magnitude for fluvial reservoirs. Since meandering and braided rivers often generate poorly connected reservoir sand bodies of different size and sinuosity, the approach taken was to build a number of geological models representing fluvial depositional environments at different depths. Then production and water flooding in alternating channels was simulated. Eventually, three-dimensional geomechanical models were developed for each reservoir so as to calculate the vertical and horizontal (longitudinal and transversal) components of the displacements. In order to assess whether these displacements could be detected via InSAR, the three different components of displacement were combined to calculate the Line Of Sight (LOS), to simulate the corresponding satellite displacement measurement; the latter was then compared with the sensitivity of the InSAR technique. Results show that, depending on reservoir depth, extension and pressure decline, a correspondence between the distribution of sand bodies within the reservoir and the surface displacement pattern can be established. Conversely, for the typology of reservoir under analysis, geomechanical properties turn out to play a minor role in the clear detection of surface deformations.|","Document Type

The high prices of energy encourage investments in oil and gas research and development leading to new or improved technologies to recover more hydrocarbons from resources and re-evaluate the reserves. As a result of such technological developments and experience of job practices, hydraulic fracturing techniques have improved significantly in terms of designing and execution and this, at the same time, has made the process much more complicated. This paper suggests a practical multi-disciplinary workflow for hydraulic fracturing modelling mainly in tight gas sandstone reservoirs. 
Hydraulic fracturing stimulations in costly environments such as the Southern North Sea require deeper insight into the chemistry and mechanics of the process, characteristics of the formation, and most importantly, the interactions during and after the stimulation job. Different sources of information and analysis such as seismic, reservoir static modelling, initial geomechanical modelling, initial hydraulic fracturing study, fracture initiation point analysis, 1-dimensional (vertical) stress modelling per frac, mini-frac, mainfrac, flowback analysis, well test analysis, and reservoir dynamic modelling are discussed in this paper. The key data cross checks are recognised and lessons learnt from industry are also incorporated to highlight the possible outcomes of different decisions. 
Having more information, particularly from different disciplines, can be more productive only if a comprehensive guideline explains the essential elements of the required studies and illustrates their interrelations. This workflow has been the reference of a validated study for a multi-fracced tight gas sandstone reservoir in the Southern North Sea. The workflow has been deployed to organise and recognise the key elements that control the performance of hydraulically fractured wells in a heterogeneous environment. From the workflow, a thorough examination and analysis of available data were performed and fed into the static and dynamic models. As a result of the integrated workflow, a better understanding of the reservoir was formed and potential upside opportunities became visible.

Field X is located off-shore beneath ~100m of water. Initially, long horizontal production wells and sub-vertical water injection wells were used for the field development. When one of the oil production wells located at the edge of the field watered out, it was decided to convert it for water injection. Since reservoir permeability is low (tens of mD), generation of injection induced hydraulic fractures is expected. 
The following questions needed to be addressed in order to mitigate risks and guarantee operational success of the water injection program: |How will injectivity of the long horizontal injector develop over time? 
How long would injection induced fractures grow over time? 
In which direction are the fractures going to grow with respect to the horizontal wellbore (i.e., could they reach an adjacent producer)? 
What will be the outflow fraction of the injected water from the horizontal wellbore versus the induced fracture?|To answer these questions, a simplified horizontal well flow model was coupled with a fracture model. This fracture model required geomechanical input in form of present day in-situ stresses (both orientation as well as magnitudes) and pore pressures as well as rock mechanical properties in form of Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio. Resulting from the geomechanical analysis, we found that the present day stress state is that of a normal to strike slip faulting environment (i.e., Sv ~ SHmax > Shmin) whereby well head pressures in excess of 80 bar with Shmin gradient of 0.6 psi/ft would induce fracturing in the reservoir with a well confined direction. 
The geomechanical-fluid flow model calculated the various pressure drops from the wellbore sand face into the reservoir, location of the different fronts (thermal, water), and propagation of the induced fracture along with plugging of the inside fracture faces. 
A good history match of the ongoing water injection into the horizontal well was achieved. The forward simulations showed that fractures are being generated dependent on the injection rates, water quality, injection temperature and the minimum principal horizontal stress (Shmin). When injection rates are too high, a substantial amount of water – in excess of 50% – is expected to be injected into the induced fracture despite very good water quality and the horizontals appreciable length (i.e., more than 2000 m). 
The geomechanical model suggests that induced fractures are more likely to initiate in a region of lower stress along the wellbore caused by localized facies variation and propagate from there initially in a direction closely parallel to the wellbore (i.e., (sub-) longitudinal with the wellbore axis by ±20°). 
To optimize field management and to avoid the generation of extensive induced transverse fractures, water injection is recommended at a maximum injection rate of 7,500 bbl/d, a minimum injection temperature above 55°C, and a water quality of less than 3ppmv (6 micron particle diameter). The optimization is confirmed with the observation that the closest producer shows signs of pressure support with an increase in oil production, but no evidence of premature water breakthrough.|","Off - shore, Low Permeability, Water Injection, Induced Fractures, Horizontal Well"

In line with other investigators, technical integrity is assumed if there is no significant leak in the subsurface system from the storage reservoir. The evaluation of integrity of abandoned wells over a long time frame during CO2 underground storage can only be performed indirectly and requires a comprehensive understanding of relevant thermal/hydraulic/mechanical/chemical processes affecting well integrity. This paper presents an integrated approach coupling qualitative features, events, and processes (FEPs) and scenario analysis with quantitative-model development and consequence analysis. The qualitative analysis provides a solid and comprehensive study on all the FEPs that affect well integrity. The mechanical model presents the stress distribution of the casing/cement/rock composite system and provides a quantification of the defect dimension caused by different load conditions. The defect dimension can be used to compute equivalent permeability of the cement sheath by use of empirical correlations, which is an important input parameter for the following CO2-leakage simulation, provided it is considered that CO2 can only migrate through the defects instead of the cement matrix. When integrity is compromised, the storage reservoir will leak CO2. For this leakage, a numerical model is presented to simulate the flow of CO2 along abandoned wellbores during the storage period, such as 1,000 years. It is found from the FEP analysis that the most-critical system components are caprock, casing/cement/rock composite system, and abandonment elements. By building a geomechanical model and a leakage model, it is also found that in the simulated scenarios the CO2-leakage rate is very small except for when using cement sheaths of very poor quality, which can lead to a leakage rate exceeding the maximum-allowable value. The sensitivity analysis shows that the vertical permeability of the cement sheath plays the most critical role. In comparison with previous studies, this method is comprehensive and easy to implement.|","CO2 leakage,  downhole condition changes,  well integrity,  CO2 underground storage,  micro-annulus"

Project ""Hectarea Fracturada"" by the Operating National Mexican Company was the first simultaneous stimulation of two parallel horizontal wells (i.e., zipper hydraulic fracturing) project in Latin America, implementing a reservoir-specific approach by integrating geological, geophysical, petrophysical, and geomechanical assessments. The project was executed in fields located in a basin in the north region of Mexico, which consists of alternating shales and thin bedded sandstones. The target sandstone formation at the location of two horizontal wells is deemed tighter (i.e., > 1 md) than the other area in the basin. 
Initial production from the two horizontal wells after a total of 32 hydraulic fracture stages was 8, 320 BOPD. The initial production was greater than 15 times the average initial production from conventional single-frac wells in the area and was approximately 40 times greater than the initial production from the vertical offset well. The production from the two horizontal wells stabilized at 2, 517 and 1, 011 BOPD, respectively. A typical conventional well in this area produced 220 BOPD, while the offset well yielded 100 BOPD. The two horizontal wells had 240, 000 bbl of 90-days cumulative production, which exceeded 14 times the average cumulative production from the conventional wells in the fields. Application of the completion technology was considered successful and was extended to other not conventional and mature fields, with similar successes.|","Geomechanics, tight, shale, zipper, hydraulic fracture"

The paper has not been peer reviewed. |Microbial-influenced corrosion (MIC) has been implicated in few corrosion-related challenges in the well-service industry in the past. Recently, however, the industry is observing an increase of MIC-related equipment damage. This upsurge of MIC coincides with a switch to unconventional water sources, including recycled water. This paper is an overview of premature coiled-tubing and other-well-servicing-equipment failures and pumping-equipment damage related to MIC. |Introduction |Recycled fracturing water has been found to contain high levels of bacteria, typically on the order of 106–109 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL. The bacteria can originate from essentially anywhere in the water-handling system: the water source, transportation, storage, pumps, or downhole. Tanks and pits used for storage of flowback water are ideal habitats for bacteria; typically, these are sessile environments; the water temperature is commonly 15–35°C; and organic compounds found in the water such as oil carryover, surfactants, or polymers can be ideal carbon and energy sources for many microbial species. Higher-than-normal bacteria populations and clear evidence of MIC have been identified from flowback water in the Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Haynesville, and Horne River shale plays. |MIC |Microbes do not have a significant impact on general metal corrosion. MIC, on the other hand, is localized. This is because microbes tend to locate themselves in out-of-the-way locations such as cracks and pits or under scale or other deposits, presumably because these places are less affected by the flow of passing fluids. Once one or more species have attached themselves to a surface, many more species follow suit. It is through this process that a biofilm is built. MIC occurs where the biofilm and the metal come into contact. Probably the most notorious and widely studied of the microbes implicit in MIC are sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and acid-producing bacteria, although iron-oxidizing bacteria, sulfate-reducing archaea, thiosulfate- reducing bacteria, nitrate-reducing bacteria, and methanogenic archaea are also known to be involved.|","Document Type

Ltd.| Kim, Hee Taek, Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd.","|The purpose of this research is to find practical methods to predict the course stability of towed offshore structures at the initial design stage. The equilibrium yaw angles of a towed Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) with a single skeg and twin skegs are predicted by a drift model test and a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The results are compared with the towing model test results. Additionally, CFD towing simulations are performed and validated, and the mechanism of instability is analyzed through an investigation of physical quantities obtained from the CFD simulations. |Introduction |The demand for offshore structures such as Floating Production Storage and Offloadings (FPSOs) and semi-submersibles has increased in order to develop offshore oil and gas fields. Offshore structures constructed at shipyards should be transported safely to the oil fields. They are generally towed by several tugboats and towing lines. Defined as whether the towed offshore structure follows the desired course of the tugboats, the course stability is one of the indices for safe transportation. If the course stability is not secured enough, it will be difficult to keep the course, and eventually the overall transportation may fail in the worst case. If the transportation fails, the risk of collision with other vessels or geographic features increases, which may lead to damage to the towed offshore structure or even a catastrophic oil spill. |Governed by the submerged hull form, the hydrodynamic characteristics can change the course stability. In other words, transportation safety starts from the design stage of the hull form. Therefore, the prediction of the course stability is one of the most important aspects of the design and engineering of offshore projects. Much research has been done on the prediction of the course stability. Strandhagen et al. (1950) investigated the course stability criteria for the towed vessels using the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. Bernitsas and Kekridis (1985) suggested the discriminant using characteristic equations derived from the equations of motion of the towed vessel. |As of now, the prediction of the course stability of towed vessels at the design stage heavily depends on the model tests in marine industries. Latorre (1988) investigated the scale effect on the course stability of towed barges. He found that the model resistance was larger than the full-scale resistance. On the basis of his findings, he indicated that the model barge might overesti mate the course stability compared to the full-scale barge due to the scale effect. You (2000) carried out the towing model tests for a tanker ship and an FPSO. He found that the FPSO achieved better course stability than the tanker. Jung et al. (2005) performed the towing model tests to investigate the bow shape effect on the course stability of FPSOs. Two different types of bow shapes were tested: a barge bow shape and a spoon bow shape. It was found that the barge bow shape obtained better course stability than the spoon bow shape. Yang and Hong (2006) carried out extensive towing model tests for different stern hull shapes, skegs, and bilge radii for an FPSO. Kwon (2007) performed the towing model tests for the forward blocks of container ships and tankers. The towing model tests showed that the container blocks were towed with a fishtailing motion. Yang et al. (2011) investigated the interactions between a tugboat, tow lines, and a towed vessel through two different modelings of tugboats, in which the FPSO model was directly towed by a carriage and towed by a free-sailing tug model. |As previously mentioned, the model test is widely used for its reliability, but there are many limitations such as time, cost, measurements, and test facilities. It is also extremely difficult to redesign the hull form after the model test by reason of the poor course stability since the basic design is nearly finished at the model test stage. More importantly, it is difficult to understand the resulting instability with limited data from the model test.|","equilibrium,  CFD,  FPSO,  course stability,  hydrodynamic derivative, Towing,  offshore structure"

The RobCutt-I has good maneuverability and can perform multiple motion modes, especially submerging or surfacing vertically in the water. A course controller and a depth controller for the RobCutt-I were proposed based on the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) technique. Experiments conducted on the RobCutt-I prototype validated the feasibility and effectiveness of the mechanism and control system. Simulations and experiments conducted on the RobCutt-I prototype showed that both the course controller and depth controller give better performance than the PID controller. |Introduction |Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have been used as an operation tool in many fields of marine activity such as submarine rescue, oil and gas survey, scientific research, and military application. Motivated by an interest in designing an agile and environmentally friendly AUV, many researchers and engineers have been dedicated to designing a Biomimetic Underwater Vehicle (BUV), which utilizes an undulatory fin for propulsion because the undulatory fin offers several advantages such as low acoustic noise, low disturbance of the surrounding environment, and great maneuverability. |In recent years, many BUVs with undulatory fins have been designed (Low, 2009; Zhou et al., 2010; Curet et al., 2011; Shang et al., 2012; Rahman et al., 2013). Some of these BUVs can swim only on the water surface, while others have three-dimensional locomotion ability. However, the heave speed is usually small because heave motion is often obtained by changing the center of gravity or adjusting the angle of attack of a dedicated caudal fin. The above methods need auxiliary mechanisms except for the undulatory fins and increase the complexity to a certain extent. Therefore, it is of great significance to design a new BUV that has better maneuverability. |For a practical BUV working in the 3D underwater space, its course and depth are two basic factors for navigation or operation in a fixed location. Hence, the course and depth should be precisely controlled so that the BUV can complete its task successfully. To our knowledge, however, few studies have presented an approach to precisely control the course or depth (Xie et al., 2011). Therefore, robust and precise course and depth controllers need to be designed to improve the operability of the BUV. |In view of the aforementioned issues, this paper focuses on two aspects. The first one is to design a new type of BUV, the RobCutt-I, based on our previously designed BUV (Wei et al., 2013). Compared to the previous designs by other research groups, the main contributions and differences of the RobCutt-I are: (1) the RobCutt-I can swim freely in 3D underwater space, relying solely on its two flexible long fins, while the previous designs require additional mechanisms such as a buoyancy tank or tail rudders to achieve heave motion; and (2) the RobCutt-I can submerge or surface quickly and vertically in water, which increases the maneuverability. In contrast, the previous designs can submerge or surface only slowly, and they need a relatively long time to change depth or have to march at the same time. |The second aspect is to propose methods to precisely control the course and depth of the RobCutt-I. The course controller and depth controller are designed based on the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) technique (Gao, 2003; Han, 2009). The basic idea of this control method is to estimate the general disturbances, including external disturbances, and model uncertainties in real time by the use of an Extended State Observer (ESO) and then dynamically compensate them in the control signal. |In this paper, the mechanism design and control system of the RobCutt-I, the RobCutt-I prototype, and its mathematical model are introduced. A course controller and a depth controller are then proposed based on the ADRC technique discussed in the following section. Simulations of the model of the RobCutt-I and experiments conducted on the RobCutt-I prototype are then presented. The conclusions of this study are lastly presented.|","Biomimetic underwater vehicle (BUV),  depth control,  undulating fin,  course control,  Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC)"

In this study, the graded proppant injection has been coupled with hydraulic fracturing treatment for enhancing conductivity of micro-fractures and cleats around the hydraulically induced fractures in coal bed methane reservoirs. In this technique, placing ultra-fine proppant particles in natural fractures and cleats around hydraulically induced fractures at leak-off conditions keeps the coal cleats open during water-gas production and consequently increases the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing treatment. |Experimental studies and mathematical modelling for stimulation of natural cleat system around the main hydraulic fracture are conducted. In the laboratory study, core flooding tests are performed to inject flow of suspended particles inside the natural fractures of a coal sample. By placing different particle sizes and evaluating concentration of placed particles, an experimental coefficient is found for optimum proppant placement in which the maximum permeability is achieved after proppant placement. In the mathematical modelling study, a laboratory based mathematical model for graded peroppant placement in naturally fractured rocks around a hydraulically induced fracture is proposed. Derivations of the model include exponential form of the pressure-permeability dependence and accounts for permeability variation in the non-stimulated zone. The explicit formulae are derived for well productivity index by including the experimentally found coefficient. |Particle placement tests result in almost three times increase in coal permeability. The laboratory-based mathematical modelling as performed for the field conditions shows that the proposed method yields around 6-times increase in productivity index.|","Hydraulic fracturing, Natural fracture system, Coal bed methane, Stimulation, Proppant particle"
