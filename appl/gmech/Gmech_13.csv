There has been a growing interest in measuring the cement bond quality quantitatively with LWD sonic tools. Recent studies have shown that quantitative cement evaluation with an LWD tool is feasible up to a certain bond index depending on conditions. In this paper we present several methods developed to identify the reliability of bond index computation with the current LWD sonic tools. The methods utilize information on the amplitude, transit time, and attenuation of the sonic waveforms acquired along a receiver array, as well as extensive modeling using the finite-difference method. The theoretical studies have been validated with real data recorded during some field test experiments that are also presented. The answer product based on these methods provides bond index values within the measurement range in conjunction with various quality control plots to provide confidence to the user on the validity of the answer.|","Document Type

Wellbore instability is a major challenge for the engineer evaluating the borehole and formation conditions during drilling. Instability issue is especially important to understand in areas with high stress variations, significant structure anisotropy, or pre-existing fractures system. Borehole (in)stability is influenced by rock strength, structural properties, and the interaction with far and near field principal stresses. During drilling, the borehole conditions also impact borehole integrity. Factors that we can measure in the borehole during with logging while drilling (LWD) to understand these conditions include the mud weight, mud loss, ROP (Rate of Penetration), RPM (Rotation Per Minute), WOB (Weight on Bit), and TORQ (Power swivel torque value). 
We conducted borehole instability analysis for Site C0002A and C0002F of the Nankai Trough transect based on riser and riserless drilling during IODP Expedition 338. The borehole shape, determined from LWD resistivity images, indicated the most of drilling occurred in low stress level environments, however in a few instances the bottom hole assembly became stuck. We used our geomechanical model to evaluate the required drilling parameters. Which related to estimate rock strength and measure physical properties. Based on our analysis, we interpret that borehole instability during IODP Expedition 338 may have been caused by weak bedding plane and fluid overpressure state. Furthermore we suggested the optimized drilling processes for the future deep drilling based on the simulation results from this model.|","Document Type

In several locations in the world the petrophysical analysis of hydrocarbon reservoirs is complicated by the presence of sands derived from volcanic sources.  The interpretation of the fluids present in such rock is problematic in many ways as is the identification of potential reservoirs themselves.  One particular example is the Cook Inlet in Alaska.  This is a fluvial depositional system with sands, shales and silt, rich in minerals with a volcanic origin.  There are also many coal layers present and these are the source rock for these mainly gas reservoirs.  Several fields have clearly identifiable gas and oil-bearing zones and these have been well produced.  Operators are now actively searching for those more complex hydrocarbon zones that may have been overlooked in the past and also for information to help to update the reservoir models based on which zones still have gas present and to identify fault barriers in currently producing zones. 
The presence of sand reservoirs containing a high percentage of volcanic minerals and lithoclasts causes problems with standard gamma ray interpretation. Also, low and variable salinity result in Rw variation that are not predictable and wet zones that may have anomalously high resistivity. There are additional problems with the interpretation of density/neutron information to identify gas pay as the presence of volcanic minerals will tend to inhibit the occurrence of the neutron-density cross-over.  The use of compressional and shear sonic data in combination with standard log interpretation is key to understanding these zones.  In the studied well the presence of the coal layers and the associated poor wellbore and logging conditions, along with the wellbore deviation, meant that running wireline-conveyed sonic logging tools was not the preferred option.  Instead the full logging suite was acquired using logging-while drilling (LWD) technology.  Recently developed multi-pole LWD sonic tools are now able to deliver consistent shear data across a wide range of formation travel times, along with high-quality compressional data. The examples shown demonstrate the problems with interpreting fluid content without the sonic data and the conclusions that would be drawn in this case. The addition of compressional and shear data is shown to improve the interpretation and to identify potential reservoirs that would otherwise have been overlooked.  The sonic data are also shown to provide information on previous production zones that are now depleted and swept by water, thus helping in understanding regional connectivity developing reservoir production strategies.|","Document Type

Shale reservoirs are being actively exploited in several tectonically stressed regions around the world. These tectonic settings often mean that the development of these fields requires an adequate quantification of the in situ principle stress magnitudes and their orientation. Achieving this goal can be complicated by the heterogeneous, inelastic, and/or anisotropic mechanical properties of these shales and the associated vertical and lateral variation in pore pressure and stress through the target zones and bounding intervals. For these reasons, the commonly used techniques of determining stress state from mini-frac type data and using this data to calibrate log derived stress profiles may be misleading unless certain additional factors are measured and considered. We present some case study workflow examples from productive shales in tectonically stressed settings where a more rigorous analysis of the injection test data and of the shale petrophysical properties has allowed an improved, more accurate assessment of stress state. In particular, utilizing well testing theory in the analysis of mini-frac data has given us additional understanding of hydraulic fracture behavior in some tectonically stressed shales. Horizontal fracture growth through shear activation of bedding-parallel fabric can be a preferred fracture propagation mechanism in these shales and this behavior can be diagnosed by this improved workflow. Anisotropic mechanical fabric of these shales can be measured in core more regularly and more efficiently due to recent instrumentation advances. These improvements allow for a more accurate distinction between the impact of rock fabric anisotropy and of stress induced acoustic anisotropy on modern sonic logging tool response.|","shale, anisotropy, geomechanics, tectonic stress, minifrac"

The success of commercial production of shale gas/oil in North America encourages other countries, such as China to replicate the U.S. shale gas revolution. The Sichuan Basin located in southwest of China is one of the largest proven shale formations with complex tectonics compared with US shale plays. The shale has natural fractures and local Earth stress is complex. The high formation stresses make initiating hydraulic fractures difficult. Therefore, very high surface fracturing pressure and high horsepower is needed to perform large scale fracturing jobs and initiate hydraulic fractures. 
There are two types of shale formations in the Sichuan Basin, one is a lacustrine formation that is not a common formation globally to produce hydrocarbons and the other a marine formation. A couple of appraisal wells have been successfully drilled and fractured with commercial gas production rates in both formations. One horizontal shale gas appraisal well in the lacustrine formation was drilled with 4,102 meters (13,454ft) in total measured depth (MD), 3,088 meters (10,129ft) in true vertical depth (TVD) and 815meters (2,673 ft) in horizontal section. The 10-stage ball-activated sleeves and open hole packers system were chosen as the multistage fracturing completion design. Based upon the research and analysis of this formation, the largest ever shale gas frac operation in China was completed in January, 2013. A total of 265.7m3 (990,000lbs) of proppant and 8625.5m3 (2,278,616 gals) of frac fluid were pumped into the target formation with a maximum surface fracturing pressure of 61MPa (8,847psi) and a pump rate of 12.4 m3/min (77.9 bbls/min). This frac operation set 2 new records in China for the proppant tonnage and the frac fluid volume.  
This paper will provide a comprehensive view of this successful fracturing operation in the lacustrine formation including formation evaluation, fracturing design and fracturing completion strategy such as determining the optimal number of frac stages per lateral, proppant type and mesh size, volumes of proppant pumped on each stage, fracture completion tool, fracturing fluid type, and injection rate.  The success of the fracturing job in this well marks a new breakthrough in gas field exploration in the Sichuan lacustrine formation and provides a guideline for future shale gas frac operations in similar formations or blocks.  
Introduction 
Due to rapid development in the last few decades, China is one of the most energy hungry countries in the world. To date, China is still heavily reliant on coal for energy which severely affects pollution, emissions and efficiency. To address these problems, the government has become more and more aware of the need to change energy consumption composition, i.e. reduce coal usage and increase use of natural gas. What is important is that China has great potential for natural gas production, especially for shale gas.    
In China, compared with marine formations from which a large amount of oil and gas has been produced, very limited attention has been paid to lacustrine formations, such as the Xujiahe formation in Sichuan Basin where there exists good conditions for potential commercial reservoirs. As the shale gas industry in North America has successfully developed and been leading the world, learning from North America is a good choice to accelerate shale gas development for China. Based on these considerations, the well in this case study was intended to be drilled as one of appraisal wells to find out the commercial production potential of the Xujiahe formation and execute a multistage hydraulic fracturing based on applying US technology and experience. |","multistage, FRACTURING"

Piah, Mohamad Faizzudin, PETRONAS","|Abstract 
A thorough 3D finite-element (FE) geomechanical study was over undertaken for an oil and gas field offshore Sarawak, Malaysia, to assist the development management. The field comprises eight major reservoirs with three of them planned for water injection to improve recovery. The historical well drilling data, wireline logs, production data, field tests and newly obtained laboratory test data provided inputs for deriving a wellbore-based 1D geomechanical model for the field. The 1D model was calibrated to well drilling observations before being up-scaled and populated in a 3D geomechanical model for the entire field. The model was implemented in an FE simulator to dynamically analyze reservoir compactions, platform site subsidence, fault reactivation potential and cap rock breaches that might be induced by reservoir depletion and injection in the full life cycle planning of the field management. 
The results showed a maximum subsidence of 0.72 m above the shallowest depleting reservoir and a subsidence of approximately 0.62 m at the seabed in year 2032. Injection slightly reverses the subsidence induced by depletion and the subsidence at the centre of the seabed is approximately 0.58 m in year 2050. The corresponding subsidence at the platform sites reaches 0.58 m in year 2032 and reduces to 0.54 m in year 2050. Depletion tends to reduce fault reactivation potential within the depleting and close underlying intervals, but enhances fault slip likelihood near the upper bounding zones. Faults segments bounding the deepest producing reservoir, which contains the most depletion, is predicted to have the highest potential for fault shearing in the late stages of production. Injection reverses the trend of fault reactivationpotential. There are no caprock integrity issues with the three main injection reservoirs for the entire field life. 
Introduction 
The study field is in offshore Sarawak, Malaysia and truncated by two sets of major faults with one set (Alpha) in the south and the other (Beta and Gamma) in the north of the field.  There are dozens of hydrocarbon-bearing zones separately deposited in the upper to lower coastal plain environments of interbedded sandstones, shales and siltstones. The shallower zones comprise gas reservoirs; intermediate reservoirs exhibit small oil rims; and deep reservoirs show gas condensate. Eight reservoirs, labelled as R1, R2,  and R8, have been either in production, or in water injection, or within future production consideration. Fig. 1 shows the plan and cross-section views of the field structure. 
After the field discovery in 1967, production commenced in 1972 from three major reservoirs: R4, R5 and R6, with R6 started water injection since 1994 follow by R4 and R5- in 2017. In addition, the other 5 reservoirs, including a deeper overpressured pure gas reservoir, R8, will begin production in 2017. Thereafter, depletion and recharge of pressure is expected from multiple reservoirs undergoing either production or injection. 
Pressure depletion from production or pressure recharge because of injection induces stress changes in the depleting/injecting reservoirs and their bounding formations. Consequently, the stress changes in multiple reservoirs and bounding zones can induce various geomechanical problems, e.g., wellbore drilling instability, sand production, reservoir compaction, overburden subsidence, fault reactivation and caprock fracturing. Those geomechanical issues can impact well planning, platform facilitating and production management for future field development.|","depletion, injection, compaction, subsidence, 3D dynamic modelling, fault reactivation, Geomechanics, Enhanced oil recovery"

A major challenge facing the oil and gas drilling operations is mitigating the encountered wellbore instability issues. Those can vary from loss circulations up to having stuck pipes or tools that may jeopardize well integrity and potentially lead to total loss of wells and assets. These problematic situations are even much more complicated in fractured reservoir environments where predicting the fracture density is important.  Analyzing such problems is critical for companies especially in developing offshore fields where one day lost time is in hundreds of thousands of dollars. The field of rock mechanics emerged to connect those phenomena to reservoir rock properties and stress profiles. Coupling this with an intensive analysis of drilling parameters, logging, core testing and other existing wells data builds a work frame that helps in understanding the reasons behind wellbore failures and providing solutions to them. The field under investigation is a highly geo-pressured offshore gas field. The field development called for drilling vertical and deviated wells. During the field increment sever loss circulation were encountered that resulted in lost drilling times estimated in millions of US dollars with rig cost up $ 200,000/Day. Other drilling failures includes, stuck drill pipe and difficulties with logging response and log interpretation. The objective of this study is to investigate the wellbore instability during drilling operations as function of rock properties, in-situ earth stress and drilling parameters. Emphasis on the role of natural fractures density will be highlighted and included in modeling inputs as well as characterizing its density across the field. During the course of the study, existing fields and drilled wells available data will be analyzed and a simulation models will be utilized to simulate the stress profiles in the field. Based on the results, the factors behind the instability issues in the field will be identified and recommendations will be made for future wells drilling programs.|","Gas, Fractured, Wellbore Instabilities, Rock Mechanics, Offshore"

With increasing focus on exploration in tight and low-permeability environs, formation evaluation today has become more challenging. Integrating all measurements and understanding and evaluating uncertainties are critical for an effective evaluation workflow. Such a workflow should deliver the productivity and completion strategy for an effective exploitation of reserves. The field under study is an exploratory field located in the East China Sea, and the play is an anticline along a north-south axis. The main zone of interest is in a giant sandstone formation with very low porosity. Since this is a potentially large accumulation, it was necessary to produce gas to surface to confirm the discovery and book reserves. 
In this study, an effective Reservoir Quality (RQ), Completion Quality (CQ) workflow is developed and executed to address the formation evaluation objectives in challenging environments. Integrating core measurements with petrophysical evaluation leads to an effective estimate of the petro physical properties and a quantitative estimate of the uncertainties involved. These uncertainties are then taken forward into a reservoir model to estimate the productivity from these sands. Geomechanical analysis is done to evaluate various completion options including hydraulic fracturing and an estimate of the post-fracturing productivity is evaluated for various fracturing scenarios. With this evaluation, an informed decision on the best way to exploit reserves was made. We present this study as an example of how various formation evaluation measurements can be integrated into a well deliverability workflow in a tight gas reservoir.

The Changqing field is one of the largest fields in China, yet it is characterized by low permeability, low initial pressure, and low reservoir quality. During the past few years, technological advancements within the oil industry, horizontal drilling, and hydraulic fracture stimulation have helped create a development boom in this field, with total production of barrel of oil equivalence (BOE) reaching 50 million tons in 2013. 
Located in the Ordos basin of China, the primary pay formation of the Changqing field is Triassic, which features a complicated sedimentary system. 72.8% of reservoirs in the Changqing field have permeability lower than 1.0 md. Although it was apparent that all of these wells would require fracture treatments to help achieve optimum production, it was difficult to identify a routine treatment design or fracturing strategy to extend to all of the reservoirs because the Changqing field has 19 oilfields and three gas fields stretching over five provinces. The sediment source of the pay formation varies in terms of direction and lithology, and all of the sedimentary systems vary from fan delta to braided stream delta systems. 
To maximize well production, it is necessary to analyze the differences among these fields and identify the most favorable fracture treatment design for each field. Microseismic mapping has proven to be a valuable technology for assessing and optimizing the fracture treatment by describing fracture geometry. This paper introduces a real-time microseismic mapping project conducted on a multistage fracture treatment in a specific tight sand reservoir of Changqing; during this project, a quantifying relationship between the fracture treatment parameters and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) was realized, enabling stimulation optimization in this area. This paper details the microseismic mapping acquisition, hydraulic fracture symmetry, practical drainage pattern, evaluation of the fracture treatment parameters, and perforation strategy that impact fracture geometry and SRV as well as optimization in this particular tight sand reservoir. 
Introduction 
Located in northern middle China, the Ordos basin (Fig. 1) is the second largest depositional basin, covering an aerial extent of approximately 370,000 square kilometers, stretching across the Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia, with original oil in place (OOIP) of approximately 8.6 billion tons. The Ordos basin is a superimposed basin having experienced multiple tectonic movements. The stratigraphic fill of the Ordos basin is composed of numerous facies. These types vary between Carbonate Platform, Clastic sedimentary of Paleozoic, fluvial, delta, and lacustrine of Mesozoic; its total thickness is approximately 5000m. In the Ordos basin, hydrocarbon contribution formations of Triassic and Jurassic produce oil; whereas, Permo-Carboniferous and Ordovician produce gas. Across the entire board of the basin, oil reservoirs are distributed in the southern portion, while gas reservoirs are abundant in the northern part. Because of complex tectonics characteristics and low permeability, reaching its current total production of BOE of 50 million tons per year proved overwhelmingly difficult. Before the 1950s, it took 50 years to achieve production of 2,000 tons per year; it then took another 20 years to achieve production reaching 20,000 tons. Even up to the year 2000, production was only 7.5 million tons per year. In the last 10 years, as conventional sources of oil and gas have declined, operators have been driven to explore unconventional resources globally, and the Changqing field had made astonishing progress during this period.|","Microseismic Mapping, Tight Sand, Fracture Geometry"

In order to economically develop the Albian Carbonate Macae formation in the Campos Basin Deepwater Brazil an extended reach horizontal well is required.  Due to the tight nature (low permeability) of the rock, stimulation of the reservoir is required.  Completion designs and techniques for treating extended reach horizontal wells in deepwater are limited.   Most applications for these type wells in Deepwater are ineffective (high skin/low PI) and inefficient (trip/time intensive) affecting project economics.  A completion system was developed that allows for safe, effective and efficient stimulation and installation of such an extended reach horizontal well in Deepwater.  
This paper will describe the design, testing and execution of a unique Deepwater completion system that adapts a known multi-stage ball drop system used in onshore unconventional reservoirs, for example the US and Canada, to a known horizontal open hole sand control system to effectively matrix acidize a 2000 m horizontal open hole thru a Limited Entry Liner with  reservoir segmentation. The system uses a Retrievable Ball Drop Diversion System (RBDDS) consisting of multi-stage frac sleeves run on wash pipe.  The RBDDS is run inside a limited entry liner that is segmented into stages or intervals by openhole programmable interventionless packers (Mendes et al. 2014) all run in a single trip and with no pipe manipulation required while stimulating.  It furthermore leaves behind a robust lower completion system for the life of the field. 
This 2000 m lower completion system was successfully run in the Albian Carbonate reservoir and all stages treated with 15% HCl with minimal NPT, no harm to people or environment.  At the time of completion, this well was the longest horizontal reservoir section and longest step out well drilled and completed in Brazil.  This Limited Entry Liner System together with the RBDDS proved to be a very efficient, effective and deepwater friendly system. 
Introduction 
Low permeable deepwater carbonate reservoirs have created many challenges to produce economically.  The wells typically require extensive reservoir contact that has to be stimulated in order to achieve an acceptable Productivity Index, PI.  Field A, Albian Carbonate in the Campos basin offshore Brazil falls into this challenging category.  Effectively stimulating long horizontals has long been an industry challenge onshore and even more so in a deepwater environment.  With the advent of Unconventionals in the US and Canada the ability to stimulate long horizontals has generated a great deal of focus and effort over the last few years.  The high rate and multi-stage fracture stimulations done on these wells has resulted in the development of new industry techniques, notably using frac sleeves operated by dropping balls, and pumping down plugs and perforating guns to isolate and perforate each stage.  
This paper will review the concept selection process, detailed design work, testing, and implementation results of an extended reach horizontal well that utilizes onshore Unconventional ball drop technology adapted to a Deepwater setting to effectively stimulation a 2000 m long horizontal section.  The well and stimulation treatment was considered an apparaisal effort such that if the production from the well is suitable it will open up the full Albian Carbonate for further development.       |","Limited Entry, Extended reach Stimulation System, Deepwater Horizontal Completion system, Carbonate"

Proper reservoir characterization and sweet spots identification for unconventional reservoirs need to be performed considering both geomechanical and petrophysical properties. 
This paper describes the integrated application of tools and technologies developed within eni internal research project on US Barnett shale gas. 
eni shale gas reservoir modeling has been performed by using a geologic workflow to link the petrophysical characterization and the seismic data at wellbore scale and consistently distribute these properties at field scale by means of a seismic trend. This is the key to obtain a predictive geological model. 
In addiction, an engineering workflow that merges hydraulic fracture treatment, microseismic survey and advanced production analysis (APA) was set up. 
Thus the input parameters for dynamic simulation, focusing on the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) estimation, may be obtained. 
A sector model was extracted from the full field geological model for dynamical simulation purposes. 
A single porosity-like approach was adopted to couple the advantage of dual permeability and single porosity models. 
As a first step, the History Match (HM) of gas production data and flowback water rates, was performed both at single well and pad scale. This allowed the tuning of SRV extension and permeability of the induced fractures. In addition, a comparison of gas reserves obtained by decline curve analysis and simulation model was performed. 
Moreover, by using the calibrated sector model, a series of sensitivities was carried out focusing on well landing and spacing in order to achieve an optimal pad design. 
The strength of this study lies on the integrated model approach. It is an efficient tool to drive and optimize the field development plan, allowing the definition of optimal wells spacing and lateral length, positively affecting economics. Finally, it is a robust approach to reduce uncertainties in gas reserves assessment. 
Introduction 
The largest part of global discovered hydrocarbon resources is stored in so called Unconventional reservoirs, that need advanced technologies, such as horizontal wells, multistage completion and hydraulic fracturing, to be successfully exploited at economic rate. 
This work focuses on unconventional gas shale reservoirs that are present worlwide. Nowadays, many efforts are ongoing in order to better understand their nature and the complex physical phenomena involved in the production, thus improving field development strategies.

The aim was to deliver a more structured and business oriented technology to build a reliable and predictive model able to support and optimize management decisions in such complex systems (e.g. sweet spot definition, well positioning, completion,

The Devonian strata of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin has a wealth of potential hydrocarbon source rocks including the unconventional Upper Devonian Duvernay Formation of the Woodbend Group, a prolific oil-producing formation that has fed into the overlying strata. The Duvernay Formation has seen investments of over $7 billion since 2010 for land rights, corporate acquisitions/divestures and drilling activity. The Kaybob area is currently the center of exploration and production in the play with over 100 wells drilled or licensed. Notable operators include Athabasca, Encana, Talisman, Shell, Chevron, Conoco Phillips, Husky and Celtic/Exxon. One of the pioneering wells at Kaybob South (Celtic et al. HZ 15-33-60-20W5) tested 2.1 mmcf/d of gas with 75 bbls/mmcf of 560 API condensate at a reservoir pressure of 63 MPA (~19 KPa/m pressure gradient). Exploration companies are touting GIP reserves ranging wildly from 45 to >200 bcf/section. Despite the positive initial production numbers, the Kaybob area has a complex geological and stratigraphic framework that needs to be understood. Thermal maturity of the organic matter in the Duvernay Formation ranges from immature in the eastern portion of the basin to dry-gas window in the west. Hence, location of each well is key to optimizing the production potential. Here we present new rock property data of wells along a transect from the oil-prone to the dry gas-prone area in the Kaybob area and compare the properties with the existing hydrocarbon production information. Rock composition, fabric, organic matter content and maturity as well as amount, distribution and size of pores and pore networks are evaluated. The data is displayed in a stratigraphic context and current production zones are highlighted. The discussion also integrates the thermal history and possible tectonic overprints of the area to evaluate the potential of developing production through the various thermal maturity zones and the possible hydrocarbon storage/flow of these rocks. |","thermal maturity, porosity, Duvernay, unconventional, rock properties"

Widely recognized as the world leader in crude oil production, Saudi Aramco has only recently begun to explore for unconventional gas resources.  Saudi Aramco started evaluating its unconventional reservoirs to meet the anticipated future demands for natural gas. One of the subject plays that is currently being evaluated is a carbonate source rock with nanodarcy permeability and very low porosity. The target formation has few, if any, analogs that can be used for comparison. Knowledge of the formation characteristics, geomechanics, stimulation response and production potential has been nonexistent until recently.  Historically, all attempts to hydraulically fracture stimulate carbonate formations in Kingdom have resulted in premature screen-outs.  This paper will discuss the hydraulic fracturing stimulation design, execution and evaluation of the first successful proppant fracturing treatment in an unconventional carbonate source rock in Saudi Arabia. The successful two-stage treatment proved that proppant fracturing techniques could be utilized to stimulate carbonate formations after modifying the stimulation design, specifically the perforation strategy, fracturing fluids and proppant type. The Tuwaiq Mountain and Jubailah formations were treated with 104,000 lbs and 114,956 lbs of proppant respectively. 
INTRODUCTION 
Saudi Aramcos unconventional gas exploration efforts were influenced by the growing local gas demand and the economic success of shale exploration in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. Saudi Aramco started evaluating its unconventional reservoirs and their potential to reduce oil consumption in the electricity sector and to fuel the anticipated future demands for natural gas. 
The multi-stage fracturing technique has facilitated the development of shale gas and light tight oil production in the United States and is believed to do so in the other countries with unconventional hydrocarbon resources (1). 
Saudi Aramco has embarked on an unconventional exploration and appraisal project to assess its unconventional resources potential in three geographic areas, Northwest, South Ghawar and East Ghawar.  Hydraulic fracturing techniques will be utilized to enhance production by connecting natural fissures and creating high connectivity pathways for gas to flow into the well. |","Unconventional, carbonate, saudi arabia, fracture"

Upper Zubair Horizontal wells in North Kuwait pose a unique challenge; the challenge of building angle at High DLS, to achieve horizontal profile within short section of TVD. While normal DLS in Horizontal wells had been in the range of 5-7 deg. /100ft. in the 8<U+00BD> section, the planned DLS to achieve the horizontal in upper zubair required a Build of 10-11 deg. /100 ft. This exceeded the capacity of normal Rotary Steerable Systems and it was something which was never attempted before in the entire Middle East region.  Kuwait Oil Company strived for technological solutions and successfully carried out the job. 
The need for sharp DLS arises primarily to counter the complications from formations in the section previous to it. High angle of inclination through shaly formations compounded with total loss, leads to quick destabilization of the hole creating an unstable hole. These issues enforce a strategy of not building beyond 400 inclination at the casing point, leaving the onus of building to horizontal in a short section of TVD.  Completion strategies with ICD and Swell Packers in the lateral further tightened these requirements to a very smooth curve. 
With proper operational control, the curve section was drilled with a proprietary RSS along with a specialized bit, cased and cemented successfully. Later the successful deployment of a stiff ICD completion proved the portability of this success to other challenging projects. The total savings realized on account of lesser directional work is over $700,000 US. 
The paper outlines the planning efforts, risk assessment and operational details in achieving success. With capabilities of reaching DLS of 150/100 ft. through these special RSS systems, new vistas have opened up for drilling of such challenging profiles. Sharper profiles with lower Kick-Offs could have huge potential for optimization in terms of lower directional costs and cycle times.|","Rotary Steerable Systems, Well Design, Directional Drilling"

In tight reservoirs development such as shale gas it is important and yet difficult to predict the size and orientation of the drainage area around a hydraulically fractured well. Often the drainage area is determined by near-well fractures. Diagnostic fracture injection test (DFIT) is an effective way of predicting many reservoir parameters. However, it is challenging to uniquely interpret fractures geometry, dimension and spacing. A forward model is desired to correlate the DFIT responses with different fracture configurations and the associated drainage area. 
We present a 2D model that couples fluid flow with geomechanical deformations in hydraulically fractured reservoirs by solving Biot's equation. Both fluid pressure/velocity and deformations are solved on a finite element mesh. Fracture space is distinguished from the rest of the matrix by high porosity/permeability and low elastic strength. The FEM mesh is adaptively refined at the fractured area to allow the fractures to be reasonably thin and arbitrarily spaced. Pseudo time iteration is applied to seek for convergence between fracture opening/closure and fluid pressure changes. DFIT is simulated with the new numerical model with a single (bi-wing) fracture case and a complex fracture case. The complex fracture case is made by adding transverse fractures to the two wings of a single fracture. The numerical results reveal pressure changes of reservoir fluid due to matrix and fracture deformations as well as due to fluid leak-off. The model is able to generate synthetic well pressure data that show all the type curves given by analytical DFIT theory. The complex fracture case results in pressure transient such that the flow regime rapidly evolves into pseudo-radial flow. 
For idealized bi-wing fracture cases, this model is consistent with existing analytical tools for DFIT interpretation. The advantages of this model are the ability to implement complex fractures, and the ability to extend to 3D for non-vertical fractures (briefly mentioned in the appendices). 
Synthetic DFIT data from the model developed in this study has been compared to a field example from a shale gas reservoir. The discrepancy between the model result and field example suggests that some special constitutive law is needed for the modeled fracture areas to appropriately capture the real fracture closure process. 
Introduction 
When a well is subjected to production or fracturing injection, the fluid flow is likely accompanied by the solid deformation. In most cases of conventional reservoirs, the initial pore volume is much larger than the volume changes that are caused by the matrix strain with competent rock grains. For this reason, the fluid flow is often modeled independently without coupling with deformation. In the cases of tight and shale gas reservoirs however, the pore volume is comparable to the strain caused volume changes. The fluid flow modeling then needs to be coupled with the solid deformation. 
We present our work on modeling a hydraulically fractured reservoir subjected to production or injection, where the fluid and solid are coupled by solving Biot's equation. The model is capable of generating synthetic well test data that show all the characteristic type curves given by the analytical DFIT theory.

Development wells for this field are in excess of 6500m in true vertical depth. Stimulation is required to provide production rates that compensate for the high cost of drilling and completing wells. Hydraulic fracture design and execution must be optimal to ensure economic production. |To effectively stimulate a more than 200 m thick sandstone reservoir with consistently high performance, it is necessary to understand the mechanical behaviour of the reservoir, especially mechanical properties and in-situ stresses as the two control initiation and propagation of each hydraulic fracture.

This paper describes a new anisotropic wellbore stability model and its application in a challenging shale gas well in China. Wells drilled through laminated rocks like shales particularly deviated wells such as laterals - are often less stable than comparable wells drilled into non-laminated rocks. This results in significant wellbore instability issues that can elevate drilling operation costs substantially. Traditional wellbore stability analysis considers the formation as a homogeneous isotropic material using isotropic elastic near wellbore stresses together with isotropic borehole failure criteria such as Mohr-Coulomb. In anisotropic rocks, for example in highly laminated shales and fractured rocks, those models are no longer valid as borehole failure can occur along weak planes. 
We have developed such an anisotropic wellbore stability model in which the rock anisotropic elastic properties and anisotropic strength characteristic are incorporated. Near borehole induced stress is computed by Lekhnitskii-Amadei solution to account formation anisotropic behavior, and wellbore shear failure mechanism is modeled by a modified Plane-of-Weakness model, where the classical Plane-of-Weakness failure criterion is adopted to identify the onset of rock sliding along a weak plane; and the active shearing effect is adopted to judge whether the onset sliding at the borehole wall will develop and cause borehole instability. Arbitrary bedding/fracture orientations as well as arbitrary wellbore trajectory and in situ stress orientation is considered by this model. The model can predict the extent of failure region around the wellbore and then provide mud weight window for safe and effective drilling. 
Additionally, this approach was programmed into a software system and applied to a field case study - wellbore stability analysis and mud weight computation for a slightly deviated pilot well drilling through laminated shales.  The laminated shales are penetrated by high-angle natural fractures. Our modeling results shows the design borehole can be drilled without encounting severe instability issue, however, borehole damage due to either weak planes (laminated layers and fractures) sliding or rock matrix shear failure were predicted. The borehole damage mode and severity is largely dependent on borehole relative orientation with the weak planes, and the directions and magnitudes of the in situ three principal stresses. The computed borehole damage was compared to borehole image (FMI) and caliper measurement and gave a good agreement.  Subsequently this model was applied to predict the mud weight window for an Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) in the field and provide wellbore stability analysis to drill high-deviated wells in the area. We showed that this developed model is effective to provide insight in understanding borehole failure mechanisms, and provide more reasonable mud weight window which can be used to effectively mitigate wellbore instabilities in anisotropic condition.|","shale gas well, wellbore stability, wellbore failure mechanism, anisotropic model, analytical solution"

The drilling induced tensile fractures can be observed from borehole image logs but they must be differentiated from natural fractures. This paper focuses on the understanding of hydraulically or artificially induced tensile fractures while drilling. We present an inversion method using rigorous principles of mechanics, to determine the in-situ formation stress state from observed induced tensile fractures. Contrary to common practices where only vertical or near vertical wells can be analysed, the present method is applicable to wellbores of all orientations. For a geological rock formation and area where the in-situ stress regime can be assumed to be similar, all the relevant borehole image logs can be included to provide information to yield the most probable subsurface in-situ stress state. The proposed inversion method directly solves for the in-situ stress states given any single set of observed tensile fracture location and orientation. It provides not only an estimate for the minimum horizontal stress magnitude and direction, but also the maximum horizontal stress magnitude which is usually very difficult to pin down. The resultant equations are non-linear and a simple numerical scheme is adopted for the solution. Although published data on borehole images of fractures with corresponding in-situ stress information are scarce, two observed field data from published papers are chosen for comparison. 
Introduction 
In-situ stresses in deep rock formations reached equilibrium over geologic time; but drilling, production and injection processes cause deformation in the rock mass and change these stresses, and often negatively impact the operators development plan. If they are not well anticipated, the challenges and costs of managing a prospect can far exceed the initial field development expectation. Therefore, it is vital to characterize the undisturbed in-situ stress and evaluate potential impact of field development induced rock stress changes. Two examples that come to mind are 1) enhanced oil recovery field development where injection scheme takes place under hydraulic fracturing condition and 2), the development of unconventional resources such as shale gas, where the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing to access hydrocarbon is impacted by the in-situ stress regime. The latter, for instance, is encountered in China's Sichuan basin where operators are striving to determine whether hydraulic fractures in certain areas of the basin are developed under thrust-faulting or reverse-faulting stress regime (Yuan et al, 2013). A reverse-faulting stress regime implies that the hydraulic fractures would grow in a horizontal pancake fashion, diminishing its effectiveness in draining the reservoir.|","In-situ stress, rock mechanics, induced fractures, geomechanics"

Large accumulations of methane hydrates are known to exist in the deepwater Nankai Trough located off the southern coast of Japan. Due to its enormous potential as an energy source, there is growing interest in the production of methane gas from these deposits. An offshore production test was scheduled to test the technological viability to produce the methane hydrate by using a depressurization method. However, methane hydrate production may cause large amounts of compaction and subsidence, which can damage well integrity and cause loss of zonal isolation in the overburden. This condition could provide potential leakage pathways for methane gas to the surface and endanger offshore operations. 
The paper presents a study in which well integrity was evaluated for a methane hydrate production test well in the Nankai Trough. In this study, a new workflow was proposed and applied to honor both fieldwide formation heterogeneity and near-wellbore geometry. The geomechanics properties were determined through integration of seismic inversion data, log data, and core data from the Nankai Trough. Interface elements were installed between the casing and cement and the cement and formation to evaluate the impact of cement bond quality on the well integrity. The numerical simulation was conducted through coupling of the simulation results produced by a methane hydrate production simulator from a third party with a 3D finite-element (FE) geomechanics simulator. 
The study predicted the occurrence of 2-cm of subsidence on the seafloor generated by approximately 1.5% of reservoir compaction for a production test of 20 days. Over this period, casing would yield with a plastic strain of about 1%. Most findings indicated a low risk in the loss of zonal isolation which is consistent with the results of the production test conducted in March 2013. 
This simulation evaluated potential risks related to well integrity, and provided critical information for the preparation and execution of the pioneering offshore methane hydrate production test in the Nankai Trough. |","Nankai Trough, Well Integrity, Methane Hydrate"

Hydrocarbon production optimization in Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs is a main focus for oil and gas research in Brazil. Stimulation treatment design optimization requires good knowledge of the reservoir properties and excellent understanding of the interaction between rock formation and treating fluid. This paper investigates these interactions through laboratory tests determining the compatibility of fluids used in matrix stimulation with different Pre-Salt carbonate rock types. The objective of this work is to relate the geology, petrophysics, and geomechanics of the Pre-Salt reservoirs to their expected stimulation response. 
Because of the difficulty in obtaining downhole cores and the destructive nature of most tests, the study focused on samples collected from a Pre-Salt carbonate analog: the Coquinas formation (Schafer 1973) from the Sao Miguel quarry, northeast Brazil (Chagas de Azambuja Filho et al. 1998). A thorough geology-based study of the Coquinas formation, including routine core analysis (FZI) microtomography, and thin section study was conducted. Usually these grain-supported carbonates show different amounts and types of primary porosity, closed and reopened by multiple diagenetic phases. 
Throughout the 25-m thick Coquinas reservoir, five rock types in 13 layers with permeability ranging from microdarcy to almost 1 darcy were identified. All rock types were subjected to routine mineralogy evaluation and various petrophysical, geomechanical, and spectroscopic measurements. Six of the thirteen layers were selected to perform core flow tests with a viscoelastic surfactant technology based diverting acid fluid (Al-Mutawa et al. 2005; Chang et al. 2001; Samuel et al. 1997). This is the first extensive study reporting the efficiency of a viscoelastic diverting acid system in the Pre-Salt analogue Coquinas carbonate formation outcrop cores. Spectroscopic measurement showed wormhole creation and, in some cases, rock texture alteration or fine migration. Through the study we identified the flow units and characterized the rock behavior when chemically stimulated. The conclusions from this study will enable us to tailor and optimize stimulation treatments of Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs. 
Introduction 
The offshore Pre-Salt in Brazil comprises a group of recently discovered fields with promising oil reserves in the Coquinas formation or the above the microbialites section. For example, Lula (ex-Tupi) field, the lead field of the Santos cluster, is believed to hold between 5 to 8 billions barrels of oil equivalent (Beltrao et al. 2009). The Pre-Salt reservoirs are currently the focus of research in Brazil; however, the scarceness of downhole samples collected makes destructive tests very difficult to perform, and so analysis must be performed on analogues. The onshore Coquinas formation from northeast Brazil is taken here as analogue of the Pre-Salt carbonates.|","Stimulation, Pre-Salt, characterisation, analog, Carbonate"

Shell China Exploration and Production Company and its affiliates are operating in the pioneering Joint Cooperation Project (JCP) in the Sichuan Basin that targets unlocking the Lower Silurian Longmaxi shale gas play. Since 2010, both verticals and horizontals have been drilled and completed with various hydraulic fracturing technologies implemented. Supported by extensive data gathering and analysis, the hydraulic fracturing stimulation practices have significantly evolved to improve the quality and repeatability of completion results. This paper reviews the development of hydraulic fracturing stimulation practices in Longmaxi shale gas play in the studied area.  
Unlike most of the North American shale gas plays, the Longmaxi shale gas play is characterized by high formation pressures, close-to-overburden in-situ minimum stresses, low horizontal stress anisotropy, and regionally active tectonics, the combination of which presents unique challenges to hydraulic fracturing stimulation. The combination of these geologic, geomechanical and petrophysical characteristics result in high treating pressure, difficulty in proppant placement, constrained fracture height and complex fracture geometry. However, successful fracturing executions have been achieved by applying technologies including, but not limited to, limited entry perforation design and hybrid fluid systems, advanced monitoring including microseismic and Diagnostic Fracture Injection Test (DFIT) technique, etc. The completion parameters such as lateral length, stage spacing, number of clusters per stage, perforation shots per cluster, fluid type, fluid/proppant volume, treating rate, proppant selection have all been optimized as part of the learning curve.   
Key fracture design parameters such as the preferred treating rate, customized fluid design and pumping schedule for the play are discussed. This paper also demonstrates the learning of the fit-for-purpose hydraulic fracturing stimulation design from the perspective of successful and repeatable delivery of the fracture treatment.   
Introduction 
The lower Silurian Longmaxi black shale, characterized by organic-rich calcareous-siliceous shale with higher brittleness as well as abundant natural fractures distribution, is the main target for this joint cooperation project. High quartz and TOC content in conjunction with favorable porosity and permeability makes the lower section of Longmaxi shale the prime interval of interest.  
Comparing to shale gas play in North America, the TVD of Joint Cooperation Project (JCP) wells range from 3050m to 4500m; the pore pressure gradient is greater than 0.9 psi/ft, which is also higher than most of its counterparts in North America. However, the other geological and petrophysical parameters like formation thickness, Youngs modulus and Poisson ratio are comparable.  
Due to the low anisotropy of Shmax and Shmin (Yuan et al. 2013), the Longmaxi shale demonstrates diverse present-day horizontal stress direction across the block, reflecting the observed structural complexity. The in-situ stress, namely Shmin, overburden stress and Shmax are nearly isotropic resulting in mixed stress regimes. In some areas the Shmin can be close to or even higher than the overburden stress, which is confirmed by the closure gradients from DFIT. This may cause the fracture geometry to be bed parallel or pancake like. Meanwhile, complex fracture geometry (SRV type), rather than typical bi-wing, are diagnosed by microseismic monitoring. The total fracture height as diagnosed by non-radioactive tracers (NRT) and temperature logging in a vertical well indicated the hydraulically created fracture covering about only one thirds of total target thickness.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Sichuan, Completion, Shale Gas, Longmaxi"

Sdn. Bhd.| Howat, Craig, Talisman Malaysia Ltd.| Britton, Alan, Talisman Malaysia Ltd.","|Abstract 
The mature Kinabalu oilfield is currently producing 18,000 bopd from a peak of 40,000 bopd in 1998. Field rejuvenation plans include drilling and completing new infill and development wells from both the existing platform and a new platform. Most platform wells are currently producing sand and none have been completed with sand control. Although current levels are less than 10 pptb, sand production has caused erosion issues and lost production due to the need for regular separator clean outs on the existing platform. Sand production is therefore a key risk factor for both existing well integrity and new well completion design. An integrated, practical and pragmatic sand management strategy was developed founded on establishing the causes of sand production, predicting the conditions for sand failure, and ranking both passive and active sand control options. 
1D geomechanical models were built from field, core and well data. The sand failure analytical model was initially calibrated against existing well sand production records, then run for the proposed new wells to assess the potential for sand production over the remaining field life. The model was also used to evaluate passive alternatives to active sand exclusion completions. Modelling supported field observations that sand production is closely linked to reservoir depth, completion style, well inclination and, most importantly, depletion level  sand production is unlikely at initial pressure conditions but is triggered by depletion. 
The sand failure analyses were embedded in an objective screening protocol which was developed to rank sand control options. This considers existing and proposed well completion architecture, facilities design/limitations, and recognises inherent data uncertainties. This systematic methodology allows a consistent, objective and transparent view of benefits and risks across the different sand control system aspects. Key selection criteria were utilised rather than arbitrary decisions based on limited and often unaudited data. The process ensured a best practice, fit for purpose, and structured sand management solution. 
As the current levels of sand production remain low, and in response to the challenges associated with remedial or retro-fitting sand control, optimised surface sand management will continue to be the preferred solution for all existing wells. Improved bean up procedures have already reduced sand production at well start up after a shut down. 
Sand production in most new infill and development wells is predicted to be manageable. In the higher risk wells, targeting shallower or weaker sands, installing sand control would be the default position. Yet re-thinking the completion design, optimising surface sand management procedures, managing drawdown and BHFP levels, and taking advantage of favourable stress vectors through oriented perforation can extend the sand free well operating envelopes over life of well production and depletion conditions, reducing or deferring the need for sand control in all but the highest sanding risk reservoirs. The first infill well to be completed with oriented perforations in Kinabalu produced at 2500 bopd on test with minimal levels of sand. 
Installing downhole pressure gauges in infill wells have improved BHFP control within the critical well pressure operational envelope from the sand failure model. To date the wells have shown significantly lower sand production than historically seen on Kinabalu production wells.

In Australia, where the CBM or coal seam gas (CSG) industry is nearly two decades old, there have been successful and unsuccessful pilot projects and resources have been slower to develop after nearly twenty-five years since North American technologies were exported internationally. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that there are differences outside North America that have hindered CBM development in Australia. |Often CBM pilots owe their degree of success to one of three major factors: geologic or structural setting, reservoir properties, or completion strategies. Most pilot testing have been conducted either to characterize the production from a particular geo-domain associated with certain perceived geological risk and uncertainty or to estimate potential project reserves to a reasonable degree of accuracy. This need to reduce uncertainty is more pronounced in Australia based on the need to balance development decisions, tenure retention requirements, whilst minimising the risk for the upcoming development phase. |Often in hindsight, the opportunity to increase the chance of success for good areas or reduce the expenditures in poor areas was achievable through improved reservoir characterisation or better pilot planning. In some cases, the resource volumes are large, but the progression of resources to reserves has been less certainty based on challenges. In this paper we will highlight some key observations from several Australian CSG pilots that led to success or challenges for each case. The authors' goals are to identify key indicators, which if recognised earlier may have increased the rate of success or reduced unnecessary expenditures in these pilot areas.|","pilot planning, completions, coalbed methane, reservoir characterisation, australia"

Despite the dramatic growth of exploration and appraisal activities for coalbed methane (CBM) wells in the Bowen basin, there is still a lack of understanding on the impacts of geomechanics toward well planning, drilling issues caused by borehole stability, and production performance. From the regional core rock mechanics analysis performed so far, we have observed that coals are generally weak and are prone to failure that can lead to significant consequences in drilling and completion for CBM production wells. The geomechanics issues become prominent, especially for long reach and complex multibranched laterals wells, as rock mechanical properties vary along the coalseam target. Proper characterization of rock mechanical properties, especially the unconfined compressive strength (UCS), is essential in wellbore stability analysis. 
In this paper, we focus on geomechanics laboratory core analysis techniques to characterize UCS, challenges in UCS core testing on coal samples, and a case study which compares results from five different types of UCS testing on coal and siltstone samples: conventional uniaxial compression, pseudo-UCS, single stage triaxial, multi-stage triaxial, and scratch. 
Introduction 
Wellbore stability issues have significant impact in drilling and completing CBM wells in the Bowen basin, especially in long-reach and complex multi-branched lateral wells. Geomechanics evaluation can be performed to mitigate wellbore stability issues by optimizing the mud weight required to keep a stable borehole (Puspitasari et. al., 2014). Done correctly, this type of evaluation has the potential of preventing costly short- and long-term drilling and completion problems. 
Proper characterization of rock mechanical properties is essential in wellbore stability analysis. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) is the most important rock strength parameter to describe stability at the borehole wall (Fjaer et al., 2008).  UCS is defined as the strength of a rock or soil sample when crushed in one direction (uniaxial) without lateral restraint (Allaby & Allaby, 2014). A continuous UCS profile along a wellbore is typically estimated using mathematical and empirical equations that uses well logs (such as sonic, density, and GR log) and/or interpreted petrophysical parameters (such as volume of clay, total porosity, and effective porosity). To ensure that the log-derived UCS is representative of the actual rock strength, the equations must be calibrated with direct measurement from laboratory core tests. 
Laboratory Core Tests to Characterize Rock Strength 
Several types of laboratory test can be performed to characterize rock strength. The tests are typically done on cylindrical samples (core plugs) obtained at the depth of interest. The size of the plug is typically 1.5 in. in diameter and 3 in. long. For small grain-size rock, such as shales, smaller plug sizes can be used. The small shale plug size is ideally 1 in. in diameter and 2 in. long, but it can also be as little as 0.75 in. in diameter and 1.5 in. long. Table 1 compares of some of the most common tests used to measure UCS in the industry. |","UCS, Mechanical Properties, Coal, Core Test"

ADCOs oil and gas concessions onshore Abu Dhabi have several faulted structures including 3-way closure with fault seals within Cretaceous carbonate reservoir sequences. The prolific reservoir units have around 20-25% matrix porosity with tenths of mD permeability. The cap-rock of these reservoir units is mainly composed of a very dense carbonate with less than 5% porosity. 
A Geomechanical study was initiated with exploration objectives: (1) to understand the Geomechanical and geological rock properties variation closer to the fault (2) to evaluate the fault seal assessment for this complex faulted structure including Hydrocarbon Column (HC) height at exploration scale (3) uncertainties and its impact on fault seal assessment and (4) its application to exploration potential of the prospect. This paper discusses the sensitivity of different assumptions, Geomechanical parameters and hydrocarbon column height on structure and fault seal integrity, which influence exploration portfolio. 
A dedicated well was drilled and cored especially at the vicinity of few seismic faults to characterize the rock mechanical and petrological properties. Seismic semblance, core data and image log analyses across the fault have been carried out, together with Rock Mechanics Testing (RMT), which was very challenging due to selection of identical plug samples from similar depths. 1D Geomechanical models, which include in-situ stresses, pore pressure and rock strength and elastic properties for offset wells were built by integrating various data sets from this field. These calibrated 1D Geomechanical models are used to build 3D Geomechanical models and are further used for fault seal assessment. 
Results from core examination and thin section analysis show intense fracturing at the vicinity of the fault zones. Furthermore, there is micro-porosity loss clearly seen in thin sections as a result of cementation and digenesis. The seismic semblance, core data and image log analyses across the fault suggests that there is a significant uncertainty with dip magnitude of faults and this dip may range from 60° to 90°. The strike of these faults varies from N45W to N75W, typical fault orientations in Cretaceous formations of Abu Dhabi. While high porous reservoir rock is experiencing normal-stress setting, very dense cap rock is experiencing strike-slip stress setting. The strain along the fault-seal planes varied substantially depending on their dips and strikes and demonstrated different strengths under both predominant stress settings. 
Introduction 
The exploration portfolio of ADCO (Sirat et al., 2012) involves numerous leads and prospects and 42% of these plays represent three way closures with fault seals as shown in Figure 1. The built-up pressure from the height of the hydrocarbon column (HC), together with the pore-pressure and the in-situ stress magnitude control the integrity of the fault seals capacity. 
Fault slippage and reactivation was first recognized as a possible cause of fluid flow in faulted areas by Sibson (1985) and is fundamentally governed by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Analytical approaches usually simplify the problem to homogeneous and regular shaped reservoirs submitted to constant pore pressure and make use of closed-form solutions that range from simple Mohr-Coulomb failure relationships to provide fundamental solutions of elastic inclusions embedded in a halfspace (Geertsma, 1966, 1973; Segall, 1989, 1992; Zoback, 2007; Soltanzadeh and Hawkes, 2009). Zoback (2007) has extensively investigated this phenomenon in a detailed review. |","exploration, Fault Seal, hydrocarbon column height, geomechanics, carbonate"

H, Kuwait Oil Company| Ahmed, Khalid, Kuwait Oil Company| Al-Khamees, Waleed Khamis, Kuwait Oil Company","|Abstract 
Kuwait has an unconsolidated formation with viscous oil at shallow-depth. Drilling and completion of horizontal well at such shallow depth is quite challenging. Industry practice is to use Slant Rig for shallow wells. Drilling experts preferred solution that would not entail Slant Rig for any future interventions and instead suggested using conventional vertical rig to establish feasibility of drilling and completion as a pilot. 
Lots of pre-drilling studies were carried out which involved Geomechanics Study to understand Stress orientation, pore pressure and sanding risk; Laboratory test of return permeability on core plugs for drilling fluid design and pore-bridging material selection; XRD & SEM analysis for clay mineral identification; Torque and Drag Analysis for predicted performance during drilling and completion and Particle Size Analysis for sand control design with slotted liner. 
Pre-job coordination meetings, Daily briefings, usage of Rotary Steerable System, Geo-Steering and Mid-course correction of trajectory based on Real Time Data Monitoring resulted in well placement in sweet spot. Well by well, rig days got reduced, lateral lengths increased, tangent sections for pump placement optimised and practically no held up occurred during drilling, casing/ liner lowering or completion. This was a World record of drilling horizontal well using vertical rig at such shallow depth. 
The well completion as verified from Silicon Activation log suggests optimal placement of the slotted liner. This is further vindicated from zero sand and water production, another great achievement for the pilot project. Till date 7 such shallow wells have been drilled with 6 on continuous production for over 2 years in different parts of the field. Successful drilling and completion of these shallow-depth horizontal wells by conventional vertical rig in an efficient and cost-effective manner has confirmed all the pre-drilling assumptions and technological tests for the pilot phase, reaching world record breaking achievement. 
Introduction 
Kuwait has a deposition of viscous oil at a very shallow depth. The sand-shale alteration contains viscous oil in 4 different sub-units, separated by shaly/ silty/ calcitic cemented zones. Besides the shaly baffles, there is about 5% smectite-illite clay content in the formation sands- which require clay stabilization during drilling. Vertical wells are usually drilled with 3 to 5% KCl Polymer mud. As viscous oil production rate is much lower compared to that of light oil, any viscous oil development project requires large number of wells. Surface layout gets further complicated due to multiple lines for steam injection and production. Horizontal wells in such a scenario can definitely facilitate reduction in both well count as well as surface congestion. |","conventional vertical rig, shallow-depth horizontal well, torque and drag analysis, drilling and completion, unconsolidated formation"
"27","172876-MS","On Thermodynamics of Undrained Zone in SAGD Process","Irani, Mazda, Suncor Energy Inc.| Ghannadi, Sahar, University of Alberta","|Abstract 
In Part 1 of this study (SPE 165457-MS) a permeability enhancement at the edge of steam chamber where the oil sand has been sheared under thermal stimulation was described and an increase in oil drainage rates was calculated for different conditions. Finally, a modified Butlers Theory that includes geomechanical effects was described. 
Since heat transfer mechanisms are pivotal to the SAGD process and there are some doubts on the behaviour of the undrained zone at the edge of SAGD steam chamber in this study thermodynamics of undrained zone is discussed and new mechano-thermal equations are described. At the edge of steam chamber heat energy is transferred from steam to reservoir, reducing the viscosity of the bitumen, which flows under gravity toward a horizontal production well. Some of the heat transferred into the reservoir is used to increase the temperature of the reservoir, and some is stored as strain energy associated with the thermal stress field. The classical approach to exploring heat transfer studies in the SAGD industry is designed to satisfy only the conservation of energy. Therefore, there is a lack of understanding of strain energy absorbed within the reservoir, and its effect on temperature variation inside the reservoir. The aim of the present work is to introduce a thermodynamic model to explore the effects of strain energy on temperature within the reservoir. This study explores the negative effect of developed stress field on heat transfer normal to the steam chamber interface. The novelty of this approach is the fact that it fully honours the energy equation. This study suggests the strain-energy number ( ) as a new dimensionless number representing an importance of the strain energy effect on the temperature profile within the reservoir. The results obtained from this study reveal that it is suitable to use Butlers theory and to exclude the strain energy effects in heat transfer in the SAGD process. This study uses both thermodynamic approach and pressure front evaluation to argue the current practice of suggesting no permeability enhancement occurrence beyond the 12 m from the steam interface suggested by Li et al. (2004) based on the bitumen viscosity greater than 20,000 cP. This study proposes using one tenth-length of pressure front for drained zone which is beyond the temperature front advancement. Knowing that the shear is mostly induced within temperature front, geomechanical effects within the reservoir can be studied suggesting drained condition.

To ensure that the tunnel elements can be immersed and landed safely, an experimental study with scale model tests was performed to investigate the dynamic responses of the immersing tunnel element under random waves. The experimental measurements revealed quantitatively the dynamic behavior of the tunnel element and hoist ropes under different wave climates and negative buoyancy. From the results, we observed uncontrolled motions of the element and slack in the hoist ropes during the stage of freeboard elimination. Thus, an important conclusion is that the freeboard elimination scenario should be checked against cable breakages and the stability of the tunnel element in the design stage, which has not been highlighted in the past literature. 
Introduction 
The construction of a submerged tunnel is a complex and challenging undertaking. Many engineering design considerations related to the tunnel elements are involved (Ingerslev, 2005; Zhao, 2007), including their subsea connection, waterproofing, transportation and immersion, and protection against earthquakes. These tunnel elements are typically constructed in nearby yards onshore, and then they are towed to the site location. Once a tunnel element arrives on site, it is attached through cables to large floating pontoons at the site location that are moored to the seabed. After the cable connection, the tunnel element is then ballasted, immersed, and sunk in place. The analysis of the motion response of the tunnel element under ambient waves is critical during the immersion process, as the response directly affects the accuracy of placement and subsequent ease of connection among the neighboring tunnel elements.|","Tunnel,  freeboard elimination,  random wave,  dynamic response"

The PP forecasts were based on resistivity- and sonic-based models calibrated with pressure measurements and drilling events, such as kicks from existing wells. FGs were based on leakoff tests and loss events from offset wells and were not necessarily equal to either the minimum compressive principal stress (often considered a lower bound to FG) or the formation-breakdown pressure (often considered an upper bound to FG that includes effects of formation tensile strength and nearwellbore hoop stress). The minimum compressive horizontal stress was calculated from lithology-dependent effective-stress ratios. Maximum horizontal stress was inferred from observed breakouts. PP and stresses were combined with formation properties from well logs and laboratory rock-mechanics tests to provide input for elastoplastic (shales) and poroelastic (sands) boreholestability (BHS) models. These techniques are applicable to exploration, appraisal, or early-development wells that have potential for encountering geopressured formations in high-angle well sections requiring good predrill estimates to adequately plan the casing and drilling programs and determine BHS. The predrill studies can be extended to provide integrated real-time PP and BHS while drilling, and the models can be recalibrated after each well to provide updated predictions for subsequent wells. There are only minor deviations in the predicted PP and FG among the different well locations considered. Common features include potential loss zones in the shallow overburden, pressure ramp within the Jamieson, pressure regression below the Aptian, and near-hydrostatic pressure within the Upper Swan and below. The BHS models indicate that minimum-required mud weight in deviated sections could be up to 20% higher than that required to balance formation PP. In one well that would cross a suspected fault, the risk of fault reopening or reactivation is low.|","Browse basin, fault reactivation, pore pressure, fracture gradient, borehole stability"

We investigate coupled flow and geomechanics in gas production from extremely low-permeability reservoirs such as tight- and shale-gas reservoirs, using dynamic porosity and permeability during numerical simulation. In particular, we take the intrinsic permeability as a step function of the status of material failure, and the permeability is updated every timestep. We consider gas reservoirs with the vertical and horizontal primary fractures, using the single- and dynamic double-porosity (dual-continuum) models. We modify the multiple-porosity constitutive relations for modeling the double porous continua for flow and geomechanics. The numerical results indicate that the production of gas causes redistribution of the effective-stress fields, increasing the effective shear stress and resulting in plasticity. Shear failure occurs not only near the fracture tips but also away from the primary fractures, which indicates generation of secondary fractures. These secondary fractures increase the permeability significantly, and change the flow pattern, which, in turn, causes a change in the distribution of geomechanical variables. From various numerical tests, we find that shear failure is enhanced by a large pressure drop at the production well, a high Biot's coefficient, and low frictional and dilation angles. Smaller spacing between the horizontal wells also contributes to faster secondary fracturing. When the dynamic double-porosity model is used, we observe a faster evolution of the enhanced-permeability areas than that obtained from the single-porosity model, mainly because of a higher permeability of the fractures in the double-porosity model. These complicated physics for stress-sensitive reservoirs cannot properly be captured by the uncoupled or flow-only simulation, and, thus, tightly coupled flow and geomechanical models are highly recommended to describe accurately the reservoir behavior during gas production in tight- and shale-gas reservoirs and to design production scenarios smartly.|","secondary fracturing, shale gas, coupled flow and geomechanics, tight gas, enhanced permeability"

Advancements in directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing have transformed low-quality resources into economically viable sources of energy. Over the past 7 years, exploration and production (E&P) companies have increased production rates, but not necessarily recovery rates, and therein lies the challenge. |Predicting and maximizing estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) is crucial for moving from efficient to effective unconventional shale completion operations. E&P companies are drilling and producing shale reservoirs at an increasing rate, which is contributing significantly to North American oil and natural gas; however, significant reserves are being left behind. |Techniques for predicting EUR vary by operator. Some calculate EUR by extrapolating from initial production rates while others may apply decline curve trends from one play to another. Each method has its advantages and each its caveats. Operators need 6 months to 1 year of production history to truly estimate EUR. However, extrapolation of initial production rates rarely tells the whole story. Some operators may have insufficient data to understand the longer-term behavior, and though traditional decline curve analysis has proven effective for prediction of conventional reservoir production, we are seeking different, more realistic methods to apply to unconventional shale reservoirs. |The variability in unconventional shale plays is leading to unpredictable performance from wells. Therefore, as an industry, we must realize that understanding the composition and behavior of the target geology during fracturing is essential to hit the sweet spots and ultimately will result in maximizing the amount of recoverable reserves. |One of the most important concepts that needs to be fully appreciated is that every well faces a unique set of circumstances. Well and stage spacing is at the forefront of maximizing the production and economics of each completion. We need to evaluate each distinct well to understand the relationship between EUR and well spacing, stage spacing, lateral lengths, and orientation to better optimize completions for each well. Services are needed for the recommendation of fracture treatment designs that maximize treatment efficiency, and a clear demonstration of the effect of completion designs on reservoir recovery. For instance, a technique that could predict initial production and EUR would enable operators to understand the economics of each well earlier to improve booked reserves. |Today, approximately 62% of all wells fractured in the United States are horizontal wells. In an effort to reduce costs, E&P companies are factory mode drilling these wells, which means they are using identical well spacing, orientation, and fracturing techniques for every well. It is a one-size-fits-all approach that may keep costs low by shaving days off of the drilling process, but is failing to adequately deplete the reservoir.|","Document Type

As is typical of deepwater wells, it has a narrow drilling window between pore pressure and fracture gradient, requiring many casing strings to reach total depth (TD). Because pressure-related problems are often extremely costly when drilling conventionally in deep water, initial design assumptions were conservative, assuming the maximum pore pressure and minimum fracture gradient for casing-point and pipe selection. As with all conventional casing designs, the resulting pipe has limited capacity to withstand increased burst and collapse loads associated with extending hole sections if the opportunity arises. Managed-pressure drilling (MPD) enables the development of an adaptive well design by providing three key advantages over conventional drilling: the ability to detect kicks and losses extremely accurately (in gallons, rather than barrels); the ability to rapidly respond to and dynamically control detected kicks and losses by adjusting backpressure on the annulus, keeping kick volumes small; and the ability to perform dynamic pore-pressure and formation-integrity tests. Detecting and responding rapidly to kicks allows for the well to be designed with smaller kick tolerances. Furthermore, by keeping the kicks small, they can be circulated out quickly without requiring conventional, time-consuming well-control operations, which often lead to further hole problems. When this advantage is coupled with dynamic pore-pressure tests and dynamic formation-integrity tests, real-time optimization of casing points can be achieved safely with reduced risk of costly well-control incidents. The method presented here, applicable to any deepwater well, uses low, expected, and high pore-pressure and fracture-gradient estimates to develop an adaptive casing design for the well. In this paper, kick-tolerance calculations for selecting casing points by use of MPD are defined. The effect of reduced kick-tolerance requirements because of the application of MPD is demonstrated, and an adaptive procedure for real-time design optimization of the well is presented. The method results in decision criteria that identify key depths where casing strings can be eliminated without compromising the ability to reach objective TD. The resulting adaptive casing design will most likely eliminate at least one, and has the potential to eliminate two, casing strings, representing significant cost savings.|","adaptive well construction"

Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is one successful thermal-recovery technique applied in Alberta oil-sand reservoirs. When considering in-situ production from bitumen reservoirs, one must reduce viscosity for the bitumen to flow toward the production well. Steam injection is currently the most promising thermal-recovery method. Although steamflooding has proved to be a commercially viable way to extract bitumen from bitumen reservoirs, caprock integrity and the risk of losing steam containment can be challenging operational problems. Because permeability is low in Albertan thermal-project caprock formations, heating greatly increases the pressure on any water trapped in pores as a result of water thermal expansion. This water also sees a great increase in volume as it flashes to steam, causing a large effective-stress reduction. After this condition is established, pore-pressure increases can lead to caprock shear failure or tensile fracturing, and to subsequent caprock-integrity failure or potential casing failure. It is typically believed that low-permeability caprocks impede the transmission of pore pressure from reservoirs, making them more resistant to shear failure (Collins 2005, 2007). In considering the ""thermo-hydromechanical pressurization"" physics, low-permeability caprocks are not always more resistant. As the steam chamber rises into the caprock, the heated pore fluids may flash to steam. Consequently, there is a vapor region between the steam-chamber interface penetrated into the caprock and the water region within the caprock which is still at a subcritical state. This study develops equations for fluid mass and thermal-energy conservation, evaluating the thermo-hydromechanical pressurization in low-permeability caprocks and the flow of steam and water after steam starts to be injected as part of the SAGD process. Calculations are made for both short-term and long-term responses, and evaluated thermal pressurization is compared for caprocks with different stiffness states and with different permeabilities. One can conclude that the stiffer and less permeable the caprock, the greater the thermo-hydromechanical pressurization; and that the application of SAGD can lead to high pore pressure and potentially to caprock shear, and to subsequent steam release to the surface or potential casing failure.|","two-phase (steam/water) flow , thermal pressurization, caprock integrity, SAGD, thermo-hydromechanical pressurization"

Although both full- and partial-flotation methodologies have been used successfully to extend the reach in many field cases, the influence of buoyancy on tubular instability has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an extensive experimental and analytical study, focusing on static tubular instability inside horizontal wellbores with emphasis on buoyancy. In terms of the experimental research, running tubulars into horizontal wellbores was simulated with four different pipes, varying buoyancy, and varying loading speed. Throughout the tests, axial loads both applied to the pipe and transmitted through the pipe were recorded simultaneously, with respect to pipe displacement. Experiments reveal that currently existing models give reasonable approximations as long as buoyancy is not included in the tests. The major interpretation from the experiments is contrary to what currently existing expressions imply (i.e., tubular buckles immediately as effective weight approaches zero; even for naturally buoyant conditions, considerable amount of axial load is still required for both buckling initiation and helix formation). As buoyancy increases further, results and predictions diverge from each other considerably. To eliminate the discrepancies between results and predictions,theoretical study was conducted. Empirical correlations that also consider the influence of buoyancy on critical buckling loads are presented. Finally, another pipe was also tested within different buoyancy conditions to validate the equations developed. Experimental results of this pipe closely match the new analytical findings.

Geomechanical classifications in a schist rock mass, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais were applied in a slope located in Inconfidentes highway, close to urban neighborhood of Ouro Preto. The Rock Mass Rating (RMR), the Rock Mass Quality (Q) and the Rock Mass Index (RMi) were obtained. Two different sectors were identified along the slope. Sector 1 is highly weathered, presenting failures through rock material and a large quantity of rock debris below the slope. Sector 2, which is very close to Sector 1, but much less weathered than it, has presented rock block failures, typical of discontinuous rock masses. Due to high degree of weathering, especially in Sector 1, the geotechnical survey has presented many difficulties. Values of unconfined rock strength in Sector 1, measured by Schmidt Hammer, for instance, were influenced by the degree of weathering, as only less weathered portions could be used for measuring rebound hardness values. RQD values, which are directly related to the discontinuity frequency and spacing, were more representative of the difference between sectors than rock strength. Discontinuity spacing was directly measured in unstable rock blocks, as it shows a strong relationship with rock mass behavior in both sectors. Discontinuity persistence has to be estimated, especially in Sector 1, due to the conditions of the outcrop, covered by failures and vegetation. According to RMi the rock mass in both sectors is classified as moderately strong. However these values are influenced by the unconfined rock strength, measured with Schmidt Hammer, bringing considerable uncertainties to this classification, especially in Sector 1. Estimation of strength and deformability properties of the rock mass using geomechanical classifications were done but some values exhibited important discrepancies, depending on the classification and correlations assumed.|","Geomechanical classification,  soft rocks,  geotechnical survey"

This paper discusses the design of underground salt caverns, opened by solution mining, for the production of brine and storage of natural gas under high pressures. The caverns are located in a salt basin in the northeast region of Brazil. Special attention is given to the geomechanical analysis carried out by computer codes specially developed for the simulation of salt creep behavior under different initial stress states and temperatures. These codes were applied to the design of the underground potash mine in the state of Sergipe, overlying tachyhydrite and carnalite with very high creep strain rates and to the design of the pre-salt oil wells in Santos Basin. The constitutive creep equations implemented in the codes are based on a double mechanism creep law. The creep constants adopted in the simulation are taken from a previous investigation carried out on an experimental panel of the potash mine, considering the stratified geology with different salt rocks of the basin where the mine is located. The excavation of the caverns by solution mining is also simulated starting from a geostatic initial equilibrium state of stresses, imposed through a special formulation implemented in these computer codes.|","mine design,  natural gas storage and brine production,  numerical modeling,  stability analysis, rock salt caverns"

This paper describes a multi-scale approach used to study the Cuiaba Mine in Brazil. In such approach, a three-dimensional mine-scale or global model is used to model the mine behaviour through its entire Life of Mine. Sub-models, with finer meshes sub-models used to target specific areas. The boundaries of the sub-models are controlled by the mine-scale model to ensure compatibility of displacements and stress between the different scales. The results illustrate how such an approach is capable of representing the observed mine behaviour, including falls of ground observed during operation. In addition, it is also discussed how the results of such an approach can be used in mine planning with significant potential savings arising from the avoidance of high stress zones or zones of significant rock damage.|","Life of Mine model,  multi-scale modelling, mining geomechanics,  rock damage,  Abaqus/FEA"

Traditionally, formation damage has been associated with the presence of a flow reduction around the wellbore area due to drilling and completion operations; however factors such as variation in pore pressure can induce a response in the geomechanical behavior of the reservoir and thermodynamic behavior of fluid, which causes additional decrements on the flow capacity of the well drainage area. A procedure has been developed that determines the damage caused by changes in permeability due to variations in pressure. The procedure requires two parameters: the permeability modulus and the damaged caused by drilling and completion operations; these parameters are obtained using a coupled fluid-geomechanical simulator, the Numerical Transient Simulator (NTS), by the interpretation of a well transient analysis. The NTS was developed by the Applied Geomechanics Research Group (GIGA) of the Petroleum Engineering Program at the National University of Colombia  MedellIn Campus. With the use of the NTS software it is possible to interpret a well test in a non-conventional way and then decompose the total skin into two components, one of them is the damage due to drilling and completion operations, and the other one is due to changes of permeability caused by pressure variations. The later component can be additionally decomposed into the geomechanical damage and thermodynamic damage as well. By disaggregating the formation damage, it is possible to know the factor that is having a major impact on the flow reduction. Therefore, the methodology presented in this paper can be used for the selection of the most appropriate well-stimulation procedure. This paper presents the theory and results of the application of this procedure for studying the damage in several wells of a field at the Colombian eastern foothill.|","reservoir geomechanics,  behavior of natural fracture system, Skin by permeability changes"

In Petroleum, Civil and Mining Engineering, designing structures dealing with rock mass is a day-to-day activity. In order to execute such projects, it is essential to know the strength and deformability of rocks, as well as their in situ stress state. In Petroleum Engineering, especially, obtaining rock samples from a well and carrying out lab mechanical tests is costly and time-consuming. Thus, Petroleum Engineers have been attempting to determine rock mechanical properties through index tests or log-based correlations as to expedite this process and reduce the global cost of the activity. I order to be confident about results obtained via index tests or correlations, though, it is necessary to carry out a calibration of such outcomes against results from standard mechanical tests. In this article, a procedure used to determine the unconfined compressive strength is proposed. The data from that process supports the planning of two pilot projects to be developed by Petrobras in an on-shore oil field. In order to estimate the UCS for this oil field, three methods were applied: the standard uniaxial test, the scratch test and a log-based correlation. Due to the excellent agreement among results of all three methods, it was possible to extrapolate the data regarding UCS for the entire interval to be analyzed. The set of logs available, mainly transit-time and density log, was used as a guide in the UCS extrapolation process.|","scratch test,  rock mechanics,  uniaxial compressive test, Strength and elastic property of rock,  empirical correlation for UCS,  mechanical lab test"

Permeability is an intrinsic property of porous materials, dependent of pore size and interconnection in microscopic level, as well as fissure width and orientation in macroscopic level. Mechanical loading of such a porous material leads to changes in the geometry of the pore space with impacts on the macroscopic measured permeability. Realistic reservoir simulation models should consider these permeability changes as these may affect the reservoir pressure distribution, saturation front shapes and also the drilling mudwindow of infill drilling wells. However, the petroleum industry still lack of reliable and comprehensive permeability variation models and parameters. The article presents results of a campaign of hydrostatic tests underwent on samples from limestone and dolomite outcrops. The main target of those tests is the strain-dependent permeability measurement and the validation of the model proposed by Petunin et al. (2011). This model is an extension to the Carman-Kozeny formulation and, although still simplistic by considering pore volume changes alone as the main driver for the permeability variations, it may be quite effortlessly introduced in the conventional numerical reservoir simulators as Carman-Kozeny exponents or even as cell permeability multipliers. The results presented here are the first step of an internal project which aims to determine the correlation between variation in permeability caused by variation of in situ stress and strain state due to reservoir depletion for limestone and dolomite oil reservoirs. The chosen commercial Silurian Dolomite and Indiana Limestone outcrops can be considered as quasi-homogeneous standard materials when compared to real reservoir samples, a key aspect for this testing methodology validation.|","Carman-Kozeny,  strain-dependent permeability, Rock mechanics,  reservoir simulation,  geomechanics,  permeability multipliers"

Deep well disposal of slurried drilling waste using a modified CRI process has been implemented at the Saudi Aramco Manifa Oilfield. Injection of drilling waste into a deep, high porosity, high permeability sandstone (approximately 6500 ft TVD) at Manifa began in 2012, and has continued with up to eleven disposal wells being active during drilling operations. To-date (April 2014), over 238,380 bbls of drilling waste streams have been injected. The modified CRI operations utilize a cyclic slurry fracture injection process at high rates with direct-sand injection via dedicated disposal wells. Extensive process monitoring/analyses is used during CRI operations to ensure process control. The waste streams include drill cuttings, oil based drilling fluids, water based drilling fluids and brine. Deep well disposal provides a secure operation achieving zero discharge by injecting cuttings and associated fluids. Skip and ship is used as secondary waste management method in case of limitations in CRI operations. The Khafji disposal formation was chosen for slurry waste injection at Manifa field since it met or exceeded the desired criteria for permeability, porosity, depth and other properties. Injection takes place on drilling rigs and into dedicated disposal wells. Hydraulic fracturing is necessary to inject the slurry containing drilling wastes. As injection goes on, slurry design, injection strategy and dynamic formation geomechanics/fluid flow response will affect to the performance of the disposal formation. The use of modified CRI operations, using a cyclic, high rate slurry fracture injection process, is essential to ensure process control, maximize the formation storage capacity for these disposal wells/formations; and to ensure that the zero discharge operational-drilling objectives of the Manifa Drilling Team are met. This paper will present a field case assessment of the Manifa CRI operations performance in terms of achieving process control and meeting the zero discharge operational-drilling objectives of the Manifa Drilling Team by ensuring successful, reliable deep well disposal operations.|","Deep Well Disposal,  Process Control, Cuttings Re-injection,  Zero Discharge"

Rock cuttings injection into subsurface is often considered as alternative for disposal of drilling waste, as it is both economical and environmental friendly. The repeated cuttings injection leads to the generation of secondary fractures after initial hydraulic fracturing. In this article, the Particle Flow Code (PFC) is used for a microscopic numerical system to simulate the interaction between the natural fractures, hydraulic fractures, and the fractures developed by re-injection of rock cuttings, due to the fact that PFC captures the dynamic mechanism of cuttings re-injection into fractured formation. In the model, a synthetic rock mass (SRM) with random distributed natural fractures is created, coupling with hydraulic fracturing, and apply drilling cuttings re-injection. Considerations on the influence of rock cuttings physical properties, injection pressure, and the stress regimes of SRM have been derived in this paper. The results demonstrate that the higher injection pressure helps generation of shear cracking; the fluid viscosity has not significant effect after propagation of fractures; taking advantages of natural fractures into stimulation treatment offers benefits to optimal conductivity with hydraulic fracturing.|","Re-fracturing,  Stochastic Microcracks, PFC"

Rock cutting mechanics has been studied in order to better understand drilling process at the cutter scale. The cutting energy is mainly dependent on cutter orientation and rock properties. Although there have been some analytical solution for the 2D cutting process, the siderake effects are not taken into account. This paper proposes an analytical solution for the rock cutting with sharp cutters, considering both backrake and siderake. To validate the model solution, homemade equipment was developed. Based on the cutting action of clays, the experiment was run with no backrake and siderakes varying between 300 and 600. The results agree with the solution proposed for the model. Focusing on a parametric study for two hypothetical rocks, the model has shown that high backrake and/or siderake angles increase the specific energy. The backrake effect is strongly dependent on the rock internal friction angle.|","Siderake, Rock cutting,  Analytical solution Backrake"

In this context, this report aims to expose to the scientific community the necessity of turning evaluations about soft rocks back to the scene, well treated in the eighties and nineties in Brazil. Nowadays, geologists and civil engineers from technical and scientific acquaintances, have not given substantial importance to this subject, as discussed in several occasions before. It is currently advisable to incorporate this theme in the agenda, since the substantial demand for infrastructure, such as the High Speed Train between the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Campinas, new airports expansions and constructions, highways and railways development, slopes stability in urban areas, etc. All these are indispensable to hold future (and actual) demands taking into account a regular sequence. Being in the interface between soil and rock masses, summing the relationship between two different points of view, qualitatively and quantitatively, the understanding of what a soft rock means ends up generating a diversity of classifications and interpretations, without actually bringing trustful parameters to support safe engineering projects.

Most of the problems caused during drilling wells, such as pipe sticking, poor wellbore cleaning, sidetracks and even wellbore lost, are generated by some phenomena manifested in wellbore wall, such as Break-out, Wash-out y Kea-seat, which give origin to some slides of the wellbore wall known as cavings, the above problems and their effects contributes to increase the non productive time.
Currently, the caving volumes are used as a warning signal of wellbore instabilities during real time monitoring, since according to its morphological classification and produced volume represent kind of wellbore damage and its critical nature respectively. Considering the above aspects, the main aim of this research is to propose a new approach to estimate cavings volumes, in order to identify the kind of wellbore failure and the corrective actions in real time. Besides it can simulate the most critical aspect of the problem predicting the cavings volumes and the depth which they come from in order to prevent and mitigate them, thus reducing the non productive time during wellbore drilling.
In this new approach, a simulation of drilled wellbore is carried out using the Finite Elements Method taking into account the failure criterion and the material constitutive model to each cell of the simulation mesh, these considering the rock mechanical properties, mud weight and in situ stress state, in order to quantify the cells volume that failed in the simulation and reproduce the cavings volume of wellbore wall that would be produced during drilling.
An analytical approach is proposed in order to validate the results of the simulation. It consists approximating the cavings volume to the volume of a triangular prism, and calculating it by using geomechanics parameters such as in situ stresses, break-out angle and its width, mud weight and pore pressure. All these geomechanics parameters were obtained from wellbore logs.|","velocity, Anisotropy,  anisotropic structure,  modulus,  stress,  permeability"

This paper deals with the drilling of rocks by fixed polycrystalline diamond cutters. Single-cutter experiments were carried out on evaporites and results are presented in terms of forces acting upon the cutter and mechanical specific energy spent during cutting action.

The effects of depth of cut, cutter friction and geometry on drilling efficiency were studied. Drilling efficiency increases with DOC up to a certain level where it stabilizes. The decrease of drilling efficiency with increase of cutter friction and use of blunt cutters also indicates that the methodology is satisfactorily robust and accurate.|","single cutter experiment,  evaporites, Drilling,  discrete element method"

The task consisted of performing geomechanical studies in order to revise the sizing of the chambers and pillars in a pilot area chosen within the Urucum mine. This was done in order to execute experimental mining for the recovery of pillars; automated monitoring technology was also utilized.

The sedimentary rocks cover about 70% of the Brazilian territory. Large sedimentary basins, from the Paleozoic to the early Cenozoic, present a wide variability of lithology, raging from coarse grained rocks as the conglomerates, to the fine grained siltstones and claystones. Geotechnical parameters (index properties, resistance to uniaxial and triaxial compression strength, deformability, disaggregation, slaking, drillability, erosion resistance, etc.) have been determined for the several rocks types, concerning various projects like roads, channels, dams, tunnels, etc. The tropical weathering has been considered a factor of great importance in the evolution of these rocks, due to the decrease of their resistance and deformability in some cases, and the lateritization and cementation, in others. This paper briefs information regarding the geotechnical properties of several sedimentary rocks in Brazil, as well as gives some guidelines to foresee their characterization related to strength, weathering and slaking.

Drilling and the development of oil and gas production in carbonate reservoirs have presented serious operational problems in the Brazilian Offshore oil fields. These problems are partly caused by difficulties in the characterization of carbonates whose structures have complex spatial distributions. This paper proposes to integrate the processing and analysis of digital images acquired from X-ray micro-CTs and the development of finite element meshes for numerical simulation in order to predict elastic properties and correlates this with the rock microstructure. Digital images of samples of outcrops (travertine) were used, considered as analogous to carbonate rock reservoirs. The results were compared to the actual test results and data found in the literature indicating the potential and current limitations of this technique. It is concluded that the value of Youngs modulus obtained from numerically simulated tests is affected by the spatial distribution of the pores and the microporosity of the rock. The values found in the virtual test tended to be higher than those obtained in actual tests. This difference is due to the difficulty of inserting, in the microstructure numerical model, the contacts between the grains, as well as more compressible regions not determined by the acquisition of the images. It is concluded that this technique has the potential to assist the analysis of relevant aspects of the microstructure of elastic properties of carbonate rocks.|","Microstructure,  elastic properties of rocks,  X-ray microtomography"

The present work presents the implementations of a process developed to evaluate the geomechanical effects in petroleum reservoirs and their adjacent rocks. This process can be divided in four parts: (i) workflow for performing the analyses including the pre-processing (mesh generation of a finite element model and the assembly of the input file for the finite element analysis, to run the coupling program), and the post-processing (visualization of the results from reservoir simulation and stress analysis), (ii) a partial coupling scheme, (iii) a partial coupling program, and (iv) a finite element program on GPU. Part (i) of the process was implemented in Gocad (Geological Object Computer Aided Design) program as a plug-in to make sure the geological aspects of the field can be honored in the finite element model. In Part (iv) a finite element program on GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), called Chronos, was implemented in order to reduce the simulation time.

Well design and drilling strategy planning are critical steps during exploration and development of oil and gas fields, but the workflow for well design usually follows a simplified methodology that generally focuses on only one or on a few correlation wells. 3D models are only available for, and focused on, reservoir volume prediction and fluid flow simulation. Lately, it is possible to see some efforts to enhance the full comprehension of the whole field and to develop a more robust well design by using 3D characterization techniques. This paper shows the steps involved in the development of a 3D geological-geomechanical model and how these models can be used as a robust tool to support decision makers. The methodology consists of preparing a geological model which comprises both overburden and reservoir zones, studying and distributing representative geomechanical facies, distributing properties/data of interest, applying correlations between initial data and rock mechanics properties, and calculating in situ stresses. Results of a case study show that an integrated analysis between geologists and geomechanical engineers is instrumental for an efficient 3D geomechanical characterization. Some direct benefits of these models are a global view of field behavior and integrated data, facilitating communication between expert teams, anticipating and preparing for possible drilling hazards and instantly extracting data for each desired well path, and increasing the reliability of well design.|","stability analysis, 3D geological-geomechanical modeling,  well design"

The conversion of a highly impermeable medium like shale into numerous gas producing pay zones, using geomechanics steered, stress-and-structure oriented hydraulic fracturing, is a remarkable achievement. So remarkable in fact that shear mobilization of natural fractures has also to be invoked to explain both the continued though declining production and the sources of larger radius microseismic activity well beyond the assumed ellipsoidally-shaped tensile-fractured and sand-propped central zones. The microseismic activity is believed to be the remote-sensing sign of shearing initiation of a large number of the natural fractures. The assumed shearing, and the resulting gas drainage, cannot occur in the case of gas-shales unless the shale is of high enough modulus to sustain the shear induced dilation, which results in a coupling with enhanced fracture permeability. The pre-peak mobilization of roughness and permeability due to pre-peak dilation, combined with low in situ shear stiffness due to block-size related scale effects, is part of the rock mechanics reality behind critically stressed fractures, which are simplified as linear Mohr Coulomb events in petroleum geomechanics. In reality a more sophisticated and more favourable series of coupled processes are likely to be involved.|","fracture shearing,  coupling,  permeability,  dilation, hydraulic fracturing"

Important research has been developed in recent decades with the objective of the elastic characterization of shale formations, for their usefulness to optimize designs of hydraulic fracturing, seismic exploration, and estimates of horizontal stress and decreased wellbore stability problems. However, the investigation of shale is hampered by its mechanical and chemical instability, hindering the recovery of cores (cm scale) used in conventional mechanical testing. Thus, the development and implementation of experimental correlations to obtain the elastic modulus or Youngs modulus by indentation technique, exhibits a great potential for the elastic characterization of these formations. Currently there is an important advance in the technique of indentation allowing the use of small samples as drill cuttings obtained during drilling and forces significantly lower than required in laboratory tests such as the uniaxial test. The correlations obtained between dynamic Youngs modulus and the results of the indentation test are presented in this article. For this end, cylindrical samples of shale were considered that had both ultrasonic measurements (centimeter scale deformations) for obtaining dynamic Youngs modulus and force-displacements curves obtained with the indentation technique, which allow detection of displacements as small as 0.001 mm.|","Youngs modulus,  indentation test,  experimental correlations"

The rock materials are used in construction with diversity in their applications. Before they are extracted from mines or quarries, it presents in a balanced alteration state with the environment, which was achieved in a geological interval of time. From the moment of extraction to the application, the environment is changed, then the rock begins to undergo changes until it reaches a new equilibrium. The rate of change in his new environment depends on the susceptibility of the rock to alteration. Thus, the alterability will depend on the qualities of material from the external environment and the exposure time. A rock can change in a time interval which may vary from thousands of years to a few months depending on the characteristics of alterability. This paper aims a critical analysis of laboratory testing procedures to define the properties of rock materials. The test procedures that exist stands out the study of the durability which is an important subject of research and permits to analyze the variation of the long term behavior of the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the materials exposed to degradation agents. The way in which agents act on the materials can mobilize different degradation mechanisms. The main degradation mechanisms of physical and chemical in rock materials stand out to abrasion, disaggregated by crystal growth, the expansion due to thermal effects, fracturing for stress relief, hydrolysis and oxidation. The knowledge about the rock and its main characteristics will define the main laboratory testing procedures that better define the behavior of this material in the subject field degradation.

Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS) is a single well technology for extracting heavy oil where sand flow is used as an enhancing way of the oil well productivity. CHOPS is a massive sand production strategy that responds to foamy oil behavior and wormhole formation, both consequences of geomechanical aspects such as elastoplastic behavior, in-situ stress state redistribution and sand liquefaction that generate a complex multiphase fluid flow (oil, gas, water and sand). Sand grains are removed from solid matrix due high pressure drawdown, but if this is great enough to destroy the internal binding forces of sand particles, sand tends to produce together with oil, thus forming wormholes. Wormhole is a space or cavity in the formation that continually increases in size and creates regions of enhanced permeability and porosity which contribute to higher oil productivity. CHOPS is an attractive and profitable alternative to the exploitation of heavy oil reservoirs around the world, especially in Latin America. Understanding geomechanical aspects such as elastoplastic behavior, stresses redistribution and sand liquefaction is relevant to model sand production during cold heavy oil production. Modeling will also help to analyze how to increase the recovery factor under geomechanical stability conditions and to reduce operational costs of heavy oil reservoirs production by this technology.|","Sand production,  stress distribution,  geomechanical aspects,  sand liquefaction,  CHOPS"

The study also includes a comparative analysis between the results obtained in the research and the proposals made for the characterization of bimrocks and rock masses in general.

Several wells in the Campamento 1 Field were drilled to target the deeper granitoid basement formations of the Neuquen basin. These wells were evaluated using anisotropic stress modeling to estimate the stress profile and identify suitable intervals to fracture. The effects of lateral tectonic strains are considered in the estimation of the horizontal stress profile, using a vertical borehole acoustic log for stiffness and compliance tensor characterization. The objective of this paper is to show the use of hydraulically induced fracture pressures to calibrate the magnitude of the horizontal stresses in a vertical well. The results show how fracture pressures can help in constraining the magnitude of the lateral tectonic strains. Examples of three wells in the Campamento 1 Field are shown where minifrac data were obtained. A non-constant, depth-dependent tectonic lateral strain model, calibrated with the minifrac data was applied in these wells. This calibration methodology is recommended in formations showing significant anisotropy, as elastic anisotropy in tight formation are important in wellbore completion.|","Horizontal principal stress,  In-situ stress,  Lateral tectonic strain,  Anisotropy"

The toppling failure mode is a mechanical process in rock slopes with regularly spaced layers or foliation, which involves block overturning and bending of columnar structures. As those processes develop, the failing of internal structures in the slope may occur, leading the whole system to its collapse. The Discrete Element Method based on circular discrete elements was used to analyze two modes of toppling: the block and flexure toppling modes. The method of the study was structured by means of a progressive modelling of the phenomena, and the subsequent validation of the results through a comparison with analytical and semi-analytical approaches. The strain and strength of rock structures subjected to bending process were modeled using a new contact model between every discrete element, which resulted in a better response than other conventional contact models. Subsequently, in the numerical simulation of a physical model, the strains and strength behavior of the experimental slope are reproduced by the numerical calibration of the rock and the joint mechanical properties. The result of this process shows a significant dependence on the stiffness and frictional joint components rather than the properties of the rock itself. That was a different but an acceptable conclusion among other similar works, which aim the rock properties and the joint frictional angle the main factors that control the slope stability in toppling process.|","rock slope stability,  block toppling, Flexural toppling,  joint stiffness,  discrete element method"

For underground reservoirs, the decrease of pore pressure during hydrocarbon production can trigger reservoir compaction and subsidence problems. In order to analyse and forecast those phenomena, the finite element method (FEM) has been employed in several applications because of its flexibility in the treatment of geometry and topological heterogeneity. Those FEM features can provide more realistic estimates in real fields. However, a linear elastic model is usually adopted to simulate the behaviour of rock materials, disregarding different deformation mechanisms. This paper takes into consideration that issue through the analysis of a real field adopting the linear-elastic and the elasto-plastic Mohr-Coulomb and Modified Cam-Clay models.

A procedure has been developed that determines the damage caused by changes in permeability due to variations in pressure. The procedure requires two parameters: the permeability modulus and the damaged caused by drilling and completion operations; these parameters are obtained using a coupled fluid-geomechanical simulator, the Numerical Transient Simulator (NTS), by the interpretation of a well transient analysis. The NTS was developed by the Applied Geomechanics Research Group (GIGA) of the Petroleum Engineering Program at the National University of Colombia  Medellin Campus. With the use of the NTS software it is possible to interpret a well test in a non-conventional way and then decompose the total skin into two components, one of them is the damage due to drilling and completion operations, and the other one is due to changes of permeability caused by pressure variations. The later component can be additionally decomposed into the geomechanical damage and thermodynamic damage as well. By disaggregating the formation damage, it is possible to know the factor that is having a major impact on the flow reduction. Therefore, the methodology presented in this paper can be used for the selection of the most appropriate well-stimulation procedure.

The Numerical Transient Simulator (NTS) is a coupled single-well simulator developed by the Applied Geomechanics Research Group (GIGA) of the Petroleum Engineering Program at the National University of Colombia, MedellIn Campus. The mathematical model is based on single and multiphase flow equation, fully coupled to the stress-deformation equations. The governing equations are discretized in cylindrical coordinates using a second order-finite differences method on a three-dimensional computational grid, composed of an internal domain where flow and rock deformation take place and an external domain, where only deformation can occur. Because in the near-well region stiff pressure, flow and displacements gradients take place, we impose that the nodes separation follows a logarithmic distribution in radial direction. The discretized equations are solved following the IMPES method. The NTS allows the interpretation of a well test by matching pressure and finding permeability modulus and mechanical damage (damage due to drilling and completion operations). In addition, the simulator can evaluate the well production behavior when geomechanical effects exist. The most relevant simulation results provided by the NTS are: pressure distribution, displacement, deformation and stress state, as well as petrophysical and fluid properties distributions throughout the reservoir.

A numerical approach to cave assessment has been developed by Itasca over the past 15 years through the industry-funded International Caving Study (ICS I & II) and Mass Mining Technology (MMT) projects. The procedure has been implemented successfully in the calibration and simulation of cave responses at a number of existing and planned caving projects. In this paper, the procedure is used to simulate block caving for an ongoing underground mining operation, which has been active for more than 40 years. Due to limitations in accessing available information, the problem was posed to reproduce caving and cratering for the last 10 years, starting with the presence of a known cave representing mining in previous years. The algorithm to simulate caving has been implemented within the three-dimensional, continuum based program, FLAC3D, following a rigorous mass-balance routine to ensure that the design production schedule is represented accurately. A constitutive model specially designed to represent caving behavior has been recently developed by Itasca applying the concept of strain-softening (CaveHoek constitutive model), whereby strain-dependent properties are adjusted to represent the effects of dilation and bulking that accompany caving. The main outcome of the study is to compare the simulated cratering at the surface against the known topography at the end of the simulation period. The validation of the field observations provides increased confidence about the model predictions for future mining operations.|","strain softening,  cratering, caving"

Formation collapse in reservoirs where the pressure has not been maintained during depletion can cause permeability reduction, completion damage and well failure, interrupting production and affecting the ultimate recovery from the reservoir. The problem is particularly acute within severely depleted areas of the field. 
In this paper a carbonate gas field was investigated. For this developed field, a further production plan has been scheduled to deplete the reservoir up to the year 2063 without any reservoir pressure maintenance. The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of formation collapse of the productive zone, well failure and completion integrity damage particularly within the severely depleted areas. Coupled reservoir geomechanical modelling was conducted, and different scenarios were investigated to understand the impact of uncertainty in mechanical properties and the presence of faults and fractures. 
The results indicate that pore collapse is likely to be the main failure mechanism of high porosity formations with high levels of depletion. Onset of formation failure is likely to happen around 2018 to 2020, and it is recommended to monitor the production rate of those wells located in high porosity and high depletion areas. Pressure maintenance should be implemented if the reservoir pressure falls below 1000 psi in the later stages of production.

Introduction 
A giant onshore Abu Dhabi carbonate gas field in the United Arab Emirates was investigated. The total area of the field is approximately 1200 km2, but the area of investigation covers approximately 644 km2. It is located approximately 85 kilometers SW of the city of Abu Dhabi. The reservoir thickness of this investigated field is around 90 ft., and the depth of the reservoir top is at about 8500 ft. The reservoir was discovered in 1958 and came on stream in 1963. As shown in Fig. 1, a production plan has been scheduled to further deplete the reservoir from about 2000 psi today, to 600 psi by 2063. In this plan, no pressure maintenance is scheduled. Lack of pressure maintenance could result in formation collapse, which would adversely affect the production and ultimate recovery of this reservoir. 
In this study, the construction of 1D mechanical earth models (MEMs) at ten existing wells was carried out for the gas field. On the basis of seismic interpreted horizons and faults, a 3D MEM was constructed. Then, a coupled reservoir geomechanical modelling approach was used to analyze the risk of the reservoir formation collapse, identifying where, when and at what pressure the collapse would occur. To capture a representative in situ condition, a pre-production initial stress state was simulated and calibrated with measurements and observations in the 1D MEMs. To model the geomechanical behaviour in the reservoir from pre-production to present day, and then to the year 2063, a coupling between reservoir simulation and geomechanical modeling was performed, where the impact of the gas field depletion on reservoir deformation can be assessed with production time. To understand the impact of the mechanical property uncertainty and fault/fracture presence, four scenarios were performed, including a base case (Case 1), a case with weak faults (Case 2), a case with weak faults and formation (Case 3), and a case with weak faults and formation with fractures (Case 4).|","Coupled geomechanical modeling, Abu Dhabi, Depleted gas reservoir, Formation collapse, Reservoir management"

Geological sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in underground formations is the most promising way to decrease the greenhouse emissions into atmosphere. The understanding of long term effects of CO2 storage in carbonate aquifers is challenged by many uncertainties including geochemical effects of CO2 on carbonates and the coupled chemicalmechanical effects. The carbon dioxide dissolves in water forming bicarbonate which will dissociate to carbonic acid. This acid dissolves calcites in carbonate rocks. As a result, the mechanical properties of the aquifer changes through this interaction. It is therefore necessary to study the effect of carbon dioxide sequestration on the integrity of a given formation to get safe and effective long-term storage of CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers. To the best of our knowledge, previous works on CO2 sequestration have focused on the impact of CO2 injection on the petrophysical and mechanical properties of formation rocks but the injection occurred in a short period, which was not enough for carbon dioxide to react with formation brine and thus the chemical reaction that will impact the properties of the rocks. 
The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of CO2 storage on the mechanical properties of carbonate aquifer rocks that were exposed to soaking with CO2. Furthermore, the effect of the duration of CO2-brine contact time or solubility time on these properties was investigated. CO2 was stored in the cores at 2000 psi and 100<U+00BA>C for different time periods ranging from two weeks to three months. The cores were then analyzed for the mechanical properties using acoustics, unconfined compression, and indirect tensile strength testing machines. 
Results showed that storing CO2 for longer times changed the rock mechanical properties significantly. Samples in which CO2 was stored for longer times exhibited greater change in mechanical properties compared to those in which CO2 was stored for shorter time.  The geochemical interaction between CO2, brine, and rock is time dependent making changes in rock mechanical properties also time dependent. 
Introduction 
The emissions of carbon dioxide have become the main contributing factors of a continuing increase in the temperature of the earth leading to global warming. Currently, the techniques of decreasing these emissions have been established including the capture and geological storage of carbon dioxide. There are four areas that are relevant to the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide: 
Enhanced oil recovery (EOR),  |Storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs,  |Storage in deep saline aquifers, and |Enhanced coal bed methane recovery (ECBMR) (Nguyen et al., 2003; Jaeger, 2005). 
Among these areas, the storage of carbon dioxide into deep saline aquifers is considered to be the most effective and advanced technology for reducing the emission CO2 when compared to other sequestration technologies.|","Mechanical Properties, Carbonate Rocks, CO2 Sequestration"

Almost all previous cutter force models assumed that cutting force was proportional to cutting area. Cutting-area-based single cutter force models have been extensively used in polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit design optimization. This paper explains why cutting-area-based bit models failed to predict bit forces. A new cutter force model and a new bit model have been developed and are discussed in the paper. In the new cutter force model, cutting force is a function of the shape of the cutting area. Three types of cutting shapes are respectively modeled. In the new bit model, three-dimensional (3D) rock chips created in front of cutting face are modeled, meshed, and removed from the hole bottom by updating the hole bottom at each time step. To validate the new model, six different PDC bits were designed, manufactured, lab tested under controlled conditions, and field tested. Details from laboratory testing and field-test results are presented. 
Introduction 
Designing a PDC bit with higher drilling efficiency and longer bit life is almost always the objective during PDC bit design optimization. Mathematically speaking, bit design optimization refers designing a PDC bit with the highest drilling efficiency and longest drilling life for given formation properties. This is achieved by varying a set of design variables under a set of predefined constraints. As shown in Fig. 1, the constraints can include bit stability, steerability, and bit hydraulic requirements. It should be noted that some of the constraints could become design objectives in some cases. For example, bit steerability could be more important than bit drilling efficiency during the operation of building a curve in directional drilling. This paper, however, focuses only on drilling efficiency. |","Model, Rock-Chips, PDC, Optimization, Design"

Globally, with a rapidly growing world population, increasing prosperity and improved access to reliable electricity the IEA expects the demand for energy on the planet to increase significantly in the next decades. Meeting this demand globally and in Jordan will be a formidable challenge and requires exploring for conventional hydrocarbons as well as tight / shale oil and gas resources. Jordan has one of the largest oil shale resources in the world and although previous attempts to harness this energy source have been made in Jordan, none have resulted in large scale production of energy from oil shale. In May 2009, Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) signed an Oil Shale Concession Agreement to explore and evaluate the commercial potential of the deeper layers of Jordanian oil shale. Since then, the Jordan Oil Shale Company (JOSCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell, has gathered seismic data over an area of 22,270 km2 across the country and drilled/tested over 300 wells. JOSCO also established one of the most advanced geochemical and geological laboratories in the Middle East to analyze thousands of rock samples, and currently employs more than 200 people of which more than 95% are Jordanian. Being part of Shell provides JOSCO with access to a network of experts world-wide, providing invaluable technical know-how, operational expertise, cutting-edge research capabilities and global commercial insight. Shells approach to oil shale development utilizes a technology called In-situ Conversion Process (ICP). This is different from conventional surface retorting methods and direct firing of oil shale for power generation, and is aimed at heating the oil shale by thermal conduction using a closely spaced array of horizontal heaters. JOSCOs current activities are focused on demonstrating the technical feasibility of ICP technology in Jordan. The first ICP field test (Jordan Field Experiment, JFE) has been designed and will aim to validate JOSCOs subsurface understanding of the ICP process. After the JFE, further piloting is required in Jordan before a commercial project is envisioned. When successful, oil shale can play an important role in supporting the Jordans energy mix, and may also help encourage further benefits to Jordans energy industry, economy and society in the future. 
Introduction 
According to the IEAs World Energy Outlooki, the worlds demand for oil and gas will grow in absolute terms through at least 2035, despite the projected rapid growth of renewables.  Meanwhile, the replacement barrel will likely continue to become ever more challenging to find and produce.  To keep pace, the oil and gas industry is exploring for conventional supplies in increasingly hostile environments and is extending its development of tight / shale oil and gas supplies to more challenging resources. 
One of these resources is oil shale. Oil shale is the informal term used to describe the fine-textured rock of sedimentary origin containing appreciable amounts of indigenous organic matter (kerogen) that yields liquid oil, gas, and water when heated to conversion temperatures.  Oil Shale is occasionally confused with Light Tight Oil, a resource that has recently begun large scale development, primarily in North America (Eagle Ford, Bakken, etc.).  The primary difference is that oil shale is a solid rock and the light tight oil exists as a liquid locked inside a low permeability matrix.|","Shale oil"

In order to optimize the development plans of complex, and unconventional, oil and gas reservoirs it is essential to achieve reliable 3D geomechanical models. These models need to comprise the description of the subsurface geology (e.g. lithologies and petro-elastic properties) and simultaneously the in-situ stress fields affecting the reservoir. Currently, the available geomechanical models are often too simplistic and built based exclusively on sparse well-log data. Therefore, they do not translate properly the complexities and heterogeneities of the subsurface geology for the entire reservoir area. We present herein a novel approach to model seismic-driven 3D geomechanical models based on geostatistical seismic AVO inversion. This novel iterative geostatistical inversion methodology allows retrieving density, P-wave and S-wave velocity models from where dynamic moduli properties can be calculated. The resulting models are then used to derive horizontal and vertical stress field models. It is important to highlight that the resulting seismic-driven 3D geomechanical models are simultaneously conditioned locally at the well locations by previously modeled 1D geomechanical models and by the available seismic reflection data for the rest of the reservoir area. The proposed workflow has been successfully tested on synthetic and real pre-stack seismic data. The synthetic example shows that the resulting high resolution inverse elastic models, as well as the dynamic moduli properties, match the real ones. The inverted petro-elastic models derived from the real pre-stack seismic data allowed a better characterization and management of the reservoir in study. 
Introduction 
Complex and non-conventional oil and gas reservoirs need a detailed, and reliable, description of the reservoirs internal properties in order to better decrease its risk and increase their productivity. Three-dimensional geomechanical models are reliable tools for the characterization of these kinds of reservoirs but are often too simple when compared to the real complex subsurface geology. A geomechanical model the reservoir should include a reliable description of the subsurface geological properties (e.g. lithologies and petro-elastic properties) and simultaneously the in-situ stress fields affecting the reservoir. Often, these 3D geomechanical models are computed recurring exclusively to 1D geomechanical models calibrated at the well locations which are then extrapoled for the entire study area, by for example kriging (Doyen, 2007). Consequently, the resulting models do not represent the complexities and heterogeneities of the subsurface geology for distances far from the well locations (Sengupta et al., 2011) increase the incertainty of the modeled properties at these locations.  
In order to increase the spatial resolution of 3D geomechanical models we need to include, for example, seismic reflection data as part of the modeling process. By building seismic-driven geomechanical models we are able to better constrain the resulting three-dimensional geomechanical models at distances far from the well locations. By integrating geophysical data within the modeling procedure, we reduce the uncertainty related with the modeled properties, e.g. regional horizontal and vertical stress indexes. Unfortunately, seismic reflection data is an indirect measurement of the subsurface elastic properties of interest and therefore we need first to solve the seismic inverse problem (1). |","stochastic models, Seismic Inversion, reservoir modeling, 3D geomechanical model"

Carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is gaining attention as a technique for reducing environmental impact and enhancing crude oil recovery. The injected CO2 reaches supercritical states at certain temperature and pressure conditions to be miscible with crude oil. Then, miscible CO2-oil mixture has lower viscosity and higher mobility than oil alone, leading to increased oil recovery rate. However, carbonate minerals are known to dissolve when CO2 is injected into reservoirs; therefore, it is important to evaluate how properties of rocks in a carbonate rock reservoir are affected by CO2-EOR. In this study, CO2-rich water was injected on carbonate rock samples mainly collected from Middle Eastern oil field and laboratory measurements including SEM image, liquid chromatography analysis, NMR T2 relaxation time and elastic wave velocity measurement, were conducted. The dissolution states of carbonate minerals were investigated by SEM images. Furthermore, liquid chromatography analysis was applied to CO2-rich water flooded through the samples to detect the amount of dissolved carbonate minerals. The porosity increase estimated from the chromatography analysis could be 0.6% or higher at 100 pore volumes (PV) injection. On the other hands, it was observed that samples became shorter as injection increased. The sample shortening may be caused by mechanical compaction associated with pressure loading test. The corresponding porosity reduction due to the sample shortening was estimated; magnitude of the average value of four sample is comparable to porosity increase due to chemical dissolution. Elastic wave velocity measurements showed P-wave velocity decreased in all the samples, as the amount of CO2 -rich water increased; P-wave velocity increase at 100 PV was 2 - 10 %. S-wave velocity decrease was also observed to be 2 - 4% in the most of samples. Moreover, intensity reduction of small size pore was observed by NMR T2 relaxation time analysis. Thus, it was confirmed that effects of CO2-rich water injection on reservoir rock properties cannot be negligible. 
Introduction 
The CO2-EOR technology improves oil recovery rate by injecting CO2 into a reservoir. The injected CO2 reaches supercritical states at certain temperature and pressure conditions (31.1°C and 7.38 MPa or higher), attaining physical properties similar to those of oil and becoming miscible with oil. Mixtures of supercritical CO2 and oil have lower viscosity and higher mobility than oil alone, leading to increased oil recovery rate. This technique is also considered to be an environmentally friendly technique because it injects CO2 underground to prevent emission of CO2 to the atmosphere. 
It has been known that carbonate minerals are dissolved due to the acidity of CO2. The effects of mineral dissolution on the rock properties have been investigated by laboratory measurements, and the results have been reported (e.g., Vanorio et al., 2011; Grombacher et al., 2012). Vanorio et al. (2011) conducted experiments on carbonate rock samples that were injected with CO2. Changes in physical properties, such as acoustic velocity and porosity, were measured, and changes in rock microstructures were observed by SEM images. The results showed that micritic carbonate minerals were dissolved with aqueous solutions of CO2, leading to increased porosity and decreased acoustic velocity. Grombacher et al. (2012) also conducted integrated laboratory measurements including NMR, SEM and CT-scan for carbonate rock samples injected with CO2. They reported changes in acoustic velocity, permeability, and microstructures.|","mineral dissolution, CO2 injection, seismic monitoring, reservoir simulation, rock property"

One of the major challenges during drilling in ultra-deep salt formation in Tarim basin is to predict pore pressure accurately. The salt formation buried at 6000-7800m, which had been affected by tectonic events. Currently, the industry mainly relies on the empirical relations, such as velocities and resistivity trends, to predict pore pressure. Consequently, many investigators have shown these methods are largely based on shale behavior, which reduces the reliability of purely trend-based methods in predicting salt formation overpressure. 
In this paper, pore pressure mechanism can be obtained from the existing wells data-- including the characteristics of geological structure, pore pressure distribution and logging response directly pertinent to the salt formation. A new model for pore pressure prediction in salt formation is proposed based on the small deflection bending theory of thin plate and poroelasticity theory. This model includes in-situ stress state, tectonic deformation curvature and elastic modulus which were not included in the existing models. 
According to the field data analysis, the tectonic compression is the primary overpressure generation mechanism. This approach, based on a rock-physics model, is an improvement over existing pore-pressure prediction methods, which mainly rely on empirical relations. Moreover, it is the fundamental to understand the mechanism of the overpressure generation. 
With more than 45 wells predicted with this proposed model, the average error is less than 8%. Thus, recommendations for drilling in salt formation can be given. 
Introduction 
Pore pressure is the fluid pressure in the pore spaces of porous rock. Hydrostatic pressure is referred to the pressure of fluid columns gravity induced, which is proportional to the fluid density and the vertical heights of fluid columns. Pore pressure varies from hydrostatic pressure. When pore pressure exceeds the hydrostatic pressure at the particular depth, it is defined as overpressure (Zhang, 2011). 
Pore pressure is one of the most important parameters for drilling engineering. Poor knowledge of pore pressure causes high costs, even affects the oilfield production and severely leads to blowout, lost circulation and wellbore instability. Due to the salt characteristic of plastic creep and anisotropy, it has been affected by complex geologic and tectonic events, making it difficult to accurately understand the overpressure generatation mechanism, establish the pore pressure prediction model and calculate pore pressure profile (Saleh, S., 2013; Rizvi, A., 2013). 
Pore pressure, especially, overpressure, is caused by many mechanisms. The currently accepted pore pressure generation mechanisms mainly are: (1) undercompaction (Fertl, 1976); (2) Source mechanisms, includes hydrocarbon generation (Hunt, 1990), smectite to illite digenesis in shales (Dutta, 1983; Dutta, 2002), Thermal (Baker, 1972); (3) Mechanical mechanism, includes shear (Yassir, 1996), Tectonic stress (Traugott, 1997); (4) Lateral pressure transfer in sand (Swarbrick, 1998). In general, there is a predominant mechanism for a special study block. The overpressure generation mechanisms of salt formation are directly related to the nature of tectonics acting on the sediments in published literature. |","P-wave velocity, Elastic modulus, Pore pressure, Salt formation, Tectonic compression"

Tight gas formations often contain natural fractures (NF). In presence of NF, more complex fracture networks may form during the hydraulic treatment. The interaction between fractures may alter the way the hydraulic fracture propagates through the formation, causing a complex network of fractures, which can significantly influence the overall geometry and effectiveness of hydraulic fracture. The hydraulic fracture may cross, dilate or slip into the fracture plane upon its arrival at the natural fractures. Although there have been studies on investigation of the interaction between HF and NF, most of them cannot be applied reliably due to the inherent assumptions in the analytical formulation. In cases of laboratory studies, the limitation of the equipment could also be a factor. With this study a multi-ANFIS model is established to predict the interaction between HF and NF. The advantage of this model is that it is a data-based model. Therefore, as long as there are reliable data the model can work smoothly and easily, so that it can predict the interaction in real time. Results show that the dilation and slippage will be more likely to occur when the approach angle is very low. Whereas, in the case of higher differential horizontal stress, it is more likely that the cross interaction will happen. The significance of this work is to help to predict the interaction between HF and NF, thus optimizing the hydraulic-fracture treatment design parameters in a naturally fractured tight gas reservoir. Insightful parametric sensitivity analyses will also be presented. This model could also be used to study the potential of the deep UAE gas sands, which are naturally fractured. |Introduction |Tight gas with its huge potential all over the world is now playing a critical role in the global energy market. Rogner (1997) estimated that the reserve of tight gas worldwide could be 7405 Tcf. Because of the very low permeability of the tight gas reservoir (usually less than 0.1 mD), it is often required to apply some stimulation work to these reservoirs to get economic flow. One of the primary stimulation technologies is hydraulic fracturing. Tight gas reservoirs often contain natural fractures, and hydraulic-fracture propagation is affected by the natural fractures. Some hydraulic fracture works in these environments are taking advantage of fluid flow from these natural fractures in the reservoir rock while some try to avoid them because the interaction can lead to leak off. The distribution, orientation, and density of the natural fractures is key to proper planning and well scheduling in tight gas reservoirs as well as the interaction between these natural fractures and hydraulic fractures. The existence of the original natural fracture makes it complicated to predict and characterize the hydraulic fractures created in the subsurface due to the interaction of the hydraulic fracture and natural fracture. There are several types of interaction: crossing, slippage, dilation and offset (Gu et al., 2011). Fig.1 shows some of them. All of these will influence the hydraulic work significantly. For example, fracture offset (fracture diversion) and fracture branching result in a reduction, at least locally, of fracture width. Local fracture width reduction may cause proppant bridging and pre-mature screen-out. For instance, hydraulic fracturing in the Minami- Nagoka gas field encountered premature screen-out (Sato, 1999). Based on their report, only 20% of the designed volume of proppant was placed in the formation. Thus, the study of the interaction between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture is complicated but of great importance.|","Hydraulic fracture, Interaction, Natural fracture, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)"

Zubair Formation is the deepest producing Cretaceous reservoir in North Kuwait. This 1,400 ft thick formation was deposited in deltaic to paralic depositional environment with complex sand/shale sequence, structural geometry, mineralogical composition and lateral extent. Drilling wells of any profile has witnessed high non-productive time due to severe wellbore instability issues in the form of stuck pipes, tight holes, hole pack-offs and jarring/fishing operations. So, a number of vertical wells were drilled to drain the reservoir an economic challenge. Current strategic goal in this matured reservoir is to exploit multiple but thin pays by maximizing reservoir contact with high angle multi-lateral wells. 
An integrated 3D Geomechanics study was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, responsible failure mechanisms for wellbore instability were identified: stress induced breakouts, washouts and cavings, failure and fluid invasion associated with shale bedding planes at high deviation and osmotic pressure transmission between Zubair shales and drilling fluid system. Water sensitivity of clays and presence of micro-fractures were also studied on cores of this trouble making formation. In the second phase, calibrated well based 1D Geomechanical models; 3D structural model with high definition faults, facies models indicating lithological changes and drilling experience of latest high angle wells were integrated into a 3D Geomechanical model. The 3D model was tested with data from several offset wells and it was capable of explaining the wellbore failure of these wells. This 3D geomechanical model also helped in predicting mud weight window for any proposed high angle well trajectories. 
Mitigation measures from the study included drilling with Oil Based Mud or High performance water based mud systems with model derived mud weights, micronized sealing polymer to seal-off the laminations and micro-fractures, marble grade Calcium carbonate or resilient graphite to plug wider fractures and high salinity of mud to avoid time-sensitive osmotic flow. 
After implementing these recommendations, six horizontal wells have been drilled successfully. The study has given further confidence to implement an aggressive field development plan for optimal depletion.

Recent technologies developed for drilling, completion, and fracturing in horizontal wells have allowed the oil and gas industry to effectively use multistage fracturing stimulation treatments to help improve production in tight and unconventional gas and oil reservoirs. The fracturing process usually involves placing multiple perforation clusters exposed to the injected fluid in each treatments stage. It has been shown that very strong interactions occur between the fractures propagating from the clusters, which further influence the effectiveness of production following a fracturing treatment. This paper presents a computational methodology to simulate and analyze the major physics associated with the interactions between multiple injections using a tightly coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) numerical model for hydraulic fracturing. This approach uses the finite element method (FEM) to computationally evaluate the stresses and deformation of elastic rock blocks. Nonpenetration contact conditions between adjacent solids, coupled with tensile and shear failure models, are developed to describe fracture evolution and its interaction with the rock blocks. The fluid flow in opened fractures is modeled using the cubic law formulation. The proposed coupling computational method leads to an integrative algebraic system for a set of variables that fully describes this multiphysics phenomenon, including rock block corner displacements and Lagrange multipliers for cases where the blocks are in contact, along with the fluids pressure at junctions of the opened fracture network. The suggested algorithm solves all of the unknowns simultaneously and in a tightly coupled manner. This algorithm is not limited to the specific study of the interactions between hydraulically induced fractures from different perforation clusters, but it can also be used to properly describe the interactions between hydraulically induced fractures and natural fractures. Yet, because of the existence of natural fractures, the interactions between multiple injections become more complicated than the interactions between only hydraulically induced fractures. In these cases, the natural fractures between multiple injections provide a stronger interaction and pathways for injected fracturing fluid between multiple injections. The spacing of injection clusters is studied for its effect on fracture length and the width of fractures for each injection cluster. |","fluid-structure interaction, multiple injection, computational algorithm"

Drilling and completion of unconventional shale formation is one of the fastest growing technologies in tight shale formation. The number of wells drilled in search of gas in shale is increasing rapidly since the beginning of 2000. Cementing these wells poses several challenges. The productive zone throughout the play has been developed using a combination of vertical and horizontal wells. Production from the reservoirs has been optimized by using various completion and stimulation techniques. Currently in an effort to reduce environmental impact, increase the net present value, and maximize reservoir pressure and contact into the thin sweet spots, horizontal wells have gained popularity in these shale formations. The performance of these reservoirs depends upon the completion and stimulation methods used because the matrix permeability is too low for commercial production of gas. The wellbore area must be increased in order to reach the immobile hydrocarbons. The techniques and materials used for fracturing these wells and enhance the effective wellbore drainage radius are numerous. 
Previous experience from these formations showed some enhancement for vertical wells completed with hydraulic fracturing. The early stimulation techniques were primarily nitrogen-foam fracture treatments which yielded economic rates necessary for further filed development of these formations. Better enhancement is expected from the same formations if horizontal wells are drilled coupled with multistage hydraulic fracturing.  This enhancement can further be improved by stimulating with slick water and cross-linked gels.  This paper will discuss the challenges during cementing and stimulation of horizontal well. Finally, materials that are most economically viable in these formations will be enumerated. 
Introduction 
Unconventional reservoirs have become an increasing source of natural gas over the last 10 years in the US. Tight shale, tight sand, and coal-bed methane formations are considered unconventional reservoirs because of the operations involved to economically produce them. In general, these formations are cemented and must be stimulated by fracturing. Among a few of the successful developments of unconventional plays in the US, are the Barnett, Fayetteville, Marcellus, Bakken and Eagle Ford Shales. Unconventional natural gas productions increased nearly 70% since 2000 and have now rendered the US a net exporter of natural gas. Unconventional shale reservoirs are complex due to the naturally occurring matrix permeability of the formations, ranging from the micro-Darcy ( <U+03BC>D) to nano-Darcy (nD) scale, which is too low to produce the hydrocarbons unless induced by MSHF. The reservoirs can also be highly compartmentalized, with highly anisotropic properties. Shales are typically composed of variable types and amounts of clay minerals and quartz grains while exhibiting a typical gray color. Addition of variable amounts of minor constituents alters the color of the rock. For example, the Barnett shale rock is the source rock as well as the reservoir rock. Barnett Shale is a geological formation located in the Bend Arch-Fort Worth Basin. It consists of sedimentary rocks of Mississippian age (354323 million years ago) in Texas. The formation underlies the city of Fort Worth and underlies 5,000 mi<U+00B2> (13,000 km<U+00B2>) and at least 17 counties.|","Cementing, Stimulation, Unconventional, Resources, Horizontal"

The easy oil is gone and current field developments requires different approaches to produce oil and gas reserves in the most effective and economic ways, keeping the safety standards as high as technologically possible. 
The use of dynamic hydraulic modelling software to predict and establish wellbore pressures and temperature in challenging wells (e.g.: narrow margin window, HPHT or mature/depleted reservoirs), enable Drilling Engineers (DE) to make the well design within the operational limits for drilling, tripping, casing and cementing operations, thus allowing access to reserves. However, this process must start with a management of change in the philosophy that still is being applied today in planning and operational procedures (steady state modelling). 
This process starts with an in-depth review of the expected pore/fracture pressures, wellbore stability window and temperature profile along the well trajectory. The prediction of the operational window for each of the well sections will then be used to review the optimal mud weight including the dynamic ECD/ESD management and dynamic kick tolerance limitation for the proposed fluid, considering the operational transient effects on the well design. Subsequently, dynamic surge and swab and cementing calculations are included in the review to ensure that pore and fracture pressure limits are maintained during all operations. Bottomhole temperatures as well as surface temperatures can then be reviewed and predicted to ensure that downhole tools and other components can be used according to tool specifications. 
A combination of drilling techniques combined with real time pore pressure predictions, dynamic modelling and online drilling systems supported by the powerful computational technologies available nowadays, will change the way we plan and work our challenging fields in the near future. 
This paper will explore the fundamentals of the dynamic drilling modelling required during the well planning process, in addition to a brief description of online drilling systems, to allow safe access to challenging fields. 
Introduction 
The well planning process is extensively known across the industry since it has been in practice for more than 100 years. However, as we are reaching deeper reservoirs and working in more challenging conditions such as harsh environments, deep water, high pressure high temperature (HPHT) or mature/depleted fields, common design practices are reaching the capability limits and therefore, are required to re-think the old ways in order to produce new solutions. 
With todays high and fast computational capacities available for all disciplines, it is now possible to introduce very complex equations and analyze, almost in real-time the interaction between the different phenomenonss affecting the drilling process. This enable the engineers to produce more accurate results and therefore, to have a better and realistic representation of reality during the early planning phase. 
Lately, many operators have decided to move into transient solutions that offers a more realistic modelling of the system and allow them to open new opportunities and boundaries for drilling practices that before where unavailable.|","Well Planning, Dynamic Well Control, Operational Margings, Challenging scenarios, Dynamic Drilling Modelling"

For the studies on hydraulic fracturing (HF), reservoir formations with natural fractures and their interaction with hydraulic fractures are more concerned. Stochastic Microcracks Rock Model is the microscopic numerical geo-model, which applies the Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic microcracks using Distinct Element Method (DEM). This model compiled in dynamic modeling codes presents more realistic behavior of the rock formations. For characterizing rock mass, the microseismic events are wildly regarded as the indicators of shear slip, and for unconventional reservoir, the induced microseismicity (MS) by HF can be applied in creation more flowing paths to increase very low permeability . Therefore, it is essential to investigate the MS source mechanisms in the rock mass, and with the effect of pre-existing fractures. In this paper, a modified analytical model of microseismicity is derived and verified with numerical simulations coupling Discrete Element Method by Particle Flow Code (PFC3D). The results show that there are the correlation between shearing microseismic event and interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures; and fracture fluid could also contribute to the shear failure during stimulation. This combined numerical modeling provides a unique alternative method for understanding the controlling factors of MS generation and its effect on stimulation. In addition, microseismic events possess the potential to characterize the fracture geometry qualitatively, to evaluate the fluid behavior in fractured formation, to predict fracture propagation, and ultimately to optimize stimulation design.|","Distinct Element Method, Stochastic Microcracks, Microseismicity, Hydraulic Fracturing"

The X field is located in The Sultanate of Oman. It consists of stacked fractured carbonate reservoirs with Natih and Shuaiba Formations. Historically the field has been studied and stalled over the years (1999, 2005 and 2008). Making an integrated development plan for the X field is considered as challenging for the following reasons: 1) we are dealing with three different reservoirs at the same location; 2) the field has sparse datasets for the different reservoirs; 3) fractures properties differ within reservoirs; 4) the three reservoirs contain different hydrocarbon types; 5) The development is targeting relatively short transition zone hydrocarbon columns ; 6) fluid contacts are highly variable and non flat; 7) the oil in the shallow reservoir is biodegraded and the gs oil contact does not match the oil the bubble point pressure; 8) the field is producing at high H2S level. 
As a consequence of the above the field development is confronted with a wide range of uncertainties in the production forecasts (between low and high cases). Surface design having to accommodate such large ranges in the production forecast translates into a project that is economically unattractive. 
To unlock the X field resource volume, a two-fold strategy was adopted: 
1) Big Loop and Decision Driven Modelling, and 
2) Concept engineering designing the cost while maintaining the project key value drivers. 
The Big Loop methodology enabler can be defined as the process of describing reservoirs conceptually to explore through modelling the uncertainties impacting major decisions. It results in exploring the subsurface unknowns in the decision space without anchoring to a base case. The Big Loop has resulted in the identification of the most relevant uncertainties in X field which led to drilling five appraisal wells and four well interference campaigns in 2012-2013. The appraisal results have proven GOGD as the most favourable recovery mechanism for the two deeper reservoirs; for the shallower reservoir uncertainty remains too large and the recommendation for an early production system in combination of a surveillance plan is proposed. 
Optimisation of the compressor size has been key to unlock the economic feasibility of this development. It has lead to the definition of the maximum affordable capacity and the operating envelope for production phasing. 
In conclusion the integration with surface design has driven the cost, and the Big Loop methodology has enabled the identification of appraisal needs and the optimum development mechanism. The combination of surface design for the three reservoirs and subsurface uncertainty screening has resulted in an economically feasible and robust project.|","Subsurface"

Characterisation of the mechanical and petrophysical properties of quarried sandstones was conducted to assess their suitability as reservoir rocks. Five sets of outcrop sandstones, covering a range of porosity and permeability were identified as potential geomechanical analogues for North Sea sandstones. A comprehensive series of mechanical and petrophysical tests were undertaken in order to evaluate the mechanical properties of the sandstones (modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio and compressive strength) over a range of confining pressure likely to be encountered in the North Sea and basic petrophysical characteristics defined by grain density, porosity and permeability. The quarried sandstones have been found to be suitable reservoir analogues. The post failure sand production potential of the sandstones was examined by investigating the failure modes and analysing the granulometric characteristics of the comminution debris created by post peak strength sliding along shear surfaces. 
Data generated from the laboratory testing were used as input parameters to investigate the propensity of sand debris production and formation stability in a hypothetical wellbore using the yield energy model. This model quantifies the energy available for rock fragmentation and describes the extent of the yield zone as a function of production rates and drawdown pressures. The geomechanical appraisal, which is a necessary component of the approach, also serves as a source of representative mechanical properties data available as input for reservoir simulators and other rock mechanics related analysis. The model was found to be applicable for a wide range of sandstones. 
1 Introduction 
The stress state of a sandstone reservoir and subsequent changes in the in situ stress state of the reservoir due to petroleum related operations is a significant factor on the performance and recovery of producing assets. Rock strength properties are affected by stress changes due to drilling process and production/injection operations. Yield and fragmentation of rock occurs when the rock is exposed to stresses which exceed its failure criterion, creating a yield zone and hence the potential for well instability and sand production. Sand debris production prediction and wellbore stability studies are among some major activities that rely on rock mechanical data. Thus, the ability to predict the mechanical parameters of a reservoir formation is key to avoiding wellbore instability and evaluating the sanding potential of the reservoir.Rock mechanical properties for petroleum engineering applications are usually obtained from direct measurement on reservoir core samples or alternatively, indirectly by applying correlations of mechanical data with other core and log parameters (Edlmann et al., 1998). Since none of the correlation methods can directly yield static strength value without appreciable uncertainty, laboratory testing on core samples remains the most reliable means of obtaining reservoir rock mechanical parameters. However, the acquisition of core samples from whole reservoir interval is prohibitively expensive (Ameen et al., 2009), in most cases the number of  representative cores are insufficient for a complete mechanical characterisation across relevant intervals of the reservoir (Holt et al., 2005). The utilisation of analogue sandstone samples can offer a cost effective means of evaluating reservoir strength parameters against the prohibitive expensive and unreliable representative core samples from the field. A question that commonly arises is how representative are the analogue samples compared to the actual reservoir samples. It is essential for an analogue to possess the salient and critical features of the reservoir rock particular in relation to the objective of the test. In order to satisfy these requirements, it becomes absolutely necessary to establish both physical and mechanical relationship between the analogue samples and the reservoir rocks.|","Rock mechanics, Prediction of Debris Production, Reservoir Analogues"

Saudi Aramco is drilling horizontal wells along the minimum horizontal stress direction in an attempt to generate multiple transverse fractures during stimulation to increase gas production and enhance recovery. However, drilling operations in these wells are difficult due to wellbore instability because of the higher mud weights required to minimize formation breakout due to prevailing in-situ stress conditions. Increased mud weight also led to higher differential pressure across the variably depleted reservoir layers, which when coupled with formation instability, created greater challenges for the drilling team. These conditions resulted in a significantly increased number of stuck pipe incidents, incurring noticeably high nonproductive time including loss of bottomhole assemblies in the hole. To address these problems, an integrated approach between drilling expertise, applied geomechanics, and advanced mud logging technology was applied to successfully overcome stuck pipe events arising from wellbore instability and differential sticking. Additionally, the drilling and tripping practices were customized to confront borehole instability issues. Further, to account for formation heterogeneity and varying in-situ stresses, the predrill Mechanical-Earth-Model (MEM) was updated during drilling using Real-Time Drilling Geomechanics (RTDG). In addition, advanced cutting return-monitoring technology was  used, which helped hole cleaning to minimize the risk of stuck pipe due to formation failure (excessive cuttings).

It is proposed that very low permeability formations are possible candidates for CO2 sequestration. Further, experimental studies have shown that shale formations have huge affinity to adsorb CO2, the order of 5 to 1 compared to the methane. Therefore, potential sequestration of CO2 in shale formations leading to enhanced gas recovery (EGR) will be a promising while challenging target for the oil and gas industry. On the other side, hydraulic re-fracturing treatment of shale gas wells is currently gaining more attention due to the poor performance of shale gas reservoirs after a couple years of production. Hence, investigating and comparing the performance of CO2-EGR with the re-fracturing treatment is essential for the future economic viability of depleted shale gas reservoirs. This paper presents a systematic comparison of the effect of these two processes on improving gas production performance of unconventional reservoirs, which is not well understood and has not been studied thoroughly in the literature. 
In this paper, a shale gas field data has been evaluated and incorporated in our simulations for both CO2-EGR and re-fracturing treatment purposes. Numerical simulations are performed using local grid refinement (LGR) in order to accurately model the non-linear pressure drop. Also, a dual-porosity/dual-permeability model is incorporated in the reservoir simulation model. Further, the uncertainties associated with inter-related set of geologic and engineering parameters are evaluated and quantified for re-fracturing treatment through several simulation runs. This comprehensive sensitivity study helps in understanding the key reservoir and fracture properties that affect the production performance and enhanced gas recovery in shale gas reservoirs. 
The results showed that re-fracturing treatment outperforms CO2-EGR due to the pronounced effect on cumulative methane gas production. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis showed that the characteristics of reservoir matrix including permeability and porosity are the most influential parameters for re-fracturing treatment. The findings of this study recommend hydraulic re-fracturing of shale reservoirs at first for enhancing gas production followed by CO2 injection at a later time. This work provides field operators with more insight into maximizing gas recovery from unconventional shale gas reservoirs using re-fracturing stimulation, CO2 injection, or a combination of both methods. 
Introduction 
Unconventional shale reservoirs are the fastest-growing natural gas resources that secure the United States energy supply for decades to come. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has estimated 800 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas stored in shale unconventional resources. As a result, development plans for natural gas production has increased since that time. Economically unfeasible production of natural gas from these tight formations resulted in recent advancements in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies.  Considerable number of multi-stage hydraulic fracturing of shale gas wells enabled industry to unlock shale formations and achieve economic production. Nevertheless, very rapid decline in gas production from these shale reservoirs necessitates either drilling new wells or considering enhanced gas recovery methods to boost gas production and achieve stable economic trend. In this paper, two different EGR methods are investigated and systematically compared in terms of their efficiency in enhancing gas production. The first method is re-fracturing treatment in order to revive a shale gas well, which has failed to achieve economic gas production rates. The second proposed method is CO2 injection by means of storage and sequestration as well as enhancing gas recovery. |","CO2 Sequestration, Enhanced Gas Recovery, Shale Gas, Unconventional Reservoirs, Re-fracturing Treatment"

A new logging-while-drilling (LWD) sonic tool was successfully deployed in a large development project in the Middle East.  The new LWD sonic tool offers robust compressional and shear measurements, irrespective of mud speed, and Stoneley information for a wide range of applications. The acquisition of LWD sonic measurements can be challenging. The introduction of the new tool with a novel hardware design, extensive tool modeling, and an alternative approach to data handling has significantly improved both overall data quality and the viability of advanced answer products while drilling. 
The fundamentals of both wireline and LWD sonic measurements are similar; however, differences in the measurements dictated by the deployment environment need to be considered. LWD tools are deployed on a drillstring and have a large diameter. Wireline tools are much smaller and are deployed on wireline after drilling is completed. Operational frequencies, acquired waveform modes, and transmitter-receiver source spacings are also different. The most fundamental difference is that the new LWD tool uses quadrupole technology to acquire shear slownesses in slow formations (shear formation slowness slower than mud speed), whereas, in the same environment, the wireline tool relies on dipole technology. 
Although there is considerable literature that discusses waveform quality, processing, and interpretation of wireline sonic measurements, very few such studies exist for   LWD sonic measurements. In addition, no studies compare the measurements. To investigate the interpretation and use of the new LWD tool and to compare it with wireline sonic tool technology, both methods were deployed in the same wellbores in a large development project in the Middle East. Most observed disparities were across washed out boreholes where data quality from both wireline and LWD tools was negatively affected by the borehole environment. 
Introduction 
Sonic measurements have been around for a long time and have evolved significantly since their introduction in the 1950s. They have applications in a broad spectrum of disciplines including geophysics, petrophysics, geology, geomechanics, completion and reservoir characterization. From the simple applications for correlating surface seismic to borehole logs, the measurements have expanded to provide valuable information about formation lithology, pore fluid, pore pressure, rock strength, borehole stability, formation alteration, cement quality, stress direction and magnitude. 
Significant advances in sonic technology have been made on wireline (WL) over the last decades, providing shear and compressional measurements on routine basis, regardless of formation type. Using monopole and dipole sources, wireline tools are capable of measuring shear and compressional slownesses in hard and soft formations irrespective of mud velocity. New generation logging-while-drilling (LWD) sonic tools have appeared, extending the frontiers of acoustics measurements by providing the same measurements for real time informed decisions. The real time data from LWD sonic helps us to analyze borehole stability, compute mud weight windows and casing shoe points and predict pore pressure in addition to the traditional applications of well to seismic tie and  formation porosity. These applications, using both real time and memory data, have relied mostly on the measurements of formation compressional due to the difficulty in obtaining shear slowness in the LWD environment, especially in unconsolidated slow formations since the older generation of LWD Monopole tools was limited to providing formation shear slowness in fast formations only. |","Case Study, Large Development Project, LWD, Middle East, Sonic While Drilling"

Wellbore instability during drilling, completion, and production is important and costly issue in many oil and gas fields. Field observations show that stress-related wellbore instability challenges are frequently encountered. Estimating stresses and mechanical properties is a key to the success of drilling, completion and production operations. Knowledge of accurate Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) is essential for understanding wellbore stability, perforation efficiency, and sanding tendency. UCS along the wellbore and perforation is a key input of failure criteria and can be best obtained from laboratory core testing that are mostly performed in the reservoir section. Cores from the overburden formation are rarely taken, although most wellbore stability related issues are encountered in this section of the well. 
In this study, wellbore stability modeling was conducted using Finite Element Modeling (FEM) to predict induced stresses and yielded zone around the wellbore in the elastoplastic media. Elastoplastic models were used in conjunction with the Mohr-Coulomb and modified Lade yield criteria. 
UCS is calculated by matching the resultant stresses around wellbore with dipole radial profiles from the Acoustic Scanning platform. The damage or yielded zone is interpreted by means of volumetric strain analysis. This damage provides an indication of the potential breakout that might occur during drilling, thereby giving an indication of the risks to wellbore instability. 
This novel technique is applied to compute wellbore stability in the Khuff and pre-Khuff Formations in Saudi Arabia. The methodology can be applied to other locations using similar approach that combines acoustic radial response and FEM. 
Introduction 
Subsurface formations are under a balanced stress condition before drilling a hole. Such equilibrium will be disturbed when a hole is drilled. Although drilling fluids can partially support the wellbore wall, the drilling of the borehole can cause the redistribution of the stresses around the wellbore, Fig. 1. If the stress concentration exceeds rock strength, failure in the near-wellbore may occur. 
With the increased trend towards the drilling of highly deviated and horizontal wells, the operations are becoming more economically and technically challenging because of wellbore stability related issues.|","Unconfined Compressive Strength, Wellbore Stability, Elastoplastic"

The Marcellus Shale is one of the main U.S. shale plays with more than 140 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of recoverable gas/condensate (E.I.A) in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Using the appropriate completion and stimulation designs for reservoirs in a given location is crucial to increase the productivity of the play. Understanding rock properties and reservoir characteristics in gas condensate area and their behaviors during the well stimulation is necessary in order to optimize treatment design. This case study aims at optimizing well and completion design parameters such as well spacing, lateral length, azimuth or hydraulic fracturing properties and improving well productivity. An integrated reservoir study involving geomechanics, fracture design and production analysis was carried out, coupled to a multivariable statistical analysis. The purpose of this paper is to apply multivariable statistical analysis in conjunction with production analysis to understand the relationships between rock properties and hydraulic fracturing efficiency within the reservoir. Fifty percent of the Marcellus Shale is composed of clay in the area of interest and typically, clay shales are anisotropic in strength and deformability. The brittle failure characteristics vary from east to west of the play which can affect the proppant transport and ultimately the well productivity. The investigation is based on both proprietary and public information data for the Marcellus formation (around the area of interest in Marshal County, West Virginia). Production proxies, such as maximum gas and condensate rate in the first 12 producing months were selected and merged with well completion and stimulation data. Final data sets were then subjected to a multivariable statistical analysis and a commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application was used to understand geographical performance variation within the play. Fracture modeling and Rate Transient Analysis (RTA) were applied to this study to identify flow regimes and obtain determine some hydraulic fracture and reservoir properties. At last, the relationships between well performances, completion design and reservoir behavior were better understood.|","Hydraulic Fracturing Modeling, Rate Transient Analysis, Marcellus Shale, production analysis, Multivariable statistical analysis"

To extend areal coverage for maximum reservoir contact from a single offshore platform, Korchagina oil field is developed with Extended Reach (ER) wells with MD up to 8km, TVD 1.5km. The main target of Korchagina field is Neokomian sandstone formation with large gas cap that necessitates field development with horizontal ICD sand screen completions to minimize early gas breakthrough. 
In 2011 a task was set to work out set of solutions that would convey ICD sand screens to TD in Korchagina ER environment, with openhole coverage up to 5000m, and to design completion elements around these solutions. 
At planning phase industry expertise  completion practices in projects operating in similar ER environment was reviewed, and existing to date technologies to complete ER wells were analyzed. 
Existing technologies and practices did not provide sufficiently robust and flexible solutions for Korchagina ER environment. Hence, innovative solution was proposed  Rotating sand screens to TD, with contingency to run in stages if rotation limit is expected to be exceeded based on drilling results. 
Further, design of completion equipment was reviewed to accommodate high torque and rotation capability: direct wrap sand screen media with proven sand retention performance in high torque; integral centralizers, to transfer rotational motion at contact points to reduce drag; high torque connections. Paper discusses in details the solutions proposed and design of completion equipment. 
In 2 years 11 ERD wells were completed with TD reaching 7996m MD at 1565m TVD and openhole coverage up to 4700m. Of these 11 wells, in 3 wells actual friction factors came low enough to allow completion run conventionally, in 8 wells rotation was required at 800m-3000m off TD. The results are presented in the paper. 
Based on successful results of application, rotation is set as requirement for completion design for all the wells of current Korchagina field. 
Introduction 
Yuri Korchagina field was discovered in 2000 with 2D seismic and Shirotnaya exploration wells. There are two target formations: Neokomian of Lower Cretaceous period and Volzhskiy of Upper Jurassic age, separated by clay layer of 4-7m thickness. Main development target is Neokomian sediment, which consist of 3 main sand bodies: Layer 1, 2 and 3. Layers are 34-37m, 16-26m and 6m thick and consist of sandstone/aleurolites. These target layers are separated by clay layers: 2.4-11m and 7m thick. All 3 target layers are in single hydrodynamic pressure system with one GOC reported at 1517.2m and one OWC at 1537.1m, with resultant oil column of 19.9m and gas column of 70m. 
Field structure consists of two connected anticlines and is 20km long by 5km wide. Field development counts for 33 wells to be drilled from a single platform. To achieve maximum aerial coverage for increased drainage and field characterization the well targets are widely spread out. Reaching to these targets from single platform requires ER drilling and completion, with step-out up to 6000m, see Figure 1.|","Rotating sand screens, ICD, Extended reach completion, torque and drag, ERD"

An integrated field development study was performed to develop a shale oil field onshore Australia.  Preliminary reservoir characterization indicated that the primary reservoir is very tight with permeability approximately equal to or less than 0.001 mD, containing mainly oil of API gravity close to 41°. Thus, the reservoir is a good candidate for multistage hydraulic fracturing of a long horizontal well oriented along the minimum horizontal stress to achieve a commercially viable recovery level. A geomechanical model was developed for the field characterizing in-situ stresses, direction of the minimum horizontal stress and rock elastic properties for appropriate well orientation and hydraulic fracture design. The primary challenge in hydraulic fracturing optimization for this reservoir was optimizing the treatment to fracture the entire gross thickness of approximately 600 ft while achieving as long a fracture as possible to maximize the recovery. This objective required optimization of fracturing fluid viscosity, injection rate and perforation interval to overcome the stress barriers within the reservoir. The final stage of optimization involved the number of transverse fractures on the horizontal well (i.e. fracture spacing) incorporating the forecast of post-fracture production and net present value for every alternative scenario.  Required fluid volume, proppant mass and pump capacity were useful in estimating the total well drilling and completion cost. When the total well cost was compared against the revenue from the predicted recovery resulting from the optimum fracture treatment, the field was found to be marginal. The overall study enabled decision-making for future drilling, completion and production operations in the field. 
Introduction 
Hydraulic fracturing is essential to commercial development of extremely tight shale reservoirs. For extremely tight shale reservoirs, the merits and demerits of fracturing by high viscosity fluids (cross-linked gel), low viscosity fluids (linear gel and slick water) and energized fluids (liquefied CO2 and N2) are well addressed in the literature from different aspects (Jennings 1996; Montgomery 2013a, 2013b; Reynolds, et al. 2014; Patel et al., 2014). The primary effort is, however, always to fracture the entire target zone by deploying various mechanisms, or hybridization of more than one fracturing fluid, or both. Extremely low permeability reservoirs, on the other hand, require multistage fracturing of long horizontal wells with long fractures to increase the post-fracture production rate. High-rate injection of a low-viscosity fracturing fluid such as slick water creates a long fracture but hardly drives the fracture along the height. Several fractures along the height by multistage injection may cover the entire target thickness, but achieving such multiple long fractures depends on the contrast in stress and rock properties within the target zone. Even if vertically stacked multiple long fractures can be achieved, such a fracturing scenario is primarily good for vertical or slightly deviated wells that intersect vertically the entire target zone. To obtain the benefit of vertically stacked fracturing on horizontal wells in a relatively thick zone, multiple wells must be placed at various levels which may not be cost-effective. Additionally, it is extremely challenging to transport proppants up to the fracture tip by slick water though a long fracture can be created. Therefore, an overall optimization study incorporating reservoir properties, the pattern of fracture growth, post-fracture production and net present value is essential in deciding the optimum well type (vertical or horizontal), the fracturing fluid system and the fracture configuration.|","Production Modelling, Shale Reservoir, Multistage Fracturing, Hydraulic Fracturing, Unconventional"

Wettability is a key petrophysical property which impacts multiphase flow in porous media. It is generally believed that rock wettability in subsurface reservoirs has been established by adsorption of organic molecules during oil invasion and that the majority of carbonate reservoirs are mixed-wet or oil-wet as a consequence hereof. Thus, insight into which molecules actually bind to the carbonate rock, estimation of molecule-specific relative adsorption affinities and the importance of the crystalline calcite structure is pivotal to decipher the origin of wettability in carbonate reservoirs  and modification hereof in EOR processes. 
We applied advanced density functional theory (DFT) to calculate adsorption energies of 36 different organic molecules on top of calcite with two different crystalline structures, namely flat {104} and rugged calcite {318}. We made an in-depth statistical analysis of the data and the work stands out to our knowledge as the most comprehensive and systematic quantitative study of adsorption of organic molecules reported to date. We show that molecules with a carboxylic group adsorb to calcite with highest affinity and that all 36 molecules bind with significantly higher affinity to rugged calcite as compared to flat calcite. Strikingly, this adsorption enhancement was most significant for molecules with functional groups containing nitrogen and oxygen. This suggests that regions in carbonate rocks with rugged surfaces of calcite have an inherent thermodynamic preference to become more oil-wet as compared to flat calcite surfaces when exposed to organic molecules with polar functional groups. 
We applied COSMO (conductor-like screening model) theory in conjunction with our recently published Generalized Sigma Moment (GSM) model to derive a predictive correlation to estimate calcite type-specific molecular adsorption energies. We derived two models with significant prediction power (R2=0.95 and R2=0.9) and show from nonlinear regression and clustering analysis that the electrostatic polarity of the organic molecules is the single most important determinant of adsorption energy. 
The thorough analysis and the correlations we present here are valuable and powerful tools for quantitative prediction of adsorption energies of wettability-modifying organic molecules and for deciphering the origin of wettability of carbonate rocks. |","Organic molecules, COSMO theory, Adsorption energy, Adsorption, Calcite"

Drilling a shale formation with no borehole problems can be a challenging task. With high content of clays, shale formations are prone to swelling, dispersion, tight hole and other problems. Those problems are well-documented in literature. Different types of clays give different types of problems. For example, when it is exposed to water, a shale sample with a high percentage of smectite tends to swell while another shale sample with a high percentage of kaolinite tends to disintegrate and disperse. The mechanism that destabilizes reactive shale when it comes in contact with water differs from on shale sample to another. It is important to know which mechanism is taking place in order to be proactive and inhibit the drilling fluid with the appropriate inhibitor. It is also important to characterize the shale sample in terms of its geological structure, mineralogical composition and interaction potential. 
Shale characterization and testing methods include but not limited to the following: X-ray analysis, degradation and reorientation evaluation using scanning electron microscope (SEM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) determination, swelling test, dispersion test, slake durability test, bulk hardness test, accretion test, shale membrane test, inhibition durability test and uniaxial and triaxial compression tests. 
Different types of shale inhibitors and stabilizers have been used in the industry such as: potassium chloride, calcium chloride, silicates, polyamines, glycol and lignosulfonate. Each of them has a mechanism by which it can inhibit the hydration, disintegration and dispersion of clays in the presence of water. 
This paper discusses the physio-chemical and chemico-mechanical effects of shale-drilling fluid interactions and the associated drilling problems that are most frequently encountered while drilling shales formations. It also reviews the most common shale testing methods used to evaluate the interaction potential of various shale-drilling fluid systems. Moreover, the paper describes different mechanisms by which shale can be inhibited and wellbore stability problems can be mitigated. 
Introduction 
About 75% of the formations drilled worldwide are shale formations with a high sensitivity to water-based muds. These formations are well-known for their high clay content and associated wellbore instability problems (Steiger, 1992). When clay-rich rocks are exposed to water, they start to react and behave like unconsolidated rocks. The extent of reaction, the mechanism and the consequences differ from one type of clay to another. For example, kaolinite clay tends to disperse in water, illite clay tends to disperse but to a lesser extent while smectite clay tends to swell. Because shales from different zones have different clay mineralogy, the response of every shale zone is usually different when exposed to water. 
In addition to swelling and dispersion, another source of wellbore instability while drilling shale formations is the disturbance of stresses around the borehole. The stresses around the borehole can be resolved into three main stresses: vertical stress, minimum horizontal stress and maximum horizontal stress. These stresses are altered and rearranged depending on several factors such as hydrostatic pressure of drilling fluid, swelling and hydration pressure effect and the overbalance pressure used to support the borehole wall. Because of the low permeability and high capillary suction of shale matrix,  a phenomenon called mud pressure penetration develops when drilling shale with overbalance pressure. An increase in the pore fluid pressure will result from the small volume penetrating into the wellbore and, therefore, wellbore instability will be triggered (Riley et al., 2012)|","inhibition, method, Drilling fluid, shale, durability"

The hydraulic fracturing technology is widely applied in tight reservoirs, including shale reservoirs, as one of the established reservoir stimulation methodologies to enhance the productivity. Even though the hydraulic fracturing is currently a common technique, there are remaining challenges in offshore fields with the high degree of geological and geomechanical uncertainties. In offshore hydraulic fracturing operations, key issues are the limited deck space for the required equipment on-board and economical aspects of the surface equipment including stimulation vessels due to the limited number of dedicated offshore stimulation vessels in the world. In addition, the limited reservoir information brings uncertainties in the hydraulic fracture design and causes difficulties in finalizing the operation plans from the timing and logistics point of view. 
This paper contains the first part of the two successive parts of a case study will be shown on successful optimization and productivity enhancement of actual offshore hydraulic fracturing for a deep tight gas reservoir with considerably limited formation data and under a high-pressure and high-temperature (HP/HT) environment. This successful operation was recognized as a landmark in this region, in terms of the first hydraulic fracturing operation in the offshore Abu Dhabi. 
In this paper (part 1), we describe how the flexible hydraulic fracture design led to an efficient productivity enhancement. The hydraulic fracture design was optimized by the integrated data acquisition strategy and the successive flexible adjustment from the design stage at office to the actual main treatment at wellsite. The relevant fracture design components like proppant usage and size can be optimized, based on sensitivity studies assuming not only all possible geological and geomechanical circumstances but also the actual pre-frac well test and data-frac results. In part 2, the key factors will be highlighted on this successful hydraulic fracturing result against the difficulties from operational point of view (Al Ameri et al. 2014). 
The work flow and successful strategy in our hydraulic fracturing design and execution can be applied to other offshore tight-sand gas reservoirs including those under HP/HT condition.

Driven by field logistics in an unconventional setting, a well may undergo weeks to months of shut-in after hydraulic-fracture stimulation. In unconventional reservoirs, field experiences indicate that such shut-in episodes may improve well productivity significantly while reducing water production. Multiphase-flow mechanisms were found to explain this behavior. Aided by laboratory relative permeability and capillary pressure data, and their dependency on stress in a shale-gas reservoir, the flow-simulation model was able to reproduce the suspected water-blocking behavior.

Estimating formation permeability as a function of porosity, grain size, and the quantity and structure of fines is important in reservoir engineering. One can use the Kozeny-Carman equation to estimate the permeability of clean, unconsolidated media as a function of porosity and grain size, but it does not account for the quantity and structure of deposited fines. This study shows how incorporating of the volume of fines and a dimensionless bulk factor into the Kozeny-Carman equation can be used to model how the quantity and structure of deposited fines control permeability. Several experimental studies from the literature are analyzed, representing a range of fines (type and diameter), porous media, fluids, and Darcy velocity. These studies indicate that, when other variables are held constant, experiments conducted at a higher Darcy velocity result in less plugging. For each experiment, a dimensionless bulk factor in the Kozeny-Carman equation was fitted, with use of the root-mean-square method, to best match the experimental data. Fitted values of the bulk factor were then correlated with the Peclet number to investigate how the structure of fines, quantified by the bulk factor, depends on the characteristics of the porous media, the depositing colloids, and the Darcy velocity. Larger bulk factors are observed at a lower Peclet number, when diffusive transport dominates, which could result from more-dendritic deposits. Smaller bulk factors are observed at higher Peclet numbers, when advective transport dominates, which could result from deposits that are more compact. By understanding how the bulk factor, and, therefore, the extent of permeability reduction, depends on the Peclet number, one can optimize pumping schemes. The primary application of this work is to optimize well-pumping rates to prevent or manage plugging that results from the deposition of fines in initially clean, unconsolidated porous media, including both geologic formations and gravelpacks used for sand control.|","permeability, fines, Kozeny-Carman, formation damage"

Hydraulic fracturing in shale formations induces microseismic events in a region we refer to as the microseismic volume. Many of these microseismic events are signatures of failure in the formation that are believed to be a result of induced unpropped (IU) fractures beyond the primary propped fracture. Areally extensive microseismicity may be evidence that these IU fractures occur and extend spatially beyond the propped fracture during pumping in many unconventional reservoirs. We present evidence that these fractures close over time after pumping is stopped and that this closure of IU fractures can have a significant impact on stress interference between fractures. To illustrate these effects, microseismic and radioactive-tracer data are presented for four laterals drilled and fractured from a single pad. Two wells on this pad were fractured with the consecutive-fracturing sequence, and the other two wells were fractured with the zipper-fracturing sequence. Geomechanical simulations were performed to model the pad scenario and explain the microseismic and tracer observations, with emphasis on the two different fracturing sequences. Our simulations show that the opening of the IU fractures results in significant temporary changes to the stress field in the rock. One consequence of this is that later fracture stages tend to propagate into the open-fracture networks of IU fractures created earlier because of stress reorientation. This can lead to inefficient usage of fluid, proppant, and capital because the region that is being stimulated has already been stimulated by the previous stage. By analyzing the net pressure, radioactive-tracer data, and microseismic data from the four-well pad, we show that these IU fractures close over time because the fracture fluid leaks off. This reduces the stress shadow, and subsequent induced fractures are no longer subjected to the significantly altered stresses, allowing for more-efficient fracture-network coverage by subsequent fractures in a horizontal well. On the basis of the data presented and computer simulations, we propose the idea of maximizing the time between fracturing in the microseismic volume of a recently fractured region (within operational constraints). The time required for the IU fractures to close can be estimated from our models and varies on the basis of the reservoir and fluid properties from several hours to days. One example of how this is accomplished in practice is zipper fractures.

Production and drawdown data from 10 subsea deepwater fractured wells have been modeled with an analytical model for unsteadystate flow with fines migration. The simulation results and the field data indicated a good match, within 5%. A sensitivity study conducted on initial concentration of fines, flow rate, maximum finesmobilization velocity, fines distribution, formation damage, and filtration coefficients confirmed that the model-matching parameters are within values reported commonly in the literature. This paper describes the methodology used to integrate the modeling predictions with field and laboratory data to identify probable causes for increasing skins and declining productivity-index values observed in some of the wells under investigation. It discusses the results of an experiment designed to simultaneously assess the effects of pressure depletion and compaction on fines production and permeability with a triaxial-stress apparatus. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time an experiment of this nature is reported in the literature. The good match between the modeling and the field data, further validated with laboratory experiments, allows for discussion of long-term predictions on well productivity impacting current reservoir-management strategies and field-development plans.|","fines migration"

Gravitational monitoring physical precondition is considerately important for possibility to improve the process of underground gas storage exploitation. Also gravity monitoring method can help in understanding of natural gas flows in crosswell space as a response on injection-extraction process.
Introduction
The volume of commercial feed of natural gas to consumers has a seasonal nature with the decrease in the summer and significant increase in winter. Taking into account that natural gas production is almost constant in time, scheme of natural gas supply from the wellhead to consumer includes underground gas storage (UGS) facilities, used to inject excess volumes in summer and to cover increased gas use in winter. So operation of underground gas storage consists in seasonal extractions and injections of natural gas. For each UGS technical features including maximum amount of gas in UGS and reservoir pressure are calculated and approved during its projecting. Considering heterogeneity of gas-saturated reservoirs there is a problem of operational control of processes that take place in UGS. First of all it regards the structure of active UGS zone, paths of gas filtration and stagnant zones detection. Hydrodynamic pressure studies in UGS are commonly performed which are based on pressure observation used to solve filtering problem in porous environment. Also methods of distant geophysical control play important role. Among distant geophysical methods of geological environment monitoring 4D seismics is a primary tool. The results of 4D seismic application are described in a large number of publications (Lumley, 2010). However, seismic monitoring is not always effective either because of geological or economic conditions. Between other geophysical methods used for monitoring we can distinguish gravimetric method that is associated with a control of density variation. Another group includes electrical methods, which are widely used recently in exploration process for oil and gas. Today, there are examples of successful application of gravity monitoring for study of volcanic activity, control of groundwater propagation direction, storage and extraction of artificial aquifers, as well as the development of hydrocarbon deposits (Davis, K., Li, Y., Batzle, M., Raynolds, B., 2010). However, the issue of the usage gravity method for monitoring of underground gas storage is still under investigated. Therefore, this abstract deals with physical precondition for gravity application, expected gravity anomalies amplitudes, as well as hindering factors.|","4D, density, pore pressure, monitoring, gravimeter"

Geopressure (or overpressure) presents significant risks to drilling if not predicted accurately. To better understand mechanisms of abnormal fluid pressure, I choose an inclusion-based micromechanical model by using the concept of eigenstrain and characterize the microstructure of rocks as a product of the compaction processes. Analysis and numerical tests demonstrate that fluid pressure and effective velocities are functions of the microstructure (e.g., shape of inclusions) and the stress state of the rock, which suggests the possibility of linking pressure and velocities to geological parameters.|","rock physics, tensor, porosity, pore pressure, velocity"

Natural joint structures in layered rock provide an analog for interpreting patterns of hydraulic-fracture microseismicity often observed in unconventional gas reservoir. We interpret systematic patterns of source locations and mechanisms in terms of fringe cracks and bedding-plane slip as the hydraulic fracture encounters layer interfaces. In this sense the microseismicity provides a direct picture of tensile fracture growth through a reservoir, highlighting the deformation at and near bedding boundaries as the hydraulic fracture rips through or along layer interfaces.

Wide-azimuth, long-offset seismic data allow estimating azimuthal anisotropy and direction resulting from the presence of natural fractures and anisotropic in-situ stress. This can be done by measuring how seismic velocities and amplitudes vary as a function of the offset and azimuth associated with the seismic reflection data. Rock intrinsic properties like anisotropy, azimuth of fast and slow directions, fracture density, and total porosity, as well as the in-situ principal stress components, can be inferred and used to help with well design, placement and completion strategies.
Recent advances in seismic azimuthal analysis of media with orthotropic symmetry (an orthotropic medium has three orthogonal planes of mirror symmetry), and quantitative interpretation workflows, are illustrated using high-resolution prestack seismic inversion in an unconventional play in the Williston basin in North America. The algorithm, valid for orthotropic symmetry, was first tested on synthetic data, and then applied to real world wide-azimuth 3D data. Results indicate that amplitude versus azimuth (AVAz) analysis of wide-azimuth seismic measurements for orthotropic media, can be used to estimate anisotropy, principle directions, and to constrain the orientation and magnitude of the principal in-situ stresses.
In addition, the middle Bakken member can be fully resolved seismically through the application of a suitable, high fidelity, inversion algorithm to the azimuthal seismic data. This allows characterization of the middle Bakken member in 3D in terms of thickness, porosity and fracture density, as well as elastic and rock strength parameters. With the implementation of a suitable rock physics model, the inversion results can be used to estimate high-resolution fracture density and total porosity 3D volumes, and the orientation and magnitude of the principal components of the in-situ stress tensor.|","AVO/AVA, unconventional, invasion"

A Life of Field Seismic (LoFS) permanent seabed seismic system has been installed and operating at the Ekofisk field since 2008. High quality active source seismic and passive seismic data have been recorded in the field and effectively used for management of the reservoir and overburden. In this paper we demonstrate how horizontally propagating surface waves from active source seismic data allow us to estimate near surface seismic velocities and associated anisotropy. We also show how the observed time dependent velocity changes are empirically associated with strain and stress changes from production induced subsidence. We base our analysis on Scholte waves, which are dispersive surface waves that propagate horizontally under the seabed, and critically refracted compressional (CRC) waves, which are P-waves that propagate horizontally along the seabed starting with the critical offset. The results indicate that the average seismic velocity is related to the expected principal stress magnitude, and seismic anisotropy is related to stress change preferential directions.|","anisotropy, case history, head waves, surface wave"

In this case study we present the results from a time-lapse (4D) feasibility study that includes analysis of core data and reservoir simulator to seismic modeling to predict time-lapse seismic response from dynamic reservoir model from the Mad Dog field.
Ultrasonic velocities (UVs) for both P and S waves were obtained from nine axially oriented sandstone core plug samples. These experiments were conducted under uniaxial strain conditions, in which radial strain was kept constant. The samples were cleaned, dried and then subjected to multiple loading and unloading cycles designed to simulate reservoir stress conditions of pressure depletion and build-up due to production and water injection. Travel times were obtained by careful picking of first arrival events on P and S full waveforms. These picks were used to compute P and S velocities, which were then used together with density data to compute dynamic bulk and shear moduli. These core data were then used to characterize the sensitivity of the dry rock frame to changes in effective stress. Sensitivity of porosity to changes in effective stress was also characterized.
Dry frame moduli were obtained from sonic log measurements using Gassmann fluid substitution for comparison with core data. Computed dry frame moduli from logs show close agreement with the core measurements. This comparison provides more confidence in the laboratory core measurements with less likelihood of core damage. Moreover, we could estimate the effective stress coefficient by matching the dry frame bulk moduli from cores to logs.
Next the core dry frame parameters were used to model rock properties changes in the reservoir for a single interface. Finally, full-field time-lapse feasibility study with the 3D reservoir simulation model was done to model the expected time-lapse response of the Mad Dog field. Results from the feasibility study show that the model-based time-lapse signal could be observed in extra-salt reservoirs using a time-lapse noise threshold derived from time-lapse ocean bottom nodes data from analog fields.
The core analysis and time-lapse feasibility studies demonstrate the need to integrate field-based core measurements to predict time-lapse signal in deepwater reservoirs under complex overburden.|","time-lapse, rock physics, deepwater, case history, 4D"

The main considerations for well plan and hydraulic fracturing in the conventional plays include 1) the amount of total organic carbon (TOC) and 2) how much hydrocarbon can be extracted. Brittleness is the direct measurement of a formation about the ability to create avenues for hydrocarbons when suffering to hydraulic fracturing. Usually Brittleness is estimated from 1) laboratory stress-strain measurements 2) rock properties and 3) mineral contents analysis using well logs. However well log based brittleness only shows the properties near the borehole when the amount of wells or log type is limited, resulting a two dimensional result. In this paper, we proposed a workflow to estimate brittleness of shale plays in three dimension at seismic scale by integrating the rock properties from petrophysics and seismic analysis. The workflow begins by brittleness evaluation using well logs at the borehole location. Then we prestack invert the fidelity preserved seismic gather to generate rock property volumes. At last we integrate brittleness estimation from seismic and petrophysics analysis where the petrophysics result serves as the bench mark. We apply our workflow to a survey acquired over Fort Worth Basin, TX, USA where eight wells locate in this survey.

Conventional hydrocarbons reserves in the USA have gradually been reduced, and with the rising of oil prices, the sight of energy companies is on unconventional reservoirs. The Barnett shale is one of the most important unconventional reservoirs in the USA. It has been a challenge in unconventional reservoirs to find the petrophysical properties which can be used as a proxy to TOC. Current explorers are using GR and Density porosity as a proxy in Unconventional reservoirs. 
In Barnett Shale gamma ray plays a significant role. In this unconventional reservoir, when the shale has higher content of quartz the gamma ray values are low. The higher percentage of quartz makes it more brittle. Whereas, when the organic content, which occur with radioactive material is high, the gamma ray values are high. In shales including Woodford and Eagleford, the density of the shales decreases when the TOC is high in the shale. Here, we have tried to estimate these properties in 3D volumes, as well as correlate it to production.

We present a new method to determine moment tensors using surface microseismic imaging. The method involves the projection of data onto each moment tensor component, and using the amplitudes at the source origin time and location as an estimate of the seismic moment tensor. The procedure combines both precise source location and source characterization, and is known as Moment Tensor Microseismic Imaging (MTMI) (Chambers et al., in press). We compare the moment tensor results obtained using this method with those from a standard least squares inversion. We investigate the relative performance of the two approaches using synthetic data computed for two commonly observed microseismic source types, and a variety of signal to noise ratios (SNRs).

Petroleum production and CO2 storage induce effective stress changes and deformations in the reservoir, as well as in the overburden. This may be detected by 4D seismic monitoring due to the stress-sensitivity of the seismic velocities in the rocks. Here we address how stiffness contrast between the reservoir rock and the overburden, reservoir inclination, and overburden rock anisotropy may affect changes in two-way seismic travel time, based on laboratory measured stress-sensitivity of wave velocities in rock specimens and field scale geomechanical modeling.
Introduction
Pore pressure changes caused by reservoir depletion or inflation by fluid injection lead to stress changes within the reservoir and in the surrounding rocks. Resulting effective stress changes will alter the seismic properties of the rocks involved (Hornby, 1998; Sayers, 2002; Prioul et al., 2004; Ciz & Shapiro, 2009). This makes time lapse seismic an important tool to monitor subsurface alterations (e.g., Landro 2001) and thereby improving recovery or storage capacity by optimal placement of new wells. Since seismic waves propagate twice through usually very thick overburden, overburden changes become significant and have to be understood in order to properly interpret 4D seismic data (Kenter et al., 2004; Hatchell & Bourne, 2005; Fj<U+00E6>r & Kristiansen, 2009; Herwanger & Home, 2009).
Subsurface stress alterations induced by pore pressure changes are primarily related to the geometry (shape and orientation) of the depleted / inflated volume, and to rock mechanical properties of the reservoir and its surroundings. In this work we address how elastic contrast in stiffness between the reservoir rock and the overburden, rock anisotropy, and the inclination of the reservoir influence the stress changes, and furthermore how the seismic two-way travel time (TWT) is influenced. Additional influence associated with rock heterogeneity and non-elastic effects (plastic deformation, faulting / fault reactivation) is not considered in this paper.|","anisotropy, monitoring, rock physics, finite element"

In recent years, many efforts have been dedicated to improving the imaging of complex subsurface structures. Alongside better velocity models, more accurate migration algorithms and multiple attenuation techniques, new wide-azimuth seismic acquisition schemes aim at improving our ability to image steeply dipping and overhanging salt-bodies, as well as sub-salt reflectors. These applications have converged towards the joint application of wide azimuthal ray-coverage and imaging algorithms running on anisotropic velocity models (Zdraveva et al., 2012). As the complexity of the velocity model increases, so does the task of attaining all parameters involved in describing such a model, and due to the intrinsic limitations of the imaging process, this cannot be achieved by velocity analysis of appropriate seismic gathers alone.
Expanding the work of Sengupta, et al. (2008, 2009) and Bachrach, et al. (2008), we aim at incorporating additional constraints into velocity models, which arise from the expected geomechanical conditions for subsurface sediments lying in the vicinity of salt bodies. These are not incorporated a priori, but by simulating and solving for the particular geomechanical characteristics of their natural settings and the manner in which these would imprint themselves over the velocity field. Ultimately, this process should result in improved images of salt flanks and sub-salt reflectors, as well as increase the fidelity of seismic amplitudes. In this paper, we take a first step in this direction and show that geomechanically-derived orthorhombic velocity predictions are consistent with wide-azimuth anisotropic seismic data observations in the Gulf of Mexico.|","Gulf of Mexico, velocity, finite element, anisotropy, rock physics"

In order to improve our understanding of the interaction of the hydraulic fracture with pre-existing structures in reservoirs, we focused on separating microseismicity related to the hydraulic fracture propagation and microseismicity occurring along the pre-existing structures. We analyzed microseismic activity detected during the stimulation job in a horizontal well with ten stages. The microseismicity aligns in two major trends, E-W and NE-SW. The microseismicity in the NE-SW trend is aligned with the maximum horizontal stress and is related to the hydraulic fracture propagation. The E-W trend is related to the interaction of the hydraulic fracture with the pre-existing structures in the area. Some stimulated stages show very clear and distinguished spatial separation of microseismicity related to the two trends while some stages have more complex pattern. We combine several techniques that help to distinguish various types of seismicity: data set separation, geomechanical, magnitude-frequency, and well pressure analyses.  The synthesis of the various methods helps to improve our understanding of the well stimulation. Overall, we almost doubled the number of hydrofractures and fault/fracture zones in comparison to the original interpretation based only on the microseismic mapping and we better constrained the half-lengths of the hydraulic fractures. The detailed data analysis strongly suggests that some hydraulic fractures may be aseismic. 
Introduction 
The intersection of the pre-existing fractures during the well stimulation can cause fluid loss into the fracture and therefore unnecessary cost. Depending on the local situation, the leak of fluid along the pre-existing structures can also cause an environmental harm. In terms of production, pre-existing fractures can act as a conductive zone. 
We analyze microseismic activity detected during the stimulation job in a horizontal well containing ten stages. The microseismicity aligns in two major trends, E-W and NE-SW (Figure 1). Only some stages show clear development of the hydraulic fracture when other stages are at least partially aseismic (in a sense not detected by a surface array). In some stages, microseismic activity increases towards the end of pumping and continues strongly afterwards (Figure 2). The questions related to this data set are summarized as: 
The two main microseismic trends seem to be related to two different processes: the hydrofracture propagation and the reactivation of the pre-existing fractures. Can we separate microseismicity related to the two processes? The hydraulic fracture will most likely propagate in the different direction than is the orientation of pre-existing faults/fractures. Does the separation help to determine the length of the hydraulic fracture? |Are the aseismic areas an aseismic hydraulic fracture or an unstimulated area? |Why each stage has different microseismic activity? Is it due to the local conditions? |Why is microseismicity recorded mainly towards the end and after the end of pumping? 
Microseismic data sets are often very complex and difficult to understand. This is due to the fact that the stress field is varying in the reservoir during the reservoir stimulation and that the reservoir is heterogeneous. These conditions change from reservoir to reservoir and even from well to well causing thus that the microseismic data sets are often incomparable.  Very often, however, a complex microseismic data set is attempted to be interpreted as a single physical process or in a statistical manner. We would like to make a point that it is important to understand the data set and to separate microseismic data related to either different physical process prior the interpretation.|","hydraulic fracturing, microseismic, faults"

Some of these assets have been producing for 30 to 40 years or more, which is typically beyond the design life, and have reached a water to oil ratio of 3 to 9 or more. There are many issues that affect the productivity and economic viability of these fields. Some of the challenges include integrity uncertainty in the wells, flow lines, and facilities; production bottlenecks due to the shift in gas, oil and water ratios; erosion/corrosion; increased sand production and handling costs; high chemical consumption and treatment costs; and obsolete monitoring and control systems that are incompatible with new technologies and which contribute to the need for a large number of operations staff. Generally operators are faced with the commercial decision whether to sell the asset to a low cost operator, reinvest in the asset, or incur the cost of decommissioning. |While the number and complexity of these challenges are significant, there are nevertheless a number of viable options for extending the economic life of such assets. Hydrocarbon recovery and production from these fields can be enhanced by infill drilling; acid and fracture stimulation; by implementing a range of remediation techniques such as recompletion with smart systems to reduce water and solids influx to surface facilities; and by the implementation of improved and enhanced recovery methods. Selecting the optimal strategy requires a holistic perspective on subsurface issues, wells, and surface facilities, and an ability to make projections of integrated performance. This is greatly facilitated by first developing a root cause understanding of the reservoir and production fluid characteristics, and second, the use of analysis tools that allow quick and reasonably accurate assessment of options. |In order to increase value from matured fields, the goal is to increase oil recovery from the historical average of 35% and to optimize production by improving the operational efficiency. To achieve this goal, in this paper we will put forward two key imperatives that extend the life of a mature field: (1) Finding and accessing the by-passed oil and (2) Maintaining High uptime during Asset production and operation. |In this paper, several mature fields in Europe, Far East and Middle East are analyzed and presented in order to: |highlight the root causes for either low production and or higher operating costs; |assess the impact of both surface and subsurface uncertainties in multiple development planning scenarios; |develop the best strategies and options for improved reservoir, well and facilities management;   |demonstrate the contributions of implemented new technologies that optimized performance of artificial lift, minimized downtime by well intervention and reduced operational costs by fluids flow assurance in well and surface facilities; and   |list the technical and economical challenges that still face the industry.","IOR EOR, Mature asset, Lifecycle, water management, Facilities"

Most laboratory investigations suggest that decrease in reservoir pressure would lead to great loss of fracture conductivity and rapid production decline. But till today, no such evidence from the production practices has been documented; on the contrary, there are some reported cases where depletion could potentially maintain even increase the extraction rate. |To solve the discrepancy, experiments were performed when permeability of fractured cores was measured in the process of increasing confining pressure with a constant pore pressure. In production, formation overburden pressure represented by laboratory confining pressure seldom alters and it is the pore pressure that virtually changes. To cope with that, effective stress was applied in the study, where Biots coefficient for fracture effective stress was theoretically derived and found equal to fracture porosity. Improved evaluation method was then given based on effective stress and stress-dependent permeability correlations. At last, a general evaluation criterion was established where stress sensitivity levels were classified based on Stress-sensitivity Index. |The evaluation of four cores reveals that, the stress-dependence of fracture permeability turns out to be weak if evaluated with a low value of Biots coefficient directly resulting from small fracture porosity. The study also indicates that fracture is strongly sensitive to confining pressure change in laboratory, but only weakly sensitive to the reservoir pressure change in production, which might reconcile the discrepancy between laboratory study and production practice.|","Document Type

In the first part, we report the results of comparative imbibition experiments on several binary core plugs from the Montney tight gas formation, which is an enormous tight gas fairway in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Both contact angle and imbibition data indicate that the formation is strongly oil-wet. However, the ratio between oil and water imbibition rate of these samples is higher than what capillary-driven imbibition models predict. This discrepancy can be explained by the strong adsorption of oil on the surface of a well-connected organic pore network that is partly coated by pyrobitumen. We also define a wettability index by using the equilibrium imbibed volume of oil and water in binary plugs. Oil wettability index is in general positively correlated to the total organic carbon (TOC), measured by the Rock-Eval technique. In the second part, we report similar imbibition experiments on several binary core samples collected from the cores drilled in the shale members of the Horn River Basin. In contrast to the Montney (MT) samples, the Horn River (HR) samples imbibe significantly more water than oil. This observation contradicts the contact angle results which suggest that the HR samples are strongly oil-wet. Clay hydration, imbibition-induced microfractures, depositional lamination, and osmotic potential are collectively responsible for the excess water uptake. We also measure and compare spontaneous imbibition of oil and water into the crushed packs of the similar HR samples. Interestingly, in contrast to the intact samples, the crushed samples consistently imbibe more oil than water. The comparative study suggests that the connected pore network of the intact HR samples is water-wet while the majority of rock including poorly connected pores is oil-wet.Overall, the results suggest that the well-connected pore network of the MT samples is dominantly hydrophobic and is very likely to be coated by pyrobitumen. This is the main reason why these samples imbibe more oil than water. On the other hand, the well-connected pore network of the HR samples is strongly hydrophilic primarily due to the presence of clay minerals and precipitated salt crystals coating the rock grains. |Introduction |Increasing the energy demand has shifted the industry focus towards unconventional resources worldwide. Recent advances in horizontal drilling and multi-lateral/multi-stage hydraulic fracturing has unlocked the challenging unconventional resources. However, successful and sustainable development of such reservoirs requires correct characterization of reservoir properties (Burke et al., 2011). In particular, knowing the reservoir rock properties such as permeability, porosity and wettability (wetting affinity) is critical for reserve estimation, production forecasting and designing optimum fracturing and treatment fluids. |The affinity of a reservoir rock on a particular fluid is defined as wettability, which depends on various factors such as rock mineralogy and the properties of the materials coating the rock surface (Anderson, 1986; Rao et al., 1994; Hamon, 2000; Mohammed B et al., 2010; Mohammadlou et al., 2012). Characterizing the wettability of reservoir rocks is important for 1) selecting fracturing and treatment fluids, 2) investigating residual phase saturation and its pore-scale topology, 3) investigating the occurrence water blockage at fracture face, and 4) selecting relevant capillary pressure and relative permeability models for reservoir engineering calculations.|","Tight Gas, Capillary Pressure, Wettability, Shale Gas, Imbibition"

Fracturing technology has been applied to offshore deviated wells, sand control wells, tight gas, coal, chalks, shales and conglomerates in turn as conventional reservoir limits were reached and each new unconventional reservoir was encountered. As fracturing technology was adapted to make an unconventional reservoir into a conventional reservoir, the adaptations and evolutions needed became part of the technology tool box waiting for the next challenge. Each innovation improved and stretched the reach of completions and production engineering as new findings were incorporated to monitor, model, optimize and extend the ranges of fracturing use for high and low temperatures, high stress formations and a variety of other challenges. |This review looks at the development of multi-fractured wells from its first application in vertical wells where one well could now do the task of three wells, to the first modern application of highly multi-fractured horizontal wells used in chalks, shales and tight oil and gas reservoirs. The technical focus is on the learning procession covering details of casing wear, cyclic pressure application, isolation mechanisms, perforation placement, well spacing and fracture spacing. |The technical literature and field learnings have both been searched for applicable information with a surprising variety of engineering application details brought forth that are useful in optimizing a single well or a whole development. |Introduction |Beginning with the first multiple fractured vertical wells in 1952, two years after hydraulic fracturing was commercialized, multiple fracturing found a home in vertical wells and was soon common both in on-shore and off-shore wells where the geologic basins contained stacked or thick pay zones (Clark & Fast, 1952; Neill, et.al., 1957; Kruger, 1973; Strubhar et.al., 1974; Strubhar & Glenn, 1974, Montgomery & Smith, 2010).  Ever since the advancements of hydraulic fracturing provided two to over ten times the production possible in an unfractured well, the wellbore, be it vertical, deviated or horizontal, has been widely viewed as a platform for hydraulic fracture stimulation delivery (Coulter, 1976; Austin, et.al., 2009; Al-Shamma, et.al., 2014).|","Unconventional, Multi-Fractured, Deviated, Vertical, Horizontal Completion"

However, there are not many publications in literature relating water production increasing with fault reactivation caused by depletion. The unexpected water production by fault reactivation related to depletion, promotes a huge impact on an oil field production, reducing the reservoir drainage efficiency and causing premature aging of operating plants, in some cases generating production bottlenecks due to produced water treatment limitations. |This paper presents parameters that influence fault reactivation mechanism and their importance in early water production. |In order to evaluate the phenomenon, a failure stability parameter that can be monitored during reservoir production time life is proposed and its behavior can be analyzed by comparison with produced water rate. The methodology is based on Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion using a simplified approach. |Basically, the method considers the change in the state of effective stresses, vertical and horizontal, during production and its ratio (<U+03C3>h/<U+03C3>v) called K0.The relationship of effective stress necessary for the Mohr circle touches the envelope of rupture for a given frictional angle, called K1, is also considered. |Thus, it is possible to observe the stress state changing as field production occurs using flow simulation. Fault reactivation analysis is obtained from the difference K0 minus K1, being K0 less or equal to K1, the condition at which depletion can   induce faults in the reservoir. The method has been successfully applied on an unconsolidated sandstone reservoir from Campos Basin, explaining the evolution of anomalies in BSW (basic sediment and water) values that could not be predicted ignoring the theory of fault reactivation by depletion. |Recognizing that fault reactivations contribute to the unexpected water production is an important changing of paradigm in oil industry. The determination of the parameter of reactivation by depletion constitutes an important mark to indicate the right moment for beginning waterflooding. Many mature fields that present high Water Cut values, previously thought to have occurred due to rising of water-oil contact, may be revisited and restudied using the theory of fault reactivation by depletion. The approach can help to identify undrained-overlooked areas where infill drilling projects could be implemented, extending oil production and increasing oil recovery factors.|","geomechanics, Depletion, Early Water Production, sandstones, Fault reactivation"

The degree of brittleness in shale reservoirs is determined upon the basis of its mineralogical composition, which can be obtained from mineralogical logging tools (such as ECSTM, FLeXTM, GEMTM, Litho ScannerTM), or XRD tests in the laboratory. Generally, measurements of mineralogical brittleness are obtained from physical sources and lead to relatively reliable interpretation results. However, mineralogical logging is expensive and not commonly available in the shale play. Alternatively, brittleness can also be calculated from dynamic Youngs modulus and Poissons ratio, but the absence of shear slowness in some wells restricts its wide application. Internal friction angle based brittleness can give similar interpretation results as the preceding two methods, but its accuracy depends highly on the quality of correlations. It is observed that the curves of the three different brittlenesses demonstrate similar shapes. Therefore, we have attempted to build correlations between mineralogical brittleness and porosity or sonic compressional slowness for typical shale plays (Woodford, Barnett, and Eagle Ford shale), and have proven their validity with the data obtained from wells not included in the development of correlations. Applications of these findings include: (1) enabling the possibility of evaluating brittleness in plays lacking mineralogical and shear sonic loggings, thus reducing the quantity of laboratory testing, (2) inspiring operators to develop in-house correlations of brittleness for shale gas plays, and (3) investigating similar correlations in emerging unconventional oil plays, such as Granite Wash. |Keywords: Brittleness; Unconventional shale; Hydraulic fracturing; Elemental logging; Tight oil.|","Brittleness, Tight oil, Unconventional shale, Elemental logging, Hydraulic fracturing"

Based upon insight from the study, the operator needed to make more informed asset management decisions, understand the interaction between the shale and the hydraulic fracture network, and improve economics. Data were captured from several wells, both vertical and horizontal. The data incorporated into the study included fieldwide seismic data, as well as mineralogical, geomechanical, well plan, drilling, completion, microseismic monitoring, and production data from the wells.       |The project comprised one case history involving the hydraulic fracture stimulation treatment of a cluster of horizontal wells. Microseismic hydraulic fracture monitoring (HFM) was utilized to track the development of the hydraulic fractures in real time as they propagated throughout the formation. The stimulation activity from the well was monitored from a horizontal array placed in a horizontal lateral drilled parallel to the target well but landed ~ 80 m shallower in the vertical section. |An integrated unconventional-reservoir-specific workflow was utilized to develop and evaluate the completion strategies for the subject well.  First, a fieldwide 3D static geologic model was constructed using the aforementioned data to determine the best reservoir and completion qualities of the Vaca Muerta formation. Next, the model was used to develop the completion strategy, including staging, perforation scheme, stimulation design, etc., for the wells. The completion strategy and stimulation design were performed utilizing an automated, rigorous, and efficient multistaging algorithm (completion advisor). This enabled targeting the reservoir section having the best reservoir and completion qualities for the stimulation treatments. The stimulation designs were performed using a state-of-the-art unconventional hydraulic fracture simulator that properly simulates the complex fracture propagation in shale reservoirs, including the explicit interaction of the hydraulic fractures to the pre-existing natural fissures in the formation and performs automatic gridding of the created complex fractures to rigorously model the production response from the tridimensional fracture network. |A comparison between the microseismic fracture geometry to the planned fracture geometry is revealing; it shows that the application of this new technology can identify some of the complications and challenges involved in the process of fracturing a rock, improve the success of stimulation treatments, and identify opportunities to improve operational efficiency. |The calibrated complex hydraulic fracture simulation results were incorporated into a shale-oil, numerical simulator and further calibrated with current production history of the well. The results of the fracture and reservoir models were utilized to understand the fracture propagation mechanism in the Vaca Muerta shale formation. |As a result of the project, the team is now able to run different scenarios and assess the impact that each key parameter has over the well<U+00B4>s estimated ultimate recovery.

The methods available for interpretation of pressure-pulse decay tests are reviewed with emphasis on the difference between the intrinsic and apparent permeability. Improved formulation and analysis which honor the relevant physics of gas transport and interactions of flowing gas with the shale under the pore-proximity and elevated pressure conditions are presented. Modification of the shale and fluid properties under prevailing stress, and pore-size distribution, connectivity, and confinement conditions is shown to be important under any pressure conditions while the gas rarefaction and slippage effects diminish essentially at high pressures but become important at low pressures. The permeability and other parameters of shale samples are determined by numerical modeling and analysis of the pressure tests conducted under different conditions in order to accommodate for temporally and spatially variable conditions. Better design and analysis of experiments for simultaneous determination of several unknown parameters that impact transport calculations, including stress-deformation, adsorption, diffusion, and deviation from Darcy flow are described. The inherent limitations of the earlier methods which rely on the approximate analytical solutions of the simplified diffusivity equation based on the Darcys law are delineated. It is pointed out that the permeability measured using a Darcy-type equation is the apparent permeability and not the intrinsic permeability. Thus, the primary reason for the contradictory values of permeability measured by application of the analytical models is explained by dependence of the permeability of shale to different testing conditions over which only different average permeability values can be obtained when applying the approximate analytical solutions obtained based on the assumption of a constant permeability value. |Introduction |Permeability cannot be measured directly; rather it is inferred by interpretation of experimental data using appropriate models. For this purpose, some experimental pressure and sometimes flow data are generated by inducing gas transport through porous materials and then the permeability is determined by adjusting a set of model parameters to match the measured data. Laboratory measurements need to be sufficiently representative of the in-situ conditions or alternatively, interpretation models (such as provided by Civan et al., 2011, 2012) need to provide the means to correct for any deviations or errors. Laboratory permeability measurements can be acquired using core plugs, drill cuttings, or crushed samples. A typical measurement method is transient-state pressure-pulse transmission. Permeability values obtained in this way depend on the measurement conditions and data interpretation methods and therefore the measurements of permeability reported by various laboratories may not necessarily agree. |","Transmission Tests, Gas-Permeability, Crushed Samples, Shale-Matrix, Pressure-Pulse"

Organic matter is an important component of shale oil and gas resource plays and can have a profound effect on the properties of shale. Porosity in the organic matter provides potential storage for hydrocarbons, and depending on the connectivity of the organic matter, possible connected pathways for hydrocarbon flow.  In addition, from a completions and seismic mapping perspective, the distribution of organic matter will affect the elastic properties of shale as well as the elastic anisotropy.  Because of the heterogeneity of shales and micron to sub- micron size of the organic matter, mapping changes in organic distribution with sufficient resolution to capture a statistically meaningful sample of the organic matter has proven difficult.  Previous work has used a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM), x-ray computed tomography (XCT), or optical thin sections to map the distribution of organic matter. All these techniques have limitations in the sense that they either provide large area mapping at low resolution or small area mapping at high resolution but not large areas with high resolution.  With the advent of large area ion beam milling and automated high-resolution SEM imaging and stitching, a seven order of magnitude size range can now be spanned allowing the distribution of organic matter over centimeter square areas to be mapped with nanometer resolution.  Utilizing this technique, the distribution and connectivity of organic matter over extended contiguous sections of core from the Barnett and Wolfcamp Shales were mapped at one inch intervals.  Variations in total organic content between cores and within the same core were measured in the lab, and these variations are compared to the SEM results.  In addition, the shape and orientation of the organic matter was analyzed.  These measurements aid in placing limits on the scale of variation in organic matter distribution in shale and represent the first crucial step in attempting to upscale SEM data to core petrophysical measurements and potentially to log-scale measurements.|","Upscaling, Shale, Organic Matter Distribution, SEM"

Due to their low permeability, hydraulic fracturing is necessary for economic production in these shale systems. The success of these reservoirs is dependent on optimized hydraulic fracturing designs, and requires an understanding of the mechanical properties of these reservoirs. |One of these properties, Youngs modulus, can weaken the formation if it is reduced. This weakening of the formation can, in turn, lead to; increased proppant embedment into the fracture face and a subsequent loss of conductivity. In low permeability shale reservoirs, the conductivity achieved through fracturing is just as critical as in other formations, thus making proppant embedment an issue that needs to be fully understood. This paper focused on how different fracturing fluids impacted the Youngs modulus of the Niobrara shale, a major producing formation in the states of Colorado and Wyoming, and how this change affects proppant embedment and conductivity with certain proppants. |Nanoindentation technology was used to determine Youngs modulus changes in Niobrara core samples after they were saturated for 30 days in certain fracturing fluids, and after they were heated under temperature (180°F) for five days. Treated samples were then subjected to high pressure (3030 psi) with selected proppants, simulating a fracture to test the proppant embedment profiles using scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) and profilometer measurements. |The experimental results showed that Youngs modulus decreased with fluid exposure regardless of the fracturing fluid type and also increased (rebounded) after a certain saturation time. The magnitude of decrease in Youngs modulus values was dependent on fluid type and saturation time. In one extreme case, (when KCl+friction reducer fluid was used as treatment fluid for 30 days) Youngs modulus decreased by approximately 80%. The Youngs modulus reduction is believed to be mainly caused by a weakening of the calcite minerals. Higher reductions experienced by KCl based fluids could be due to a detrimental chemical reaction between KCl and calcite minerals. Results also showed proppant embedment and crushing are inevitable under the tested circumstances and are dependent on distributed stress on the contact points as well as proppant type and fluid exposure. |Introduction |Over the last few decades, natural gas and oil production from unconventional shale systems has increased significantly. These reservoirs are essential parts of the present and future of the oil and gas industry. Throughout the last 40 years, the petroleum industry has progressed from conventional gas reservoirs, to tight gas reservoirs, to ultra-low matrix permeability unconventional shale-gas reservoirs (Kundert and Mullen, 2009). Shale reservoirs are becoming increasingly important day-by-day due to the production success and abundance of reserves. The Energy Information Agency has shale resource estimates of 335 billion bbl of oil and 7,795 tcf of gas for the world and 58 billion bbl of oil and 665 tcf of gas for the United States (Energy Information Agency, 2013). The significance of these numbers, and with conventional reservoirs depleting, unconventional reservoirs across the globe will have to supply the world with energy and meet the high demands of hydrocarbon usage.

Anisotropy is evaluated using measurements at various scales: at the pore scale by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), at the lamination scale by compressional velocity scanning and x-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging and at the core scale via static/dynamic measurements on both 1-inch and 3-inch diameter cores. Finally, correlations from core data are applied to sonic log interpretation to improve the estimation of minimum horizontal stress in a vertical transverse isotropic media. |Three sets of horizontal and vertical 3-inch core samples were prepared from conventional cores in the light oil-bearing section of the lower Eagle Ford shale. Compressional velocities were measured every 0.5 mm to examine vertical heterogeneity at the lamination scale on 3-inch horizontal cores. In one of the samples, frequent thin layers with higher velocity (+15%) were detected. The high velocity layers correspond to foraminifera rich layers detected in the SEM analysis. These layers are source of vertical heterogeneity which can affect the anisotropic analysis. |Dynamic testing on the 3-inch cores was conducted followed by dynamic testing on 1-inch plugs (horizontal, vertical and 45°) drilled from each of the 3-inch cores and a comparative study between the 1-inch anisotropic results with their 3-inch counterparts was conducted. Shear and compressive anisotropy was similar between the 3-inch and 1-inch samples detected homogenous by velocity scanning.

Current industry methods, such as high resolution resistivity imaging, mitigate uncertainties in fracture characterization, but are not cost effective or always available. Conventional well logs (e.g., induction logs) can be better solutions for the industry for reliable fracture characterization. However, these measurements do not provide significant sensitivity to fracture location and geometry. An improved evaluation of thickness and near-wellbore geometry of induced fractures using conventional well logging tools could significantly enhance operational decisions and increase production during field development. |We propose the use of surface gas readings and downhole measurements in combination with numerical simulations of electromagnetic induction log responses to define and high-grade natural fracture corridors. We performed numerical simulations to model the effects of hydraulic fractures on induction log response, within the fractured zones. These simulations consisted of placing resistive fractures, with variable parameters, inside a layered formation, and modeling the apparent resistivity using an induction logging simulator. The fractured zones were represented using a geologic roughening parameter, <U+03B2>, while the simulator is based on the finite element method. The simulator, Seatem, solves the diffusive Maxwell equations, and plots the resulting apparent resistivity distributions within an unstructured tetrahedral mesh. This provides us with a good understanding of how the targeted zone interacts with different stimulation factors. |We successfully performed numerical simulations along a multi-zoned reservoir interval for three synthetic cases: a sandstone formation, a carbonate formation, and an organic shale formation. We quantified the effects of hydraulic fracturing on induction logs and optimized placement of fracture treatments on synthetic cases. The results of this paper indicate fractured zones with beta values larger than 0.3, viable for fracture corridor depletion and geologic targeting, can be identified from induction log responses. |Introduction |Unconventional reservoirs hold significant hydrocarbon reserves that are often unobtainable through classical production techniques. These types of formations contain unique geological properties that require enhanced recovery methods to make their production economically feasible. The standard method of producing these reservoirs involves stimulation of the rock matrix through various fracturing techniques. |Although individual wells in unconventional formations have a relatively low cost for drilling and completions, they typically have a budget that limits the operators ability to analyze sufficiently crucial geomechanical parameters, such as natural fracture density. Even in the best cases, uncertainty in subsurface characterization is still prevalent among unconventional reservoirs. In larger investment wells, specialized techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, high-definition resistivity imaging, and production logs may solve many of these characterization issues. However, in unconventional plays, the operator is often forced to rely on basic geomechanical and well logging methods to extract fracture attributes.|","Electromagnetic Diffusion, Fractures, Induction Logs, Numerical simulation"

To fully characterize the elastic anisotropy of a transversely isotropic rock, five independent elastic constants are required. In the laboratory, this tranditionally translates to measuring the wave velocities on at least three separate adjacent core plugs with various orientations - one parallel, one perpendicular, and one at 45° to the bedding. However, it is difficult to drill multiple adjacent core plugs with good quality from a whole core of gas shale because of its weakness and brittleness. |This paper presents a simpler, alternative technical lab procedure of characterizing the elastic anisotropy of transversely isotropic rocks from one horizontal core plug only. The plug is cut parallel to the bedding of the whole core.  In the test, it is jacketed in a core holder specifically designed to simultaneously measure six wave velocities at each pressure step: axial compressional, two axial shear, radial compressional and two radial shear. By adjusting the relative position of the sample bedding to the radial velocity transducers, variations of wave velocities with angles is determined; thereafter, the five elastic constants and three Thomsen parameters are calculated. For validation, one synthetic rock sample was constructed comprising thin layers of various materials. Three plugs were cut adjacently from the artificial rock in various orientations: one parallel, one perpendicular, and one at 45° to the bedding. The ultrasonic velocity measurements showed that elastic constants derived from the horizontal plug match very well with those from three plugs, confirming that only one horizontal core plug is necessary to analyze the elastic anisotropy of the transversely isotropic media. |The method's feasibility and applicability was demonstrated by performing the elastic anisotropy analysis at room temperature and various confining pressures on two real rock samples: one tight sand plug and one unconventional shale plug. Both plugs are cut horizontally and exhibit characteristics of layers/beddings or a horizontal zone filled with different minerals. For the tight sand plug, wave velocities measured along the axial direction are in good agreement with those from the radial direction.

Drilling overpressured and deep reservoirs is a challenge in itself, but can be complicated by the need to drill through depleted (depressurized) shallower reservoirs. The field under study consists of multiple stacked clastic reservoirs bounded by steeply dipping sealing faults. The deeper reservoirs fall in the high pressure high temperature (HPHT) category and account for one third of the in-place volumes. Ideally, field development for such stacked reservoirs is recommended through the bottom-up strategy to prevent late-in-life drilling through depleted zones with reduced drilling window and increased risk of fluid losses and well failure. Here, this would imply drilling and developing the deeper HPHT reservoirs before the shallow, normally pressured reservoirs. From a technical and financial perspective, it is tempting to develop and produce the shallow, normally pressured reservoirs (that contain 70% of the volumes and also have better flow properties) first, and bring the deeper HPHT reservoirs on-stream later. But, is such phased development of the reservoirs possible? Or would producing from the shallower reservoirs first permanently damage our ability to drill and produce the deeper HPHT reservoirs at a later stage in field life? These were the questions we tried to answer in this work. 
We built a full-field finite element model to simulate the geomechanical response of the reservoirs to pressure depletion i.e. quantify the displacement, strains and total stress changes in and around the reservoirs as a function of production. Such geomechanical models can serve as a predictive tool to help answer the questions above. In this paper, we show the construction and application of such a geomechanical model in field development planning. Our paper highlights how our geomechanical model results were applied, together with other work, to develop this field safely and efficiently, emphasizing field life cycle value. 
Background 
The drilling window for any hole section is defined as the pressure difference between the fracture gradient (the maximum allowable mud weight (MW) that may cause fracturing of the formation) and the minimum MW required to balance pore pressure and prevent hole collapse.  At reservoir depths, for fields in normal faulting (Sv > Shmax > Sh) or strikeslip faulting (Shmax > Sv > Sh) stress regime, the fracture propagation gradient is mainly driven by the magnitude of the minimum total horizontal stress (Sh). The Sh in the reservoirs changes due to hydrocarbon production operations (decreases with reservoir depletion). Therefore, with depletion, the upper bound of the allowed MW i.e. the fracture gradient decreases in the reservoirs. 
The minimum MW for depleted sand-shale reservoir system is driven by the wellbore pressure required for shale borehole stability. In depleting reservoirs, the thicker interbedded shale layers may remain at or close to the virgin fluid pressures across production period due to low permeability. The minimum MW for depleted sand-shale reservoir system is then driven by the wellbore pressure required for shale borehole stability. Thus, the drilling window progressively reduces with depletion as the minimum MW is maintained, while the maximum allowable MW is reduced [1, 2, 3].|","drilling window, seal integrity, Phased development, reservoir compaction, field development plan"

In naturally fractured reservoirs, hydraulic fracture treatments may induce complex fracture geometries which cannot be modeled accurately and efficiently using Cartesian and corner-point grid systems or standard dual porosity approaches. The interaction of hydraulic and naturally occurring fractures almost certainly plays a role in ultimate well and reservoir performance. Current simulation models are unable to capture the complexity of this interaction. Generally speaking, our ability to detect and characterize fracture systems is far beyond our capability of modeling complex natural fracture systems. In order to evaluate production performance in these complex settings using numerical simulation, fracture networks require advanced meshing and domain discretization techniques. This paper investigates these issues by developing natural fracture networks using fractal-based techniques. Once a fracture network is developed we demonstrate the feasibility of gridding complex natural fracture behavior using optimization-based unstructured meshing algorithms. It can then be demonstrated that natural fracture complexities such as variable aperture, spacing, length and strike can be simulated. This new approach is a significant step beyond the current method of dual porosity simulation which essentially negates the sophisticated level of fracture characterization pursued by many operators. |We use currently established code for fractal discrete fracture network (FDFN) models to build realizations of naturally fractured reservoirs in terms of stochastic fracture networks. From outcrop, image log and core analysis, it is possible to extract fracture fractal parameters pertaining to aperture, spacing, length distribution, including center distribution as well as a fracture strike. Then these parameters are used as input variables for the FDFN code to generate multiple realizations of fracture networks mimicking fracture clustering and randomly distributed natural fractures. After incorporating hydraulic fractures, complex fracture networks are obtained for further reservoir domain discretization. |In order to discretize the complex fracture networks, a new mesh generation approach is developed to conform to non-orthogonal and low-angle intersections of extensive-clustered discrete fracture networks with non-uniform aperture distribution. Optimization algorithms are adopted to reduce highly skewed cells, and to ensure good mesh quality around fracture tips, intersections and regions of extensive fracture clustering. Moreover, Local Grid Refinement (LGR) is implemented with a pre-defined distance function to control cell sizes and shapes around and far away from fractures. Natural fracture spacing, length, strike and aperture distribution are explicitly gridded thus introducing a new simulation approach that is far superior to dual porosity simulation. Finally initial sensitivity studies are performed to demonstrate both the capability of the optimization-based unstructured meshing algorithms, and the effect of aforementioned natural fracture parameters on well performance.|","Pressure Transient Analysis, Uncentainty Analysis, Reservoir Characterization and Simulation, Unstructured PEBI Grids, Hydraulically and Naturally Fractured Reservoirs"

Sand control techniques are widely used in industry to prevent sand production.  However these techniques significantly increase completion cost and complexity as well as can potentially impact production and field economics.  Hence it is preferred not to install sand control if one can be assured that the sand volume which will be produced is manageable.  However, there are no tools or workflows which can consistently and accurately predict the expected sand volume and timing over the life of the field without a large range of uncertainty. 
In this study, sand production characteristics were tested in three different sandstone outcrops under varying fluid flow conditions.  The test results show different sanding behavior for brine, oil, and gas flow.  Samples tested with brine fail catastrophically when stress is applied which slightly exceeds the onset of sand production stress.  Samples with gas flow produce small amounts of sand even when the stress significantly exceeds the onset of sand production.  The test results also demonstrated the importance of drawdown pressure on sand production, where an increase in drawdown has the potential to significantly increase the sand production.  Subsequently both numerical and empirical models were developed to estimate and predict sand production volume.  These models have been able to model field sand production cases reasonably well 
Introduction 
Risk of sand production is considered to be a major economic and technical issue in field developments with large expected drawdowns, depletion or relatively unconsolidated rock.  Unnecessary sand control leads to expensive completions and potentially high skins which can result in lower productivity and poor recovery.  However, inadequate sand control may lead to sand production problems.  The produced sand can erode and damage downhole and surface equipment, including downhole pumps, chokes and flowlines.  Produced sand may also fill the wellbore, restrict production, and require costly workovers and cleanup operations.  
Historically, downhole sand control equipment is installed to eliminate sand production from these formations.  As reserves are discovered in ever more challenging environments, such as deep water, heavy oil, and high-pressure/high-temperatures, well completions are required to balance multiple conflicting operational and business drivers.  Traditional downhole sand control methods can significantly increase the complexity and cost of the completions which can challenge the field development economics.  For these reasons, allowing some sand production and managing sand on surface has gained momentum in recent years [1-3].  
In order to manage sand on surface, predicting the onset of sand production is not sufficient.  Significant effort in the industry has been focused on modeling the evolution of sand production with time both experimentally and theoretically [4-9].  Sand production is a complex process.  Sand production rate and volume are not controlled only by geomechanical factors, such as rock strength and stresses, but are also influenced by hydrodynamic processes.  Reservoir depletion, changing production rate, increasing water cut, and changing gas-oil ratio over the well life all influence the sand production rate and volume.   Therefore modeling and predicting sand production rate and volume over time is much more problematic than predicting the onset of sand production.|","Volume, Production, Sand, Rate"

Srinivas, BP Exploration & Production Inc| Del Mundo, Fulbert Crisologo, BP Exploration & Production Inc| Litvak, Michael Lev, BP Exploration & Production Inc| Flynn, James John, BP Exploration & Production Inc| Edwards, Stephen T., BP Exploration & Production Inc","|Abstract |The example field in the Gulf of Mexico has been on production for seven years. Natural reservoir pressure decline has altered the stress regime and reservoir sand fracture pressure in certain regions of the field. Company drilling practices have established maximum Drilling Pressure Depletion Limits (DPDL) which are based on geomechanical analysis and wellbore strengthening theory. These limits must be considered to ensure safe and reliable drilling of new development wells in producing reservoirs. As reservoir pressure declines with production, the pressure depletion at a future wells target location may exceed the DPDL for that location. The risk of this occurrence may be managed through production curtailment at neighboring wells. This would reduce the pressure depletion at the target well location. However, this action would result in deferred production and value loss. Production curtailment can be minimized by sequencing the wells to take advantage of the characteristics of the existing well stock and the reservoir. |A full-field reservoir simulation model (FFM) is one of the tools used to guide the well sequencing in order to honor DPDLs at proposed well locations and minimize production curtailment. Building a robust well sequence is a multi-week trial-and-error process. The process determines if the DPDL at a target well location is exceeded, then selects the existing offset producers that need to be curtailed, and the duration of the offset well production deferral to raise the target well location reservoir pressure. The arduous, lengthy process precluded extensive what-if scenario evaluation. The resulting drilling sequence would have required significant production deferral over a time window in the future to facilitate drilling of the proposed development wells. The challenge was to optimize the development well drilling plan to reduce, if not eliminate, the field production deferral while drilling all the new wells safely by honoring the DPDLs at the proposed target locations. The challenge was met by developing a new automated, systematic and efficient procedure. This entailed building a pressure depletion tracking and management algorithm into the reservoir simulator and coupling it with the companys existing proprietary technology for field development option evaluation and optimization. This novel technology development automatically tracks the pressure at each target well location in the reservoir simulation model, selects the offset wells/zones that require production curtailment, and calculates the curtailment duration for thousands of potential well sequences to drill the future development wells. The well sequences are then ranked on the ability to honor the DPDLs at the target locations and associated production deferral. |The technology has made a step change in the evaluation cycle time by automating the systematic investigation of over 2000 well sequences, many of which are not intuitive. Errors were minimized through a standardized process that also permitted a broader evaluation of alternative reservoir scenarios. It has allowed us to evaluate the impact of various uncertainties including: DPDLs, stress path re-pressurization ratio, well productivity, and reservoir connectivity. This technology allows one to either develop a drilling sequence of water injectors and producers which minimizes/eliminates the offset producer curtailment or minimizes the offset producer curtailment for a given development well drilling sequence. We were then able to make an informed choice in selecting a well sequence that best achieves the multiple goals of drilling new wells safely, leveraging learning, identifying risk mitigation strategies, and reducing production deferral and enhancing value.|","Innovative automated option evaluation, Reservoir Pressure Management, minimize production deferral, drilling depleted reservoirs, well drilling sequence optimization"

In 2010, exploration of gas-rich and possible liquid-rich shale reservoirs began in northern Mexico. The initial challenges as in any exploration project were to demonstrate the availability of reserves and set the foundation for future development of plays. Wells were aimed at the upper cretaceous Eagle Ford formation and at the Jurassic Pimienta formation. While exploration campaign continues, the first development wells have been drilled in some areas. A total of 19 horizontal wells have been drilled and completed by January 2014. 
The wells drilled in the latest stage of the exploration campaign in the Pimienta formation presented additional complexity, which led to an undesired trend of increased costs and extended completion times. Also, some of the wells drilled and completed during an earlier stage of the exploration campaign showed a rapid decline in production which directly threatened future development plans. To reverse these trends, a novel dynamic diversion technology for hydraulic fracturing treatments was implemented with positive results. This technology improves distribution of hydraulic fracturing treatments along the horizontal section of the wells, therefore allowing the stimulation of longer perforated intervals at once, ensuring that a great majority of the perforated clusters are efficiently stimulated. The need for mechanical plugs, to isolate the different hydraulic fracturing stages in the wells; the risk associated with pump down of plugs and milling times to remove these plugs were greatly  reduced, which results in improved completion times and costs. 
This study presents four case histories in which the technology was applied. One of the cases refers to re-fracturing operations of the last 3 stages in a well with a horizontal section of approximately 1,500m which was initially stimulated with 17 hydraulic fracturing stages. The remaining cases refer to the completion of three exploratory wells in which the horizontal section was stimulated with multiple hydraulic fracturing stages using the dynamic diversion technology. The treatments were evaluated using different techniques which mainly included: radioactive tracers and pressure response analysis. Initial results showed evidence of diversion both in pressure response and tracer log analysis, as well as stable production after stimulation. Interpretation of radioactive tracer logs and numerical production forecasting results confirm effectiveness of methodology applied. 
The application of this technology can lead to a significant improvement in the efficiency of completions and effectiveness of stimulations of unconventional reservoirs in Mexico and around the world.|","Shale, Unconventional, Dynamic, Diversion, Stimulation"

To the west the Delaware Basin, located in southeastern New Mexico (SE NM) and West Texas, once thought to be extinct, has been revived through horizontal drilling and completion technologies. These tight formations, more importantly the Bone Spring formation, that were once uneconomic through vertical completions, have seen dramatic production and economic improvements with the advancement of horizontal drilling and completion technology lending to different requirements for proppant and fluid rheology for hydraulic fracturing optimization. |The Bone Spring formation in SE NM is a thick sequence of interbedded sandstones, carbonates, and shales with depths ranging from 6,000  13,000 that gradually deepens toward the southern part of the Delaware Basin.  The discovery of an oil rich 1st, 2nd , and 3rd Bone Spring formation amid a much more gas-prone Avalon and Wolfcamp clearly demonstrates the complexity of the Delaware Basin, and does not adhere to either conventional or unconventional expectations of hydrocarbon development. |Due to this complexity, the following paper will describe the reservoir and completion concerns that have arisen from the deeper 2nd Bone Spring formation located in Lea County, NM and how adapting current industry completion techniques have proven to enhance the overall development.  Topics that will be discussed in this paper include: |Landing interval/lateral target point |Stage spacing/perf clusters/perf strategy |Hydraulic fracture treatment design optimization |The benefits of employing ceramic proppant |Increased productivity and EUR of 30% |Production choke management and proppant flowback |Case history overview based on two re-entry horizontals and nine new-drill laterals |Horizontal drilling along with hydraulic fracturing have become the keys to unlocking potential reserves within the various Bone Spring formations.

Recently the application of multiple hydraulic fractures along horizontal wells has made possible the exploitation of unconventional reservoirs, such as shale gas and shale oil. However, the process of horizontal well fracturing is uncertain and it is not fully understood yet. There exist many questions about the number and position of created fractures and whether or not the fracture stays contained within the main reservoir thickness. |This work presents the modeling and analysis of temperature data during and after the creation of multiple fractures along a horizontal well. Our model accounts for fracture growth and closure, the well effects and interaction between multiple fractures. |The interference between multiple fractures growing simultaneously and the presence of reservoir permeability heterogeneity were investigated. Capabilities and limitations of information carried by temperature data are presented through different geometry analyses. |A special consideration of fracture growth out of zone was addressed. For this case it was considered that one of the hydraulic fractures activates a preexisting fault and interconnects the reservoir with other zones hundreds of feet away. |Our work shows the advantage of using continuous distributed temperature data in comparison with the traditional single-point pressure analysis. The local characteristic of temperature allows us to identify not only which of the created hydraulic fractures has interconnected the main reservoir with a different zone, but also the location of this zone. We also account for the effect of the interconnection on the growth of the other hydraulic fractures along the horizontal wellbore. |The simultaneous multiple fracture growth shows that falloff distributed temperature data can predict the number of created fractures. More than that, in presence of heterogeneity the interaction between the contained fractures can be captured by the temperature analysis. Different from the pressure analysis, distributed temperature data can differentiate between different heterogeneity locations along the wellbore. |Throughout this paper we present a series of examples where the temperature can provide information that would not be obtained from the traditional pressure analysis. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing is a complex mathematical problem that involves the mechanical interaction of the propagating fracture with the fluid dynamics of the injected fluid (Gidley et al., 1989). The modeling of the hydraulic fracturing process involves the coupling of at least three processes: the mechanical deformation induced by the fluid pressure on the fracture surfaces; the flow of fluid within the fracture; and the fracture propagation. Usually, the solid (rock) deformation is modeled using the theory of linear elasticity, which is represented by an integral equation that determines the nonlocal relationship between the fracture width and the fluid pressure (Economides and Nolte, 2000; Howard and Fast, 1970). |Multifracture treatments have proven to be an effective method for developing oil and gas especially in unconventional reservoirs. Although the use of horizontal multifractured wells is extensive, the process of horizontal well fracturing remains uncertain and it is not fully understood yet. |In most cases, hydraulic fracturing field operations in horizontal wells are performed by dividing the well length in many intervals (or stages) and fracturing them sequentially from toe towards the heel. In cased and cemented formations the operation starts by perforating the first stage of interest. Following the perforation of the interval, high rate fluid injection and fracture creation starts. When a stage injection period is over, a plug is set to isolate that interval, and the adjacent one is then perforated and the fracturing fluid injection starts again. This process goes on from the toe to the heel until the scheduled sequence is completed. Another approach is the use of open-hole packers with fracture sleeves (Holley et al., 2012).|","Multiple zone interconnection, Horizontal well, Temperature analysis, Hydraulic fracture"

Stress-dependent permeability of the rock (matrix) was measured using the pulse decay permeability method. Triaxial compression tests were also conducted to determine the Youngs modulus and Poissons ratio, compressive strength, and residual strength after peak failure. Linear MohrCoulomb failure envelopes (cohesion and friction angle) were also constructed for the intact rock and the rock after failure.

The fracture intensity and types vary from one shale to another. Even within the same shale in the same field, the heterogeneity of fracture intensity can be often expected to be high in a horizontal well. The current popular geometrical completion design can potentially ignore the existence of natural fractures.  Hence, maximizing stimulation efficiency without understanding existing natural fractures can be a challenge.  In this paper, study was made of the majority of the published case studies related to natural fractures in the US shales in the last 20 years. The evidence of natural fractures from either outcrops or subsurface data, i.e. core, borehole images, or other data is summarized for each studied shale. The latest studies show that the hydraulic fracture propagation can be strongly influenced by existing natural fractures regardless of whether they are open or closed. The roles of existing fractures in the shales include: 1) providing enhanced reservoir permeability for improved productivity if they are open and effectively connected by hydraulic fractures; 2) promoting much better fracturing network complexity regardless of whether they are open or closed prior to the stimulation; 3) giving possible negative impact sometimes, i.e. high water cut, if they are connected with wet zones below or above the reservoirs. It can be concluded that engineered completion designs that employ accurate knowledge of natural fracture data, in-situ stresses, and other reservoir and completion quality indicators as inputs can provide opportunities for enhancing stimulation efficiency and fracturing network complexity. This in turn can lead to better connectivity to a larger reservoir volume and access to more drainage area in the shales. |Introduction |The US shale gas story actually featured natural fractures. William Hart, a local gunsmith, drilled the first commercial natural shale gas well in US in Fredonia, Chautauqua County, NY in 1821, in shallow, low-pressure rock with fractures[1] [2]. The well was first dug to a depth of 27ft in a shale which outcropped in the area, then later drilled to a depth of 70ft using 1.5 inch diameter borehole. The produced gas was piped to an innkeeper on a stagecoach route[1]. Then the well was produced without any stimulation for 37 years until 1858 when it supplied enough natural gas for a grist mill and for lighting in four shops. It was a combination of the idea from Mr. Hart to drill the well and the presence of the natural fractures in the gas shale that made the 1st commercial shale gas discovery possible in shale gas history.|","US Shales, Unconventional  Reservoirs, Natural fractures"

Two high valued sources of information are used for this purpose. Information provided by the EIA (Energy Information Administration) from USA and by the Secretary of Energy from our country. |According to the American source, in 2012 Argentina was the most important natural gas producer and the fourth oil and other liquids producer in South America. However, regulations on the energy sector include policies that limit the attraction of private sectors to invest while protecting consumers from rising prices. As a result of this policy the demand of energy in the country continues growing as the oil and gas production declines leading the country to depend on imports of fuels. In fact, the data provided by the Argentinean Energy Secretary (Secretaria de Energia) agrees with this point of view. So, without an aggressive investment plan, the energetic crisis in the country could be increased in the short term. Argentina is currently engaged in the development of its unconventional resources. It must be mentioned that the country ranks fourth in the world in shale oil resources, and second in shale gas and aims to become a leader in unconventional oil and gas development. |This plan needs trained professionals to face the challenge of energy development to achieve full self-sufficiency in the country. |ITBA (Instituto Tecnologico de Buenos Aires) engages to join this process with the appropriate formation of its students in order to give the appropriate tools to develop their profession with academic excellence. |ITBA has been teaching Petroleum Engineering since 1991 with first graduates in 1994.

With the advent of sliding sleeve technology, operational efficiency could be gained; however, the effectiveness of the completion remained unclear. This paper details the necessary datasets to gather and a workflow to analyze them in order to optimize completion efficiency. A field trial of the optimized completion design, along with similar data gathering, could then be done to confirm the results from the previous dataset. |By varying completion and isolation styles on a select set of wells and obtaining a wide range of data, an optimized design can be obtained at a fraction of the cost, including isolation type, job size, stage length, number of entry points, entry type, perforation scheme, and rate. In Phase 1, an s-shaped pilot well was drilled for core, specialty logs, DFITs, and microseismic monitoring. A combination of sliding sleeves, rapid frac sleeves, and plug and perf were used across two open-hole adjacent laterals. Two cemented laterals were used initially as horizontal monitors and then to test different proppant volumes and number of clusters. The tracer program was designed to examine both stage isolation and well-to-well communication. Hydraulic Fracture Pressure History Matching (FPHM) was done on all stages; trends of propped fracture area and proppant concentration could be broken out by completion and isolation type. |Cemented, three entry point plug and perf was the clear winner. The FPHM and microseismic analysis demonstrated that this design reduced out-of-zone height growth and tracer results showed it minimized stage-to-stage and well-to-well communication. Multivariate analysis suggested an optimal stage length and pounds of proppant per foot. Using the results from all the datasets, the optimized completion design could be input into the calibrated fracture model to forward model the predicted fracture geometry. Phase 2 was implemented to test the effectiveness of the new design and test the applicability of the calibrated fracture model. A microseismic and tracer (water, proppant and oil) program was executed and FPHMs were conducted. The FPHMs showed that actual fracture geomoetries were very close to what the model was predicting. There was also greater containment with the new design from a microseismic and tracer perspective. Finally, production exceeded the predictive production models from the multivariate analysis. |This project provided an optimized completion design that could be used across an area of interest, but there was valuable insight beyond the completion design itself. Numerous lessons were learned about data acquisition and how to improve data quality with future projects. Fracture azimuth was confirmed with microseismic and tracer data. The effects of depletion could be seen by these datasets as well. The FPHM outputs also provided insight into height growth out of the pay zone being attributed to higher rates and fewer entry points. The importance of WOR was also evident with the multivariate analysis.|","Microseismic, Williston Basin, Completion Optimization, Fracture Model, Tracer"

Most sedimentary rock formations (tight or highly porous) have geochemical characteristics that can lead to significant reactive ion exchange processes in aqueous media in the presence of carbondioxide. While geomechanical properties such as rock stiffness, Poissons ratio and fracture geometry largely govern fluid flow characteristics in deep fractured formations, the effect of mineralization can lead to flow impedance in the presence of favorable geochemical and thermodynamic conditions. Shale caprock which seals more than 60% of oil and gas reservoirs have natural fractures that are unevenly distributed in the geosystem.  Experimental works which employed the use of analytical techniques such ICP-OES, XRD, and SEM/EDS techniques in investigating diagenetic and micro-structural property of crushed shale caprock/CO2-brine system concluded that net precipitation reaction processes can affect the distribution of petrophysical nanopores in the seal rock. The results showed that geochemical precipitates can be formed such that fluid flow through open micro and macro fractures may be constrained. Simulation results reported by various researchers suggested that influx-induced mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions within shale caprocks can continuously close micro-fracture networks, while pressure and effective-stress transformation first rapidly expand then progressively constrict them. This experimental research investigates the impact of in-situ geochemical precipitation on conductivity of open micro-fractures under geomechanical stress conditions. Fracture conductivity in core samples of shale caprock with known mineralogical composition from different formations where CO2 injection is on-going are quantitatively evaluated under axial and radial stress using pressure pulse-decay liquid permeametry/core flooding systems. Modeling of the diffusion controlled fluid flow and induced fracture diagenetic alterations in the shale caprocks can be performed using CMG-GEM with artificial core imposing axial and radial geomechanical stress. The possibility of rock-fluid geochemical interactions constricting natural fracture conductivity in long term subsurface CO2 sequestration can lead to significant improvement in shale caprock seal integrity and mitigate injection induced geomechanical perturbation.

In order to correctly interpret microseismic data, a clear understanding of the mechanisms driving the generation of microseismicity is crucial. It is widely accepted and supported by full moment tensor inversion that microseismic activity associated with subsurface fluid injection is mainly caused by shear failure. Microseismic events can be separated into two main categories: near-field events and far-field events. Near-field events are the microseismic events close to the induced fracture (i.e. hydraulic fracture); as a result, the stress shadow effect (i.e. stress perturbation around a hydraulic fracture) is the dominant factor controlling such events. Far-field events are events that are not occurring in the vicinity of the tensile hydraulic fracture, hence the stress shadow effect is not the dominant phenomenon, but they are mainly controlled by pore pressure diffusion. Recent seismicity-based permeability characterization models couple fluid flow and reservoir geomechanics in order to capture microseismic mechanisms and calculate bulk reservoir-scale permeability. The same fundamentals were used in a forward modeling sense; by knowing reservoir properties we were able to predict the spatio-temporal distribution of microseismic activity. The effects of three parameters, including reservoir fluid viscosity, fracture fluid viscosity, and total reservoir compressibility were studied. Furthermore, the microseismic response of the reservoir in conjunction with instantaneous pump attributes was investigated. A physics-based model showed that increasing the viscosity of both reservoir and hydraulic fracture fluid will decrease the local extent of the propagation of the microseismic cloud. Studying the effect of reservoir compressibility showed that an increase in total reservoir compressibility decreases the local extent of the microseismic cloud. Results of the analysis were then used to explain observations made in field data and described in the literature. |Introduction |Microseismic events associated with subsurface fluid injection and hydraulic fracturing are well-known phenomena in the industry and literature (Ohtake, 1974; Raleigh, 1976; Fletcher and Sykes, 1977; Pearson, 1981; Simpson et al. 1988; Fehler and Philips, 1991; Zoback and Harjes, 1997; Sasaki, 1998; Warpinski et al. 2001; Audigane et al. 2002; Maxwell et al. 2010; Olson et al. 2011; McClure, 2012; Tarrahi and Jafarpour, 2012; Hosseini, 2012; Zoback and Gorelick, 2012; Hosseini, 2013).

Operators have used various production logging technologies in an attempt to understand completion efficiency. Even then, these low rate horizontal wells with unstable flow conditions and fluid segregation provide a challenging environment for production logging, and even the use of different tools / software provides no definitive answer. Absence of direct comparison between logging tools renders it difficult to assess the suitability of a particular tool in a given downhole environment. A field trial was thus conducted to acquire and compare the log data using two very different instruments, an array based logging tool and a downhole distributed fiber optic (DFO) with distributed temperature and acoustic sensing (DTS / DAS) capability. |A multiple array tool, consisting of multiple spinner and resistance arrays, was deployed downhole via tractor into a well that had been on production for approximately three months. Multiple up/down passes were made at different speeds in both lateral and vertical sections to assist with spinner calibration.

The existence of natural fractures is very important to the stimulation treatment and will eventually benefit the shale gas/oil reservoir recovery. The effect of natural fractures on a shale mechanical property study will serve as the basis for the formation evaluation and the sweetspot selection on the hydraulic fracturing treatment. By combining conventional destructive mechanical tests and novel digital rock nondestructive analysis, important conclusions can be determined regarding the mechanical properties changing trend as a function of the fracture structure. The more complex the natural fracture structures, the less resistant the rock. This paper presents, in detail, the changing trend from various shale samples. |Studies on the mechanical properties of Eagle Ford shale samples (e.g., Youngs modulus, Poissons ratio, etc.) are performed in a laboratory using a hydraulic load frame, and the core internal fractures are computed tomography (CT) scanned before and after the mechanical tests. The effect of natural fractures on the mechanical properties is analyzed through the testing data. The induced fractures are characterized in several Eagle Ford shale core plugs in terms of orientation, size, and width. Substantial image processing techniques are employed to analyze the three-dimensional (3D) rock microstructures. The statistical properties, such as the width, length, and the tortuosity of the main fractures, are obtained through image analysis. The volume of the fractures and the permeability on all x, y, and z directions on the central part of the core plug are calculated based on the 3D CT images as well.

One of the main challenges in development of the fractured reservoirs is the identification of sweet spots which are the most intensely fractured areas of a field, maintaining a long term production with minimized risks in drilling. This paper presents a multi-disciplinary approach including G&G (geology & geophysics), petrophysics and reservoir engineering perspective to overcome this difficulty in a particular oil reservoir by defining the fracture systems that mainly contributes to the hydrocarbon storage capacity and flow dynamics. 
Sambayat Field is one of the most important naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs located in the Southeast Turkey. Reservoir zones in the field include a number of reverse, synthetic and antithetic faults and related fracture sets which are hydraulically in contact with each other. In this context, characterizing the fracture network becomes the most critical issue in the analysis of production and the development strategy of the field. 
For this purpose; besides the conventional open-hole log analyses, image log interpretations have also been performed in order to evaluate the properties of the fractures. To honor these interpretations; dynamic (drill stem test & production) and static (outcrop & core) data have been evaluated together. Distributions of the petrophysical properties and the fractures have been done by using stochastic methods in full-field scale. At the end of the modeling study, a dual porosity geological model has been generated by using the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) approach with respect to the estimated fracture characteristics. 
As the result of the previous characterization study, new well locations and their optimized orientations had been determined and the results coincided with the expected types of fractures estimated in the DFN model. After updating the model with the new well data and the enhanced functionalities in the modeling software, additional well locations have been proposed which will play a role in one step further of the study; simulation. 
This study has contributed to our knowledge about the characteristics of a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir which is similar to the ones explored in Southeast Turkey and to some extend in Middle East. It should also be noted that, our approach in this particular study is a newly developing technique and could be used for the promising previously overlooked unconventional reservoirs. 
Introduction 
Sambayat Oil Field is located in the southeastern part of Turkey covering an area of 3.5 km2 (Figure-1). The field was discovered in 2008 by using 2D seismic data interpretation. After putting the first well on production, new wells had been drilled to define the extent of the reservoir which showed different aspects in terms of reservoir performance when compared with the nearby fields in the basin. Most of the wells started production with higher rates than expected and the test results showed that reservoir has complex fault and fracture systems which have an important role not only in the fluid flow but also in the storage of fluids with a connected fracture network system.|","Fracture Characterization, Reservoir Characterization, Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, DFN Modeling"

Present field rejuvenation plans include drilling and completing new infill and development wells from both an existing and a new platform. Most platform wells are currently producing sand and none have been completed with sand control. Sand production has caused erosion issues and lost production due to the need for regular separator clean outs, and is a key risk factor for both existing well integrity and new well completion design. A multi-disciplinary team was tasked with determining the causes of sand production, and to develop a fit for purpose sand management strategy for this mature, brownfield redevelopment. |A coupled geomechanical/sand failure model was employed to assess sand failure, and to evaluate alternatives to sand exclusion completions. The model was calibrated using existing well sand production data, then run for the proposed new wells to assess the potential for sand production over the remaining field life. The model confirmed that sand production is closely linked to reservoir depth, completion type, well inclination and, most importantly, depletion level. |An objective screening process was developed to rank sand control options. This considers existing and proposed well completion architecture, facilities design/limitations, and recognises inherent data uncertainties. The systematic sand management methodology allows a consistent, objective and transparent view of benefits and risks across the different system aspects.  Key selection criteria were utilised rather than arbitrary decisions based on limited and often unaudited data.  The process ensured a best practice, fit for purpose, and structured sand management solution. |In light of the currently low levels of sand production and the challenges associated with remedial or retro-fitting sand control, optimised surface sand management will continue to be the preferred solution for all existing wells. |Predicted sand production in most new wells is manageable.  Some wells targeting shallower or weaker sands would normally be sand control candidates, but re-thinking the completion design, optimising surface sand management procedures, managing drawdown and BHFP levels, and taking advantage of favourable stress vectors through oriented perforation can extend the sand free well operating envelopes over life of well production and depletion conditions, reducing or deferring the need for sand control in all but the highest sanding risk reservoirs. |Background |Field Details and Sand Production History |In 2012, Talisman entered into a production sharing contract to further develop the Kinabalu oil field, located 55 km west-north-west of Labuan, Malaysia (Fig. 1). The field was discovered in 1989 and was appraised by 5 wells, prior to embarking on the field development plan in 1998.  The field consists of three separate accumulations:  Kinabalu Main, Deep, and East (Fig. 2).  The bulk of the reserves are in the multiple stacked shoreface Miocene sands (F, J, K, L, M, and O ) in Kinabalu Main.

"157","170749-MS","Evolution of Porosity, Permeability, and Fluid Saturations During Thermal Conversion of Oil Shale","Kibodeaux, Kenneth R, Shell Int'l E&P","|Abstract 
The In-situ Conversion Process, called ICP, is a thermal recovery process that was developed to produce oil and gas from kerogen-bearing oil shale.  In-situ conductive heating of the oil-shale reservoir converts its kerogen (hydrogen-rich solids) into oil and gas (fluids) plus coke (hydrogen-deficient solids).  
While coke is left behind on the rock, hot vapor and heavy oil flow through the thermally altered oil shale to producer wells, and predicting ICP recovery performance depends on having an accurate characterization of the flow and storage behavior of the oil shale.  However the rock fabric changes radically during ICP - the rocks porosity and permeability change with time in a complex way.  While changing pore geometry (and pore-wall composition) also results in changing relative-permeability (kr) and capillary-pressure (Pc) curves, this work focuses on the evolution of oil and gas saturations (which dictate how krs and Pcs influence ICP performance), as well as the change in porosity and its resulting alteration of oil-shale permeability. 
Numerous pyrolysis experiments were performed in the laboratory, where crushed oil shale was heated and effluents were monitored.  Furthermore, through a series of otherwise identical experiments that were stopped at different degrees of conversion, changes in the oil-shale solids were determined by analyzing the spent rock.  Through these experiments, a reservoir simulation model was developed that, for a variety of oil shales and time scales, captures the chemical-reaction kinetics for the solids and fluids, and the phase behavior of the fluids.  Sensitivity studies with this model identified the changing oil-shale fluid-transport properties as a key driver for ICP performance. 
In this work, the ICP simulation model is used to illustrate ICP reservoir physics for different oil shales.  Simulations reveal how changing in-situ fluid compositions (due to chemical reactions, temperature increase, etc.) not only result in changing fluid properties, but also complex behavior with time for oil and gas saturations, and this saturation history governs in part the flow of oil and vapor to producers and thus ICP performance.  The early time following kerogen conversion is a period of higher oil saturation and thus higher oil mobility, illustrating how ICP production can include the flow of both vapor and heavy oil to producer wells. 
Another key to ICP success is the permeability history that results from the evolving porosity.  As kerogen converts to fluids, porosity first increases (owing to reactive grain loss), then decreases (from the deposition of coke).  While porosity behavior was determined from grain volumes measured in crushed-rock experiments, some complementary tests on pyrolyzed intact rock reveal increasing oil-shale permeability during ICP, which enables production from rock whose original permeability is quite low. Also simulations show that 90% of the pattern pyrolyzes after there are already permeable pathways developed connecting the pyrolyzing regions to the producer well. 
Introduction 
Oil shale is rock that contains kerogen, which may be considered a solid form of petroleum.  There are immense resources of oil shale worldwide (Biglarbigi et al., 2010): on the order of 8 trillion barrels of oil, more than ? of which is in the northwest United States.|","ICP, kerogen, thermal, permeability, shale"
"158","170733-MS","Dependence of Organic Pore Wettability on Kerogen Maturity: A Water Droplet Microscopic Simulation Study","Hu, Yinan, University of Oklahoma","|Abstract |Wettability in the organic pores of shales, known as kerogen, is essential information required for hydrocarbon estimation, multiphase flow transportation modeling, and the prediction of the recoveries and placement of hydraulic fracture water, especially in intermediate maturity oil shales. The process of kerogen maturation is accompanied by the loss of functionalized molecules, leading to a reduction of H/C and O/C values. These ratios are typically reflected in the van Krevelen diagram and are used to classify types of kerogen depending on their maturity degree. Recent studies have documented laboratory evidence of water content in kerogen. This leads to key questions of whether kerogen may have mixed-wet characteristics and how it is likely to depend on kerogen maturity. |In this paper, we present a pore-scale study analyzing the role of kerogen maturity on the wettability of organic pore systems. The traditional graphene model is chosen as a proxy for the organic matter. By grafting varying amounts of functionalized groups onto this surface, we construct the kerogen with varying degrees of maturity. We then study droplets of pure water on different surfaces and determine contact angles to quantify wettability. |We find that the contact angle variations of water droplets have a strong dependency on kerogen maturity. As the density of the surface functionalized groups increases, the wettability in kerogen could possibly be altered from hydrocarbon-wetting, to neutral-wetting, or even become hydrophilic. Additionally, we also demonstrate that there is a critical density of surface functionalized groups beyond which the kerogen pore system may be considered to be largely water-wet when water forms sheets adjacent to the pore wall. Our results indicate that the wettability in kerogen is very likely to be mixed-wetting. |Introduction |Shale resources are vast and abundant worldwide. In the United States, the organic-rich shale plays are vital to domestic energy supply and currently constitute the most productive oil and gas fields (EIA 2013). The tremendous growth in development activity is mainly due to the utilization of horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing to enlarge contact volume in these extremely low permeability reservoirs. The underlying production mechanisms, however, are not fully understood. Multi-disciplinary research focused on shale geomechanics and petrophysics, modeling of transport and storage, completions design and drilling continue to be driven by the considerable knowledge gaps in our understanding of shales. |The low recovery of hydraulic fracture water is one of the several key observations that remains poorly understood. For the Haynesville shale, recoveries as low as 5% have been reported while for the Barnett and Marcellus shales, the recovery of hydraulic fractured water tends to approach values closer to 50% (King 2012). The possible answers to this could be partly related to the mixed wettability characteristics of shales (Elijah 2011) and high capillary forces (Sondhi et al. 2011), as they may lead to counter-current imbibition of water when shales are exposed to hydraulic fractured water (Qin 2007). Hence, our current wettability study could provide some insights into this issue. |Quantification of shale gas-in-place estimates includes free, adsorbed, and solution gas (Ambrose 2011). The free gas is usually stored in the inorganic matrix where relatively larger pores and fractures exist. The adsorption phenomena are considered to be restricted to kerogen, which is the organic material and is finely dispersed within the inorganic matrix (Akkutlu et al 2011). The significant amount of surface areas in the organic matter provides sufficient space for adsorption and the importance of it to the total gas-in-place estimates has been recently reported in Xiong et al. (2012), Fathi et al. (2012). In addition, the pore confinement has an important impact on the amount of adsorption (Diaz-Campos 2010) and could possibly change phase behavior substantially (Sapmanee 2011, Devegowda et al. 2012, Didar 2012, Firincioglu 2013, Travalloni et al. 2013). Wettability is an important rock property as it affects the hydrocarbon in-place estimation and the quantity of hydrocarbon recovered. Our current view of the inorganic pore systems is water wetting in shales (Elijah 2011). However, the wettability in the organic matter is still a topic that is not fully understood. |",""

Yucel, Texas A&M Petroleum Engineering Dept","|Abstract |Measured permeability of an organic-rich shale sample vary significantly with applied laboratory conditions, such as the confining pressure, temperature and the measurement fluid type. This indicates that the measured quantity is influenced by several mechanisms that add complexity to the measurement. The complexity is mainly due to stress dependence of the matrix permeability. Also, it is due to the fact that organic-rich shale holds significant volumes of fluids in sorbed (adsorbed, dissolved) states, sorption can also influence the permeability through its own storage and transport mechanisms. The stress-dependence and sorption effects on permeability could develop under the reservoir conditions and influence the production, although we currently do not have a predictive permeability model that considers their co-existence. |In this work this is accomplished by considering that the shale matrix consists of multiple continua with organic and inorganic pores. Stress-dependency of the permeability comes along with slit-shape inorganic pores, whereas the sorption effects are associated with nano-scale organic capillaries. A simple conceptual flow model with an apparent shale permeability is developed that couples the molecular transport effects of the sorbed phase with the stress-dependence of the inorganic matrix. |Sensitivity analysis on the new permeability model shows that the stress-dependence of the overall transport is significant at high pore pressure, when the effective stress is relatively low. Diffusive molecular transport of the sorbed phase becomes important as the stress gets larger and, hence, the inorganic pores close. The constructed apparent permeability versus pore pressure curves show the dominance of the molecular transport as permeability improvement characterized by appearance of a minimum permeability value at the intermediate values of the pressure. The new permeability model can be used easily in history-matching a well performance and optimizing its production. |1. Introduction |A shale well production profile is characterized by a large initial production rate followed by a sharp decline. The rate decline during the first year of production could be as large as 90 % of that recorded during the first days. Because of this production behavior and due to economical considerations, the operators continuously drill and complete wells in the field. This way, an overall production is maintained in the field, which makes the field operations still profitable. As a consequence, an enormous amount of well data on drilling, well completion and production is coming from the field within a very short time span compared with the conventional reservoirs. Commonly, the engineers do not have sufficient time to analyze the production from each well and relate the analyses to well-performance and near-well reservoir characteristics. Consequently, the large production data set is more commonly used with the statistical indicators for the ongoing development of the whole field. Understanding the physics underlying the production and using that knowledge in the decision-making process comes at lower priority for the development. However, when it reaches to a maturity and tested in the field, the knowledge could help decrease the uncertainties in production and lead to improved recoveries.|","organic rich shale permeability, effective stress, adsorption"

The presence of nanopores in tight, rich-gas-condensate wells (3,000 to ~10,000 scf/STB) may hold long-term gas/oil ratio (GOR) trends constant with time as observed in production data from some North American shales. This finding contrasts with some of the numerical simulation forecasts performed on calibrated pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) models based on bulk laboratory PVT data. Research efforts have pointed to a decrease in the PVT phase envelopes of hydrocarbon fluids confined in nanopores. This would delay the onset of dew point pressure and condensate liquid dropout and could be one of the causes of the observed constant producing GOR in the wells studied. 
An understanding of fluid properties in nanopores is fundamental to predicting the onset of condensate dropout in shale reservoirs. One approach may be molecular dynamics simulations that can shed the light on the difference in behavior of larger-chain hydrocarbon molecules at kerogen surfaces and bulk pore space. Additionally, shale gas condensate production management may be more fully optimized by understanding both the effects of hydraulic fracture degradation with drawdown and liquid dropout in the production string. An integrated approach of this kind can help optimize liquid-rich shale reservoir production management. 
Introduction 
Gas condensates behave contrary to what we expect from normal gases: an isothermal decrease in pressure causes liquid to form at the condensate dewpoint because of interactions between heavier molecules in the gas condensate fluid. Gas condensates typically produce with gas-oil-ratio (GOR) between 3,300 and 15,000 scf/STB, although the upper limit is less well defined (McCain 1990). 
As the pressure in the near-wellbore region drops below the dewpoint during production, liquid condensate droplets are formed and tend to remain in the reservoir rock and not produce because of relative permeability effects. This generally causes the producing GOR to increase with time. A ring of condensate liquid may form around the wellbore and reduces the gas deliverability (Deng 2013) or well productivity. After significant condensate liquid saturation builds up, some of the condensate liquid begins to flow towards the producing well (Fan 2005). Well productivity decline in shale gas condensate wells may be more severe because pressure drawdown gradients are large. Yet a number of shale gas condensate wells are still producing in North America years after first production, suggesting that the productivity of these wells may not be dramatically declining. 
Liquid hydrocarbon production from tight organic mudstones has increased in recent years, in line with a favorable commercial environment. Despite this, industry still lacks understanding of hydrocarbon fluid flow in the nanopores in these reservoirs because their behavior is so highly unconventional. The complexity of fluid flow and fluid properties in unconventional reservoirs has led to technological challenges in nanoscale measurements and modeling. |","Condensate, phase diagram, shale, unconventionals, nano"

Shale gas reservoirs are difficult to produce unless effectively stimulated. Hydraulic fracturing along with drilling has been a technology that makes it possible to produce natural gas from such reservoirs. Hydraulically fractured wells are usually modeled in fracture simulators, and it has been observed from the literature that modeling of horizontal wells with multiple hydraulic fractures is needed in the industry. In this paper, a series of simulations are carried out to quantify the effect of the performance of various types of fracture models on the productivity of the well. The fracture closure stress acting on the proppant placed in the pay zone arises as a result of the stresses and pressures acting on and in the fracture. These stresses are also known to bring about a change in the fracture flow capacity and conductivity, thereby having a significant influence on the reservoir performance. In this paper, various fracture models are considered and have been simulated in a fracture simulator, to observe their impact on the productivity of the well. Further, mathematical modeling of the fractures has been done to observe the effect of stress on the fracture characteristics, and hence on the production. The main aim of this paper is to assess the impact of fracture models and its characteristics on shale productivity and to quantify the effect of stress on fracture.|",""

The methodology on the formation failure and modeling analysis for sand production and sand rate prediction is provided for the HPHT gas and gas condensate field located offshore in the UKs Central North Sea. Sand production caused by the failure of reservoir formations through pressure depletion and drawdown pressure could lead to a significant loss in well production, well/facility damage or ultimately total well failure. The key objective of this evaluation and sand rate prediction analysis was to develop a well completion design that will deliver effective sand control throughout the producing life of the field. |Over the field life it is both critical and prudent to predict the sanding potential of a given reservoir during continuous well production for any completion design under consideration. This paper illustrates our comprehensive geomechanics investigation for sanding potential and sand rate prediction analysis for all the planned wells to be drilled and completed in the very thick sandstone reservoirs. Well also show that if the reservoir rock strength and its variability along depth are properly measured for each well (through well core testing and log data analysis), the conditions that induce sand production issues for each specific interval could be predicted. In addition, the most important factors contributing to sanding problems have been identified to be the rock strength, flowing bottom-hole pressure, reservoir pressure, in-situ stresses, and flow rate. Therefore if permeability distribution and oil/gas and water saturations were measured (for each well) in addition to the reservoir rock strength, the optimal completion method to reduce the likelihood of sand production problems without significantly impacting production could be found. A 3D non-linear elastic-plastic finite element model incorporated with a fluid-flow module (reservoir component) has been effectively used to conduct such analysis. The key findings from this investigation can be summarized as follows: |The sand production rates based on the planned reservoir depletion and production schedules are predicted for each of the eight wells as planned for the field development; |We can further update the original sand rate prediction model using the new rock strength and permeability/porosity test results obtained from the immediate testing of the new well cores as retrieved from one of the early development wells; |The predicted sand rates in both daily and total sand production are low enough to warrant our sand management (rather than sand exclusion) approach to this new field; and |The sand prediction results enable us to come up with optimal well platform/facility design to cope with the predicted sand rates to be produced throughout the reservoir life. The production engineers can also make sure that the overall safety of the facility is to be achieved by conducting regular and periodic inspections of any likely sand erosion for the surface chokes or pipes in the wells that especially have been forecast to produce more prolifically with relatively higher sand rates.","sand erosion and sand monitoring, Sand production prediction, Elasto-Plastic finite element model, Sand management, optimal well completion design"

J., The University of Texas at Austin, Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering| Jung, Hojung, The University of Texas at Austin, Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering| Sharma, Mukul M., The University of Texas at Austin, Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering","|Abstract 
Diagnostic Fracture Injection Tests (DFIT) are commonly interpreted with G-function derivative plots. In these plots, an upward deviation from linearity is generally attributed to fracture height recession or transverse storage. This interpretation neglects changing fracture compliance during closure. Results presented in this study show that in low permeability formations, an upward deviation of the G-function plot G*dP/dG is caused by a sharp reduction in fracture compliance due to closure. It is not necessary to invoke more complicated explanations such as height recession or transverse storage. The specific shape of the G*dP/dG curve is controlled by factors that affect fracture compliance before and after closure. These factors include the fracture height, fracture stiffness, and the residual aperture (which is affected by the microscopic and macroscopic roughness of the created hydraulic fracture). Wellbore storage broadens the post-closure peak in the G*dP/dG curve. A curve of G*dP/dG that constantly increases during the shut-in period may be caused by wellbore storage, rather than fracture tip extension. In higher permeability formations (with non-zero wellbore storage), the effect of fracture compliance is less important. As a result, changing fracture compliance during closure does not have a significant effect on the pressure transient plots, and closure decreases the rate of pressure decline because it reduces the rate at which fluid can leak off into the matrix. In all cases, as long as a single planar fracture has formed, the best pick for the minimum principal stress is at the deviation from linearity on the G*dP/dG plot, whether or not this departure is concave up or concave down. Closure picks via a tangent to near the peak in G*dP/dG (as is commonly performed) may significantly underestimate the minimum principal stress. These picks should be confirmed with other measurements, such as a subsequent injection period or a pump-in flow-back test. The fact that an extremely sharp upward trend in G*dP/dG is generally not observed in DFIT tests suggests that the actual geometry of the created fracture is rougher and more complex than is typically assumed by standard models.|","Low permeability, Hydraulic fracturing, Unconventional, DFIT, Pressure transient"

Horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing are the two key enabling technologies for the economic development of these shale gas reservoirs. It is believed that gas in shale reservoirs is mainly composed of free gas within fractures and pores and adsorbed gas in organic matter (kerogen). It is generally assumed in the literature that the monolayer Langmuir isotherm describes gas adsorption behavior in shale gas reservoirs. However, in this work, we have analyzed several experimental measurements of methane adsorption from the Marcellus Shale core samples that deviate from the Langmuir isotherm, but obey the BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) isotherm. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to find that gas adsorption in a shale gas reservoir behaves like multilayer adsorption. Consequently, investigation of this specific gas desorption effect is important for accurate evaluation of well performance and completion effectiveness in shale gas reservoirs based on the BET isotherm. The difference in calculating original gas in place based on both isotherms is discussed. We also perform history matching with one production well from the Marcellus Shale and evaluate the contribution of gas desorption to the wells performance. History matching shows that gas adsorption obeying the BET isotherm contributes more to overall gas recovery than gas adsorption obeying Langmuir isotherm, especially early time in production. This work provides better understanding of gas desorption in shale gas reservoirs and updates our current analytical and numerical models for simulation of shale gas production. |Introduction |In recent years, the boom of shale gas production was fueled by the improvements in horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing technologies. As a result, shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas supply in North America and around the world. In nature, gas shales are characterized by extremely small grain size, extremely low permeability on the order of nano-Darcy (10-6 md), small porosity, and high total organic carbon (TOC). Shale can serve as both source and reservoir rock. The amount of gas in place in shale is strongly affected by the TOC, clays, and the adsorption ability of methane on the internal surface of solid (Martin et al., 2010). In general, complex fracture networks that are generated connect the shale formation and the horizontal well. Shale matrix has strong gas storage capacity but cannot transport the gas for long distance because it is very tight; a fracture network can transport the gas efficiently due to large hydraulic conductivity but has limited storage capacity (Lane et al., 1989; Carlson and Mercer, 1991). Since a part of gas in shale reservoirs is adsorbed, investigation of gas adsorption can provide critical insights into evaluation of well performance, shale characterization, and optimization of fracture design in shale gas reservoirs.|","BET isotherm, Hydraulic fracturing, Langmuir isotherm, Gas adsorption, Marcellus shale"

Observed trends of long-term production forecasts of unconventional assets tend to secure US energy supply for decades to come. Also, recent innovations in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing support such trends to be economically viable. However, triggered fractures in an unconventional reservoir rapidly shrink and will result in significant long-term production loss. Hence, it is essential to quantify the effect of fracture closure on long-term production. In this paper, the permeability changes of secondary fracture network are investigated with respect to the effect on the long-term gas production from unconventional reservoirs. 
A simple analytical trilinear model is improved in order to handle the constant bottom-hole pressure production and analyze the cumulative gas production by considering the effect of stress on natural fracture permeability. Moreover, a sensitivity study is performed to identify the influence of uncertain parameters on cumulative production and consequently detect a condition in which the pressure-dependent natural fracture effects on production are severe. 
It is observed that the pressure-dependent natural fracture permeability can cause up to ten percent less cumulative production than the constant natural fracture permeability conditions. The improved analytical model is very fast compared to the commercial numerical simulators. The advantage of this approach is in obtaining a quick and accurate assessment for operators in the pre-evaluation process of the complex production behavior of their unconventional resources. The findings of this paper provide insights into long-term investment of unconventional reservoirs and guide decision making for the secondary or tertiary enhancement treatments of unconventional wells, such as re-fracturing.|","Unconventional Reservoirs, Analytical modeling, Production loss, Natural fracture closure, Reservoir simulation"

The importance of the geomechanical modeling and wellbore instability analysis is increasing in the petroleum industry with recent growth of drilling plans in unconventional reservoirs. Recently, a large majority of field developments are occurring in shale oil and shale gas reservoirs as a novel source of energy. Many of these reservoirs are thin and highly layered, anisotropic and naturally fractured; these make their geomechanical modeling and wellbore instability analysis remarkably crucial; subsequently a good understanding of elastic properties of the formation such as Young's modulus, Poison's ratio and in-situ stresses are necessary for accurate results. 
Bakken Formation is one of the major unconventional plays in North America which is identified by three distinct members: layered upper and lower shale and fractured middle dolomite. The thin beddings within the formation have made them extremely anisotropic, which originates from the platey shaped clay particles, high kerogen content plus the existence of natural fractures thus the wellbore instability analysis and modeling of this formation has become highly challenging. For this study elastic properties along with the petrophysical values are collected and reported from several numbers of core plugs along with wireline log data. Then, these values are used as input parameters in poroelasticity equations to calculate the magnitude of the principal stresses. Finally instability analysis especially in the inclined section of the well is carried out. 
Finite Difference 3D numerical modeling was conducted under Mohr-Coulumb failure criterion with anisotropic assumptions to evaluate the deformations around the wellbore to locate instable regions. In addition, the effects of different inclination angles of the wellbore versus depth were studied. Results indicated a strong relation between the magnitude of the wellbore deformations with the the drilling inclination angle changing from vertical to horizontal which takes place in the direction of maximum horizontal principal stress. Stress contours are plotted around the wellbore shows zones of higher stress concentration and deformation. Various type of failure regions are developed as well.|","Unconventional, Wellbore Stability, Geomechanics"

Sustainable high fracture conductivity is a key to successful stimulation. The reduction of hydraulic fracture conductivity due to proppant deformation and crushing is frequently observed. Previous researches are based on laboratory experiments and empirical correlations, which can not fully explain proppant damage in field cases. In this paper, we applied our fully coupled fluid flow and geomechanical model to further understand the proppant pack deformation and crushing. 
Parametric studies on wellbore and reservoir pressures, formation properties, and proppant biot constant were performed to understand proppant deformation and crushing in different conditions. Additionally, an analytical model for avoiding proppant crushing was developed for fractured wells. 
Through this research, we found fracture conductivity loss due to deformation and crushing are severer than laboratory results. Large deformation and high probability of crushing were observed near wellbore according to the net pressure. Fast flow back (low bottom hole pressure) would generate large proppant crushed zone. Various reservoir properties as pressure gradient, formation stiffness, and matrix permeability were also investigated. Strong proppant is highly recommended for natural fractures, and hydraulic fracture near well bore especially for tight formations. Small chock size (high BHP) is also recommended during early production. Additionally, a simple analytical model is provided, accoding to the parametrical studies, for operating well without breaking proppant pack.|","Parametrical Studay, Proppant Crushing, Fracture conductivity, Proppant deformation"

It is estimated that only one third of the remaining worldwide oil and gas reserves are conventional, the remainder being in unconventional reservoirs whose evaluation requires appropriate measurements delivered in a cost-effective way. In the case of shales and other tight reservoirs, the defining characteristics are low matrix porosity and low or ultra-low permeability which requires artificial stimulation to encourage production. The optimum stimulation strategy for a particular reservoir is strongly dependent on the distribution of organic material, and on the mechanical and geometrical properties of the rock, and the associated stress field. It is essential to quantify these to an appropriate level of certainty, and well logs are the primary source of such data. Until recently the options for acquiring appropriate logs in high angle and horizontal wells have been constrained either by the limited available sensors or tool conveyance methods.

The geological complexities of shale formations dominated by lamination deposition mechanisms make formation evaluation a challenge for hydraulic fracture operations. Logging While Drilling technologies have evolved to provide valuable information for a reliable approach in anisotropic shales. One of the most frequent considerations is well productivity and how the new technologies and evaluation methods can help to mitigate the uncertainty of the completion and improve fracturing performance. The incorporation of the TIV anisotropy evaluation from LWD azimuthal acoustic measurements can help characterize the impact of the laminations stage by stage or even a more detailed cluster by cluster analysis. 
Information from the LWD azimuthal sonic tool can help provide a better understanding in regards to the rock mechanical behavior in horizontal shale wells, as well as the brittleness interpretation providing a more realistic approach to the lamination structure of the shale deposition. Quantifying TIV anisotropy is a very important key evaluation factor to optimize the completion program likewise the well productivity. In conjunction with the LWD azimuthal sonic information, the LWD spectral gamma ray measures isotope concentrations (such as Uranium, Potassium, and Thorium) can be confidently integrated into the unconventional petrophysical interpretation calculations of Total Organic Content. This analysis is incorporated with the geomechanical and anisotropy evaluation to select the best fracture placement and design in an unconventional environment. 
The anisotropic brittleness analysis identifies the zones where the best fracture propagation will be achieved while the petrophysical analysis indicates how productive these fractures should be. Through the geometric fracture simulation the best set of recommendations for the fracturing operation are developed to predict the conductivity area which contributes to the well productivity. 
This paper will show the impact of the TIV anisotropy into the geomechanical evaluation, beginning with the unique real-time fracture placement methodology leading to an optimization of the anisotropy analysis to generate the best frac design to avoid expensive completion programs and reduce uncertainty on fracture placement evaluation.|","Anisotropy, fracturing, completion, LWD Azimuthal Spectra Gamma Ray, LWD Azimuthal Sonic"

Multiple hydraulic fracturing is a proven stimulation technique to improve hydrocarbon production especially in tight, unconventional hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs. A two dimensional (2D) plane strain model, based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), has been developed to study multiple fracture propagation and their impact on reactivation of underground discontinuities such as faults. New model solves coupled non-local relationship between fracture width and net pressure in the fracture and non-linear dependence of fluid flow on fracture width and its linear dependence on pressure gradient using finite element method.

It is found that the number of hydraulic fractures and their spacing significantly impacts fractures geometry and ultimately production performance. The impact found to be more pronounced in heterogeneous reservoir with multiple layers.

Numerical simulation models that are used for well stimulation planning are usually complex and are prone to error. These models have many factors that generally contain uncertainty which, in turn, lead to uncertainty in the model outputs. Uncertainty assessment (UA) can describe such uncertainties in the modeling results. It is always important to the future development plans that uncertainty be properly assessed. 
This paper presents an approach to the uncertainty assessment of simulation models used for the design optimization of hydraulic fracturing. The use of numerical simulation in petroleum engineering, and the presence of uncertainty in all aspects of design and modeling, may lead to questions such as: What confidence do we have in model results? What are the limits in terms of applicability of model results? Uncertainty assessment together with sensitivity analysis can provide the answers to such questions. The Monte Carlo simulation is employed for implementing such analyses that includes repeated random sampling from input probability distributions. 
In the assessment of uncertainty conducted for the Bakken case study discussed in this paper, the following seven-step procedure is implemented: describing assessment goals, describing assumptions and constraints, describing parameters and outputs, classifying factor uncertainty, conducting the sensitivity analysis, conducting the uncertainty assessment, and presenting the results with probability curves. The main goal of this study is to present the use of probabilistic modeling for assessing the uncertainties in the simulation of hydraulic fracturing and reservoir performance. Such probabilistic modeling can also help us to develop proxy models for approximating outputs at un-simulated points and to demonstrate the simulation results with probability distribution curves.|","Uncertainty Assessment, simulation, probabilistic modeling, hydraulic fracturing, Bakken"

Hydraulic fracturing has increased immensely in recent years. An accurate prediction of frictional pressure losses of fracturing slurries is crucial for successful treatment and to avoid premature screen-out or even treatment failure. Scarce data and lack of theoretical basis of slurry flow, especially in coiled tubing has led to very limited number of correlations that are available to predict slurry frictional pressure losses. Yet, the accuracy of the available correlations is still questionable. 
The current paper presents a statistical comparative analysis of the available frictional pressure losses correlations for slurry flow in straight and coiled tubing employing the recently introduced math modeling technique that gives weight for the models known as Akaike information criterion, AIC. With the help of AIC, the authors evaluated the available correlations to examine their accuracy. The results show that none of the available correlations can accurately predict friction pressure losses of slurries. The correlations show some reasonable accuracy within a very limited data range. However, they fail outside this range indicative of their poor applicability. AIC shows how much information is lost when using these correlations which can lead to erroneous results, and even job failure. This fact keeps the gates widely opened for more in-depth experimental, analytical, and theoretical analysis for better understanding of flow behavior of fracturing slurries aiming at developing a more realistic correlation to predict their frictional pressure losses. This paper represents the authors' first step toward developing such correlation, with the application of information theory and AIC.|","Slurry, Friction, Coiled Tubing, Infromation Theory, Multiplayer"

The premise of classical hydraulic fracture breakdown models is that hydraulic fracture growth can only commence when the wellbore pressure reaches a critical value, sufficient to overcome the tensile strength of the rock. However, rocks are well-known to exhibit static fatigue, that is, delayed failure at stresses below the tensile strength. In this paper we explore the consequences of delayed failure on initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures. Specifically, given a certain breakdown pressure, we investigate the conditions under which subsequent hydraulic fracture(s) can initiate within the timeframe of a stimulation treatment in regions of higher stress and/or strength due to delayed failure mechanisms. The results show that wells completed in shallower formations are more sensitive to variations in strength while wells completed in deeper formations are more sensitive to variations in stress. Furthermore, cases in which all hydraulic fractures breakdown according to the same pressurization regime, that is, all are ""fast"" (non-fluid-penetrating) pressurization or else all are ""slow"" (fluid-penetrating) pressurization cases, are highly sensitive to small stress/strength variability. On the other hand, if the first hydraulic fracture initiation is in the ""fast"" pressurization regime and subsequent fracture(s) are in the ""slow"" pressurization regime, then the system is robust to a much higher degree of variability in stress/strength. Practically, this work implies that methods aimed at moderately reducing the variability in stress/strength among the possible initiation points (i.e. perforation clusters) within a particular stage can have a strong impact on whether multiple hydraulic fractures will initiate. Additionally, this analysis implies that pumping strategies that encourage ""fast"", non-penetrative breakdown of the first initiation point followed by the opportunity for fluid-penetrating, ""slow"" breakdown of subsequent initiation points could be highly effective at encouraging multiple hydraulic fracture initiation.|","Fracture Initiation, Fracture Modeling, Horizontal Well Completions, Multiple Fracture Growth, Hydraulic Fracturing"

The most effective method for stimulating unconventional reservoirs is using properly designed and successfully implemented hydraulic fracture treatments. The interaction between pre-existing natural fractures and the engineered propagating hydraulic fracture is a critical factor affecting the complex fracture network. However, many existing numerical simulators use simplified model to either ignore or not fully consider the significant impact of pre-existing fractures on hydraulic fracture propagation. Pursuing development of numerical models that can accurately characterize propagation of hydraulic fractures in naturally fractured formations is important to better understand their behavior and optimize their performance. 
In this paper, an innovative and efficient modeling approach was developed and implemented which enabled integrated simulation of hydraulic fracture network propagation, interactions between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing natural fractures, fracture fluid leakoff and fluid flow in reservoir. This improves stability and convergence, and increases accuracy, and computational speed. Computing time of one stage treatment with a personal computer is now reduced to 2.2 minutes from 12.5 minutes than using single porosity model. 
Parametric studies were then conducted to quantify the effect of horizontal differential stress, natural fracture spacing (the density of pre-existing fractures), matrix permeability and fracture fluid viscosity on the geometry of the hydraulic fracture network. Using the knowledge learned from the parametric studies, the fracture-reservoir contact area is investigated and the method to increase this factor is suggested.

An integrated unconventional reservoir model that accounts for known mechanisms and nonlinearities affecting modeling of hydraulically fractured wells is developed. In general, modeling and simulation of multi-fractured reservoirs are highly challenging due to the complexity attributed to the flow in this very low permeability and dense structured rock. Pressure- dependent phenomena in reservoir modeling are considered as combined hydraulic and natural fracture conductivity losses, desorption, Klinkenberg gas slippage effect and non-Darcy flow. Integrating these phenomena and analyzing the importance of each parameter in a reservoir model are essential. 
The proposed model includes three zones, Rock Matrix (I), Induced-Fracture (II) and Hydraulic Fracture (III) that are defined with different characteristics. Pressure dependent permeability is considered for zone II and III, with an exponential relationship between permeability and reservoir pressure. Governing equations of gas flow are non-linear partial differential equations, for all three zones, due to incorporated pressure-dependent phenomena that are solved using the finite difference method. A synthetic case is defined in order to investigate the effect of each individual phenomenon on long-term production. Moreover, a history matching process with Marcellus Shale field production data is performed in order to obtain the most uncertain parameters in the model. 
Results showed that combined effect of permeability losses of hydraulic and induced-fracture zones results in 15 percent gas production drop in 30 years. Also, it is observed that Klinkenberg effect and non-Darcy flow have insignificant effect on the modeling of shale gas reservoirs, whereas desorption has great contribution on long-term production. It is concluded that the minimum ingredients for an accurate shale reservoir modeling are considering gas desorption phenomena alongside with pressure-dependent permeability for the hydraulic and induced-fractures network. Our simple reservoir modeling approach helps in understanding complex behavior of flow mechanisms in shale plays. Also, this integrated model can be used during optimization of key factors in hydraulic fracturing process and fracture characterization by history matching of production.|","Unconventional assets, Numerical methods, Reservoir mdoeling, Pressure-dependent phenomena, Hydraulic fracturing"

In this paper the analysis of production data from shale gas wells will be considered and a workflow for the treatment of such data will be described.  The methodology is based on a mechanistic model of a horizontal well with multiple  hydraulic  fractures and the data is analysed in terms of an average fracture half length, xf,  an enhanced  reservoir permeability, k,  and  the generated stimulated reservoir volume (SRV).  Once the analytical model has been fitted to the measured pressure-rate data an advanced forecast, based on specified scenarios for the flowing bottom-hole pressure  (or the wellhead  pressure), is made which can be used to compute the expected ultimate recovery (EUR) over a given time frame.  The integration with other sources of information commences with a review of the fracture design which will have been carried out on specialist software using rock mechanics data from acoustic logs and minifracs.  The comparison of the measured transient productivity index for linear flow with that based on the fracture design parameters allows a rigorous assessment of the efficiency of the stimulation treatment.  The effect of stress on formation permeability can be an important issue in the understanding of shale gas wells and an optimised choke setting strategy will be required if the effect is significant.  It is shown how repeated well shut-ins (termed investigative build-ups) can be used to identify the stress effect and calibrate an appropriate geomechanics model such as the one proposed by Palmer and Mansoori.  The mechanistic software can then predict future production including the observed stress effect.  A new concept of pressure dependent skin is also introduced to model the deterioration of the conductivity of the major hydraulic fractures.|","Rate Decline, Parameter Estimatiom, Minifrac, Shale Gas, Production Data"

Shale plays have created the current natural gas boom in the United States (US) and according to the national Energy Information Administration (EIA, 2013) produced 47% of total daily productinon by the end of 2013 (approximatelty 31.8 Bscf/d). Extensive production data from thousands of wells are now available for analysis to provide potential benchmark information for the Australian shale gas industry, which is still in its infancy. 
This paper focuses on analysis of publicly available US production data from horizontal wells in five depositional basins reported for the Barnett, Eagle Ford, Fayetteville, and Haynesville shale plays. Type-wells are evaluated which allow estimation of a range of representative initial gas production ratee and technical Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) characteristics. The analysis also results in generc recommendations for the minimum sample size and duration required for statistically significant well appraisal programs in shale p[lays. Such activity phases' primary objective should be to efficiently obtain reasonably reliable type-well performance indicators. The US shale plays' experiences to date provide insight concerning this aspect. 
Variability in geological factors including, but not limited to: stress regime, total organic content, thermal maturity, porosity, brittleness, natural fractures, and reservoir pressure can result in production performance that differs substantially both within and between shale plays. Also affecting performance is how the wells are completed. The geology of shale formations is discussed along with recent Australian operational activity, geomechanicals considerations, and example economics. Analyses of the US data provide potential technical and economic benchmarks for preliminary comparisons to be made with Australian information, and may help to demonstrate the economic resilience required for exploitaton of prospective shale gas resources. 
However, it must be recognised that the likely performance characteristics of the prospective Australian shale plays' type-wells are not currently well understood due to lack of data.

Abstract 
Achimov deposits extend over 12,000 square kilometers around the city of Novy Urengoy. These deposits are characterized by high reservoir pressures, and a narrow range of drilling fluid densities that creates complicated conditions for drilling and completion of wells. Due to the high accident rate of drilling horizontal wells only S-shape wells were drilled for this formation. 
The first successful horizontal production well was drilled in 2013 in cooperation Arcticgaz, ERIELL, Schlumberger. The first well to drill a horizontal wellbore on Achimov formation, has been planned to open Ach3,4 and Ach5 layers of Achimov formation. 
In close cooperation with project operator - Arcticgaz company, engineering group of Schlumberger drilling contractor and drilling contractor  developed and successfully implemented comprehensive solutions for drilling and completion of horizontal wells Achim. One of the key factors of success was the use of drilling muds Megadril-D with constant control of equivalent circulating density. Application of rotary steareable system with optimally balanced PDC bits, allowed to drill horizontal wells through Achimov deposits in record time. 
An additional factor for drilling risks reduction was implementation of geomechanic model, as in the preparation of the preliminary model and real-time control for wellbore stability with the latest technology logging measurements (LWD)  acoustic and density neutron formation properties . 
In the period for 2013 to the 2nd quarter of 2014 have been successfully constructed more than 10 similar wells. Esteblished new records: maximum closure  2403 meters, the length of the longest subhorizontal section reached 1233 meters. Set a record duration of well construction time of 62 days vs 100 planned, which could not been reached before by anyone in the region (formerly similar wells with shorter intervals of subhorizontal sectionhave been constructed in evarage about 150 days).

Reliable quantitative data on UCS can only be derived at specific depths from laboratory tests on core samples, typically through destructive tests. Rock strength evaluation is primarily based on well log strength indicators, calibrated where possible against limited measurements on cores. 
A number of techniques have been developed to supplement plug-based destructive tests to indicate the rocks strength. Scratch and Schmidt hammer tests are examples of such techniques with the ability to provide continuous or semi-continuous, fine-scale measurements of rock mechanical properties. Both of these index tests are non-destructive; do not cause significant damage to the core and no special core preparation is required prior testing. 
In this paper we examine laboratory test results from both conventional triaxial testing on plugs and semi-continuous, non-destructive, index testing along core sections in conjunction with well log calibration, for a range of rocks from oil wells in different geological settings. The rocks represent a range of strengths from very weak to very strong (competent) rocks with UCS ranging between 1 and100 MPa. We show that the use of generalized (global) correlations of index testing versus UCS may provide reasonable estimates, however a local calibration based on triaxial tests would still be required for more accurate UCS profiling. Once calibrated to a few conventional plug tests, the continuous index test results can be correlated with petrophysical logs to generate a reliable strength log, coupled with sedimentological and diagenetic classification. 
We show that besides the direct application to geomechanical evaluation, the index tests can be used as a screening tool to optimize plug sampling to characterize the range of heterogeneity of the cored interval and also for filling the gaps in the core strength data where plugging is practically impossible or difficult, due to natural or coring-induced reasons.|","rock strength, non-destructive, rock mechanics, well logs, core test"

Producing tight oil reservoirs by hydraulic fracturing is especially challenging due to relatively low oil mobility. At the planning stage, an integrated approach is essential to optimise fracture parameters using a reliable geomechanical model and reliable reservoir simulations to predict the post-fracture productivity and the net present value (NPV). This paper presents such an integrated case study. The reservoir contained relatively clean sandstones interlaying only a few thin shale layers. A relatively low recovery was expected to yield a good positive NPV because production was planned using a nearby existing production facility. 
A geomechanical model was built using core, well log and drilling data characterizing the in situ stress, pore pressure and rock mechanical properties in the field. The reservoir properties were characterized from core-log calibration and PVT data from analogue reservoirs. The initial reservoir pressure was very close to the bubble point pressure. Thus, multiphase reservoir simulations were essential to predicting post-fracture production profiles. 
The study integrated geomechanical modeling, hydraulic fracturing design, reservoir simulations and economic assessments to investigate various well completion scenarios. Various scenarios included a single vertical fracture in a deviated well, an un-fractured 1,000 m horizontal openhole well and a 1,000 m horizontal well with multiple transverse fractures. The un-fractured horizontal openhole scenario required a life cycle wellbore stability assessment. The fractured horizontal well scenario required the optimisation of transverse fractures and their spacing. The production constraints included a 600 psi tubing head pressure, a maximum oil flow rate of 5,000 bbl/d and a maximum 5-year production period with preference for more accelerated recovery.  
The results from this integrated scheme enabled understanding of the impact of various well completion scenarios on decision-making based on technical and economic issues. The lessons learned in the study can be a guide for optimal development of the target field and other similar fields. 
Introduction 
This field is within the Nam Con Son basin offshore Vietnam. It is a tertiary basin in the Southern China Sea. The comprehensive geologic evolution of this basin is presented by Lee et al. (2001). The basin is generally gas bearing, however, the deeper clastic sequence is oil bearing. 
The prospect in the field was identified by 2D and 3D seismic acquisition, processing and interpretation. Several exploration and appraisal wells confirmed and characterized the prospect. The effort was subsequently focused on reservoir characterization, drilling and completion planning and production forecasting for decision-making using the net present value (NPV). The objective of this paper is to present the geomechanical modeling for future well drilling, its integration with hydraulic fracturing optimisation and production forecasting to assess the potential NPV taking into account various logistical and production constraints such as proppant and fluid storage capacity in the offshore fracture service vessel, tubing head pressure during production and production period.|","Integrated Optimisation, Production Prediction, Geomechanics, Net Present Value, Hydraulic Fracture"

Image logs are a key tool in understanding unconventional reservoirs, providing geomechanical information and characterisation of natural fractures.  This information can prove crucial in completion design and optimising production, especially where hydraulic stimulation is considered.  
Image log datasets associated with unconventional developments can be large, utilise a variety of different tool types and contain data across multiple vintages.  The size of the datasets requires multiple interpreters to facilitate interpretation in a reasonable time frame, while the different tool types require an interpretation scheme that is effective for image logs of different types.  These factors necessitate a rigorous quality assurance system to ensure the data quality, and consistency of interpretation across multiple interpreters and tool types to maximise the utility of the interpretation results. 
This paper presents a workflow for assessing large image log datasets practically derived from assessment of large datasets from multiple unconventional and conventional assets as applied to large Australian unconventional assets. Key elements of this workflow include: 
A tool independent quality control checklist that can be applied prior to interpretation. |Classification of image quality with respect to image log type. |Classification system for coal bed methane cleat characterisation of coals. |Classification system for fracture characterisation independent of tool type. |Classification system for stress related deformation independent of tool type. |A post interpretation quality control checklist to ensure consistency between multiple interpreters. 
Introduction 
The drive to increase reserves and production has lead to more and more unconventional play types being developed with an ever increasing number of projects.   Unconventional play types typically require a large number of wells due to the smaller drainage areas for each individual well (Holditch, 2006). These wells need to be placed and completed in the optimal manner to maximize production rates and recovery.  The state of stress, the mechanical rock properties and the exisitence of pre-existing fracture networks all provid key information for well placement and completion strategy (Holditch, 2006).  This has lead to significant numbers of image logs being acquired in the unconventional plays.  For example two significant projects in Queensland Australia are planning to drill large numbers of wells. The QCLNG Project plans to drill 6000 wells over the life of the project (QGC, 2012) while the GLNG project is planning to drill upto 6100 wells during the life of the project (Santos, 2013).  It is expected that a significant proportion of these wells will have image logs.  Even if the proportion is small, the number of image logs is large.|","Image Log, Unconventional, Geomechanics"

Hydraulic fracturing is a key technology to developing unconventional resources. At the planning stage, the prediction of production profiles in the presence of designed hydraulic fractures in the reservoir model is very important. Various analytical methods available are inadequate to produce reliable production profiles by accurately modeling irregular reservoir shape, permeability heterogeneity, multiphase flow and the presence of natural fractures. Any standard reservoir simulator facilitates these modeling features; the key challenge is, however, to model the propped hydraulic fractures accurately in the reservoir. Techniques such as negative skin, equivalent well radius and a uniform conductivity rectangular fracture are common built-in features in almost all available reservoir simulators. The imperative questions are (1) how good are these techniques to reliably model the flow through a non-rectangular fracture having non-uniform conductivity, and (2) how to model the combination of propped hydraulic fractures and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) in the presence of stimulated natural fractures? This paper presents the results from two case studies that reveal the shortcomings and simulation difficulties with negative skin, equivalent wellbore radius and uniform conductivity rectangular fractures. The paper also presents improved techniques to model propped hydraulic fractures with nonuniform conductivity in nonrectangular geometry (as usually designed) and SRV in the reservoir model for reservoir simulations. The comparison of results and discussion of various techniques are expected to enable engineers to understand why in certain conditions built-in features may not be possible to use because of numerical instabilities during simulation, and the range of variations in prediction from various techniques. The improved technique presented in this paper, which is based on a local grid refinement technique, can provide more reliable production prediction and can overcome numerical instabilities (though it is generally more computation intensive). 
Introduction 
Hydraulic fracturing technology is in increased demand to develop unconventional resources such as tight clastic, shale and coal seams reservoirs. At the decision-making stage, predicting the production profile in the presence of hydraulic fractures is the key to the development of unconventional resources. There are simplified analytical methods that can seldom model the complexity of a real production system: irregular reservoir shape, reservoir heterogeneity, multiphase flow, natural fractures, multiple transverse fractures, irregular fracture conductivity and various production constraints. Modeling hydraulically stimulated shale reservoirs is more complex and requires the modeling of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) by incorporating the stimulated (permeability enhanced) natural fractures in addition to the created hydraulic fracture. 
The above-mentioned complexities can be managed, to some extent, in reservoir simulation software that predicts the production profile from a hydraulically fractured reservoir. The reliability of such simulation results is, however, heavily dependent upon the specialized skills and expertise of the modeler on how to model more realistic hydraulic fractures, and if applicable, the stimulated natural fractures in the reservoir model. Various techniques of hydraulic fracturing modeling coupled with reservoir simulations were recently published (Weill and Latil, 1992; Dean and Schmidt, 2008; Ji et al., 2009; Bogachev and Shelkov, 2010). However, some of the methods are not readily available or user friendly in the design environment and others are based on certain assumptions within which the above discussed modeling complexities can not be integrated. The key objectives of this paper are, therefore, to present a technique for modeling hydraulic fractures in the commercially available reservoir simulators as close to the designed fracture(s) as possible (Fig. 1), and to investigate the effects of deviation from it on production prediction by other techniques. |","Production Prediction, Hydraulic Fracture, Reservoir Simulation"

Arrow Energy has engaged in drilling production Coal Bed Methane (CBM) wells in the Bowen Basin. As part of its field development strategy, varied styles of horizontal wells have been planned and executed along the coal targets of Moranbah Coal Measures (MCM). Some of the recently drilled multi-branch lateral and horizontal wells experienced different drilling challenges and production performance. Potential geomechanical issues such as borehole conditions and fines/solid production are directly related to wellbore stability during and post drilling. 
As part of Arrow subsurface modeling strategy, the project has embarked a detailed Geomechanics study in Moranbah Gas field. The main objectives were aiming to: (i) optimize the mud weight that is required to stabilize the borehole, (ii) understand how specific coal targets respond to the induced stress concentration around the wellbore during drilling and, (iii) capture the vertical and lateral mechanical heterogeneity within specific coal seams. This paper focuses on practical solutions to model the borehole stability, in particular of the uncertainties in the rock strength modeling and coal heterogeneity. 
This innovative workflow coupled with geostatistical approach of rock strength and insitu stress with depth-of-damage is first of its kind in CBM environment. Borehole collapse depth-of-damage (DoD) concept is then used to assess risk associated to the volume of yielded rock as a percent of borehole size. The higher the percentage of DoD, the higher the risk of producing excessive cavings. It provides more confidence in optimizing drilling mud weight for CBM horizontal wells by allowing a more scientifically-sound and practical solution to address rock failure mechanisms associated with borehole instability. 
Introduction 
Arrow Energy has been extensively producing coalbed methane (CBM) from fields in the Bowen basin in central Queensland and the Surat basin in southern Queensland. One of Arrows main coal targets in the Bowen Basin is the Moranbah Coal Measures (MCM) of late Permian Age (Fig. 1). The MCM is part of the Blackwater group, and it is best developed along the western margin of the northern Bowen basin. The MCM contains multiple coal seams generally ranging in thickness from 2 to 5 m but up to 10 m in some areas, with cumulative thickness of up to 25 m. A typical log profile and coal properties in the MCM are shown in Fig. 2. The MCM seams exhibit favorable CBM reservoir properties with wells yielding good production rates through surface-to-inseam drilling and hydraulic fracturing completion techniques. 
As part of the fields development strategy, varied styles of horizontal wells have been planned and executed along the coal targets of MCM. Some of the recently drilled multibranch lateral and horizontal wells experienced different drilling challenges and production performance. Potential geomechanical issues such as borehole collapse, drilling challenges, and fines/solid production are directly related to wellbore stability during and after drilling.|","wellbore stability, CSG, CBM, coal strength"

In 2013, Armour Energy commenced evaluation of conventional and unconventional gas reservoirs within the Paleoproterozoic (Pre-Cambrian) Supersequences within the Isa Superbasin, North Queensland, Australia. In 2012, a vertical well with a sidetracked lateral was drilled targeting the Lawn Hill Shale Member (Lawn), offsetting the 1990s Egilabria 1 well, which exhibited gas shows in the same interval. 
Egilabria 2 was the first recent vertical well in the area, which was subsequently sidetracked to create a 567m lateral wellbore, Egilabria 2 DW1. Egilabria 2 exhibited gas shows and flows whilst underbalanced air-drilling across Wide, Doom and Lawn Supersequences. An extensive set of logs and cuttings data were collected in Egilabria 2 aiding targeting and geologic correlation in the sidetracked lateral. 
Egilabria 2 DW1 lateral was drilled, cased, cemented, and a multi-stage plug-and-perf style of frac treatment was employed. Before shutting in the well post-frac for an extended buildup, during the inaccessible wet season in this area, frac fluid was flowing back unassisted and gas was flaring at low surface flowing pressures. This was the first successful, post-frac gas flows from a multistage, fracture stimulated, laterally drilled, shale gas well in Australia. 
This paper details the data collected in the vertical pilot well and observations and implications of in situ stress magnitudes and varying natural fracturing azimuths had on the drilling and subsequent hydraulic fracturing treatment of the lateral wellbore. In addition, we will present our recommendations for future well targeting and treatment strategies for this area and recommendations for shale gas exploration and appraisal in other frontier basins. 
Background 
The Paleoproterozoic Isa Superbasin (1780Ma to 1550Ma) is located in northwest Queensland and in the northeast of the Northern Territory of the Western Fold Belt Province of the Mount Isa Orogen, Australia (see Fig. 1). Detailed summaries of the geology of the area were given by Blake et al., (1987, 1990 and 1992),1,2,3 definition, structure and petroleum geology are compiled by McConachie et al (1993)4 and more recent geological summaries by the Queensland Department of Mines and Energy and Queensland Geological Survey (2000-2010).5 The Mount Isa Basin (McConachie et al, 1993) is approximately 7200 km<U+00B2>. A vast portion of the basin is covered by intracratonic sediments of the South Nicholson (1580Ma-1430Ma), Georgina (850Ma-355Ma) and Carpentaria Basins (205Ma-65Ma), bounded in the north by the Murphy Inlier basement complex (1870Ma-1840M) and to the south the complex Elizabeth Creek thrust belt (1640Ma-1590Ma). Dating of basin phases in the Western Fold Belt and their implication for basin development was reported by Page & Sweet (1998).6|","fracturing, australia, geomechanics, shalegas, pre-cambrian"

Newly acquired full azimuth 3D seismic in conjunction with modern azimuthal acquisition and processing, and a fresh review of the regional structural model, has enabled the identification of strike-slip faults with greater certainty. Strike-slip faults are often difficult to identify in traditionally processed seismic due to the lack of vertical displacement. The resulting improvement in structural detail in the geological models has provided a better match with well production, performance and reservoir connectivity in mature Cooper Basin fields. The structural interpretation is independently supported by Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA) and image log data in one of the fields. 
Field examples are used to demonstrate the observed relationship between strike-slip faulting and hydrodynamic connection. Pressure data supports that fields previously thought to be separate are demonstrated to be connected via strike-slip corridors. Therefore, hydrodynamic disconnect occurs across strike-slip faults. An observed relationship between underperforming wells and proximity to interpreted strike-slip faults is also discussed. 
The integrated approach combining new full azimuth 3D seismic data with regional structural concepts, well performance and dynamic behaviour has led to the identification of new development and appraisal opportunities in several mature fields. Application of this multidisciplinary approach, including the structural model, seismic interpretation and analysis of dynamic data is recommended for all fields throughout the Cooper Basin with suitable full azimuth seismic data. This process should be embedded in future field development plans. 
Introduction 
Fields A and B are located within the Patchawarra Trough, NW of a major discontinuity in the Gidgealpa-Merrimelia-Innamincka (GMI) trend (Fig. 1). It is noted that in fields A and B some wells have significantly poorer performance than other wells in these fields. Previously, the structural interpretation was based on relatively sparse (approximately 500 m) spaced 2D seismic lines resulting in poorly defined structural closure and separation between the two fields. For future development of these fields, full azimuth 3D seismic was acquired and interpreted. During the interpretation, a robust structural concept was applied to ensure consistency with the regional model.  This structural concept makes reference to the principle paleo-stress orientation and incorporates analogous sand box models. In this part of the Cooper basin, fields are interpreted as pop-up structures with their genesis in the transfer zones of strike-slip or wrench faults. 
The identification of strike-slip faults in seismic data is not straight forward as these features often have no vertical displacement thus making conventional interpretation in 2D vertical sections difficult.  The authors found that seismic interpretation of strike-slip faults was made easier by identifying them in horizontal time slices in addition to observing similar features on structural maps using attributes like minimum curvature.  Full azimuth seismic data has also been analysed and confirms the interpretation. 
The well production data in fields A and B was compared and the poorer performing wells identified. When their geographical location was then identified with respect to the newly interpreted faults, it was apparent that wells closer to strike-slip faults had significantly poorer performance.|","Strike-Slip, Azimuthal Seismic, fault damage mechanisms, Cooper Basin, well performance"

Abstract 
This work is devoted to the solution of the problem of well drilling on the sediments of the Devonian system known to lots of the world and Russian oil-and-gas regions. The well drilling on the Devonian sediments, especially with the horizontal borehole, is difficult due to the lithological composition and peculiar geomechanic properties of the clay formations composing the drilling intervals. This work covers the approach to solving the problem of keeping the Devonian sediments stability, starting from the integrated study of core of the problem intervals through the end of the testing of the developed technology concepts. 
Hydrocarbon-based muds and relating invert emulsions are concerned to be unsurpassed in terms of keeping borehole stability, nevertheless they have got some disadvantages concerning the significant change in their structure-rheological properties during the change in thermobaric conditions. The solution of the stated problems is in the usage of the reagent, described in this report, which is aimed to regulate the rheological profile of the system under high bottom-hole temperature conditions. Due to the nano-size of the polymer particles, contained in the reagent, the filter cake is formed to colmatage micropores and microfractures in the formations as well as to prevent their spread. 
The work covers the results of the practical-field testing of the improved invert-emulsion drilling mud formula at Kharyaginskoe oilfield. The leading foreign service company that conducted the drilling mud during the building of the horizontal wells at this oilfield before, has faced the problem connected with the loss of bore hole walls stability while opening the Devonian sediments at the zenith angles more than 60 degrees. The use of the drilling mud formula, presented in the report, has given the opportunity to avoid the problems stated above. 
The field testing results, presented in the report, can be useful for the choice and reasoning of the drilling mud formula while constructing horizontal wells on the Devonian sediments by other companies especially those of them working in the Komi Republic and in the Nenets Autonomous District.|","Document Type

Recent molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation of methane flow through nanoscale kaolinite channel shows that the gas molecules accumulate near the kaolinite wall, which will reduce the flowpath of the gas through tight porous media. Considering this gas-accumulation effect, and on the basis of the corrected second-order slip boundary condition (BC) proposed by Zhang et al. (2010), a permeability-correlation model is proposed for nanoscale flow in highly compacted shale reservoirs. Full-derivation detail of this model is presented along with a comparison with several existing correlations. Results show that, with the increase of the Knudsen number (Kn), the molecular-accumulation effect has an obvious negative effect on the shale permeability, which should not be neglected in further investigation. The parametric investigation of the model proposed shows that the permeability is mostly decided by the pore-wall structure of shale matrix and only slightly influenced by the gas property.|","Molecule Accumulation, Apparent permeability, Slip Flow Regime, Second-order slip boundary"

Core studies have revealed the presence of abundant cemented microfractures in many tight formations. Further independent studies have revealed the opening of some of these microfractures on the wall surface of main hydraulic fractures. In addition, early-production well-testing analysis in some of these cases provides estimates for the hydraulically-induced-fracture surface area, which is much larger than fracture dimensions estimated in fracturing design or provided by the location of microseismic events. Opening of small-sized fractures could be a possible reason for this discrepancy. In this paper, we show to what extent thermal stresses induced by temperature difference between fracturing fluid and formation fluid could provide the driving force to open a portion of these small, cemented natural fractures lying on the surface of hydraulic fractures. Moreover, through combination of stress analysis and empirical fracture-distribution models obtained from outcrops, we calculate the increase of total reservoir/fracture contact surface under the condition of microfracture activation. Our thermoelasticity analysis reveals the effect of the pump rate and temperature of the fracturing fluid on the number of activated microfractures. The results show that the volume of the microfractures varies depending on the length of the microfracture, rock properties, and time. At the end of the paper, through an example, we show that activation of only a small portion of these microfractures can increase the total fracture/formation contact area considerably and, consequently, increase initial production. Reservoir-pressure changes caused by production might partially close or reopen these microcracks during production; hence, the effectiveness of these microfractures could be mainly restricted to the early life of the reservoirs.|","microfractures, hydraulic fracturing, natural fractures, thermal stresses"

Accurate representation of near-well flow is an important subject matter in reservoir simulation. In todays field-scale reservoir simulation, cell-centered structured grids remain the predominant practice. Typically, well-inflow performance of the perforated cells is connected to the finite-volume solution by means of well indices that may not be well-defined when the wellbore intersects the finite-volume cells in a complex trajectory. Fine gridding is also required to resolve the flow dynamics in the near-well regions. Strong grid-orientation sensitivities can also contribute to the numerical errors and may require significant local grid refinement to alleviate. There are ongoing research-and-development (R&D) efforts on applying unstructured grids to better represent the near-well flow in reservoir simulation, but their applications are mainly in single-well study or sector modeling with a few wells. Some of the reasons cited for this include (1) the lack of an effective, easy-to-use full-field complex well-gridding tool; (2) the lack of supporting unstructured workflow for full-cycle reservoir simulation; (3) the cost of unstructured-grid simulation; and (4) the availability of post-analysis and visualization tools for unstructured-grid simulation. The paper describes a novel method to automatically generate unstructured grids that conform to complex wellpaths in field-scale simulation. The method uses a multilevel approach to place cells optimally within the solution domain on the basis of the ""regions of interests."" The wellbore geometry is honored by means of the construction of a near-well grid that is complemented with multilevel quad-tree (Fig. 1) refinements to achieve the desired resolution in grid transition zones. The method includes an algorithm to remove small cells and pinching cells on the basis of local grid quality measures and cell prioritization to honor wellpaths. The gridding process forms a component of a production-level reservoir-simulation workflow. The use of unstructured grid results in computational savings by placing cells where the resolution is needed. An in-house massively parallel simulator is used to run the unstructured-grid models. Simulation examples for full-field applications with hundreds of complex wells by use of both structured grids and unstructured grids will be used to compare results, accuracy, and performance of the gridding method for reservoir simulation.|","PEBI Voronoi grid, parallel reservoir simulation, Unstructured Gridding, Flow near Complex Wells"

Hydraulic fracturing is essential for the economic development of tight gas reservoirs and shale-gas reservoirs. Current techniques are unable to predict the stimulated-reservoir-volume (SRV) dependence on fracturing-job and rock-mechanics parameters, which precludes any meaningful optimization. In the authors previous work on the SRV-propagation prediction, the combined tensile/shear fracturing model applied to the fracturing of tight gas formations has shown the creation of a relatively narrow, focused SRV that resembled behavior dominated by a single fracture. In this work, the model has been significantly improved by the implementation of a rigorous full Newton elasto-plastic solution of the geomechanics of rock containing induced fractures. The results reveal interesting features of complex-fracture propagation in tight formations, which are in broad agreement with the shapes of SRVs obtained from microseismic imaging. The developed code is flexible enough to allow either tensile or shear fracturing or occurrence of both to be examined on the basis of initial reservoir conditions. Different cases of 2D and 3D simulations will be presented that demonstrate some important features of the process. First, it is found that a wide SRV can result in cases in which initial reservoir conditions are close to the shear-fracturing point, such as in formations with microfractures, partially cemented natural fractures, and abnormally high initial pore pressure. Second, the SRV width is found to depend on the horizontal stress contrast, as expected. Third, wide SRV growth is associated with constant or increasing pumping pressure necessary for further failed-zone growth as a result of the loss of elastic coupling by off-planar failure propagation. Further, under high injection pressure, an efficient fracture elasto-plastic constitutive model developed can drive both maximal and minimal effective stresses to zero or tensile, and, therefore, the creation of tensile fracturing can be predicted simultaneously with shear fracturing. This will then provide a means of modeling proppant transport. The new model is a significant step toward the development of an integrated predictive tool for the optimization of shale-gas development.|","Coupled Flow/Geomechanics Simulation, Tensile and Shear Fracture, Shale Gas, Hydraulic Fracturing"

Unconventional gas resources from tight-sand and shale gas reservoirs have received great attention in the past decade around the world because of their large reserves and technical advances in developing these resources. As a result of improved horizontal drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies, progress is being made toward commercial gas production from such reservoirs, as demonstrated in the US. However, understandings and technologies needed for the effective development of unconventional reservoirs are far behind the industry needs (e.g., gas-recovery rates from those unconventional resources remain very low). There are some efforts in the literature on how to model gas flow in shale gas reservoirs by use of various approaches - from modified commercial simulators to simplified analytical solutions - leading to limited success. Compared with conventional reservoirs, gas flow in ultralow-permeability unconventional reservoirs is subject to more nonlinear, coupled processes, including nonlinear adsorption/desorption, non-Darcy flow (at both high flow rate and low flow rate), strong rock/fluid interaction, and rock deformation within nanopores or microfractures, coexisting with complex flow geometry and multiscaled heterogeneity. Therefore, quantifying flow in unconventional gas reservoirs has been a significant challenge, and traditional representative-elementary-volume- (REV) based Darcy's law, for example, may not be generally applicable. In this paper, we discuss a generalized mathematical framework model and numerical approach for unconventional-gas-reservoir simulation. We present a unified framework model able to incorporate known mechanisms and processes for two-phase gas flow and transport in shale gas or tight gas formations. The model and numerical scheme are based on generalized flow models with unstructured grids. We discuss the numerical implementation of the mathematical model and show results of our model-verification effort. Specifically, we discuss a multidomain, multicontinuum concept for handling multiscaled heterogeneity and fractures [i.e., the use of hybrid modeling approaches to describe different types and scales of fractures or heterogeneous pores - from the explicit modeling of hydraulic fractures and the fracture network in stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) to distributed natural fractures, microfractures, and tight matrix]. We demonstrate model application to quantify hydraulic fractures and transient flow behavior in shale gas reservoirs.|","reservoir simulation, unconventional reservoir, tight gas, shale gas"

Instead of drilling and hydraulically fracturing one well at a time, the zipper method involves drilling multiple wells from a pad site and then hydraulically fracturing a stage in one well, while getting ready for the next, as wireline and perforation operations take place in another. The multiwell completion method earns its name from the zipper-like configuration of the fracture stages from wells drilled with relatively tight spacing. |This shaves days off the time it takes to complete a multiwell pad. Many companies in south Texas are now using the completion method on almost every new pad site they drill into, saving tens of millions of dollars per year while accelerating the development of their well inventories. |But the big prize may be that zipper fractures are increasing initial production and estimated ultimate recovery rates when designed so that the fractures stimulate the most reservoir volume possible. Tulsa-based WPX Energy, an independent operator of 160,000 acres in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, told investors this summer that when the company switched to zipper fracturing, it averaged 420 B/D of oil production compared with 388 B/D from single-well completions. While not entirely sure if zipper fracturing is the direct cause of improved production, WPX said it expects that is the case. Mukul Sharma, a professor and chair in the petroleum department at the University of Texas at Austin (UT), said field data from Eagle Ford wells make it clear to him that zipper fractures are indeed improving initial production rates and the estimated ultimate recovery. Sharma said operators in south Texas have reported improved initial production rates ranging from 20% to 40% using the zipper method. I would say that this is definitely the way people are going to be doing a lot of their fractures in the future, he said. What I think we need to do is understand better how it works why it works. Once we understand that, we can apply it much more efficiently.|","Document Type

This paper discusses the determination of in situ stress regime and its resulting impact on hydraulic fracture geometry through an analysis of two datasets that were acquired in a vertical well and a nearby horizontal well in a Canadian reservoir. The hydraulic fracture geometry monitored using microseismic was available for comparison. 
When solving the poro-elastic horizontal strain model for closure stress, using analogous Hookes Law for continuous media, one needs to resolve a stiffness tensor which requires determination of multi-dimensional shear. Measurements done in vertical wells using acoustic data are challenged by the limitation of not being able to directly record a horizontal shear. This limitation is typically overcome by modeling a horizontal shear using Stoneley mode firing. This well-developed technique works better when data is acquired using tools that allow simplified modeling of the tool wave, such as those tools that do not have slots cut in the housing to reduce direct signal coupling through the tool housing and mandrel. With the acquisition of simultaneous horizontal and vertical well data in the study, complementary information from the horizontal well provides a unique opportunity to physically confirm the validity of horizontal shear determined in the Vertical well, thereby providing further confidence in the modeling technique. 
The analysis showed approximately 7% acoustic wave anisotropy for both compressional and shear wave in this part of the reservoir. It also indicated both vertical and horizontal transverse isotropic anisotropy presence. This enabled confirming a particular stress regime.|","Stress, Microseismic, Geomechanics, Horizontal, Montney"

In the Upper and Lower Bakken shales, laminated shale structures exhibit variable mechanical properties depending on orientation relative to bedding planes, which can increase the likelihood of cement left-in-pipe events (CLIPs). CLIPs occur when cement fluids are not completely displaced from the casing during placement.  These incidents can be costly both in terms of well costs and non-productive time, with rates of approximately 2% of total wells drilled in the Williston basin at a USD 750,000 estimated costs to the operator per incident.  Experts in geomechanics, drilling fluids, and well integrity have collaborated to focus on the geomechanical factors associated with drilling the curved section through the Upper and Lower Bakken shales. 
A 3-year study of CLIPs and successfully completed offset wells was conducted to assess the roles of numerous contributing factors. Basin geomechanics, drilling practices, cuttings removal, and well cementing practices were evaluated for each of the cases and it has been determined that in-situ shale stresses have the greatest impact on wellbore stability and CLIP occurrence. Construction of Mechanical Earth (MEM) and wellbore stability (WBS) models for a typical Williston well suggests that several geomechanical factors contribute to successful cement placement.  
Introduction 
Cement left-in-pipe events (CLIPs) are the inability to complete displacement during a cement job, resulting in the cement being left inside of the casing preventing good zonal isolation, casing protection or wellbore integrity. The root cause for a CLIP event may be very simple with only a single contributing factor, or it may be very complex with a combination of variables at play. Factors that may influence CLIP occurrence include, but are not limited to, the quality of the cementitious slurry, wellbore conditions, engineering practices, underbalanced drilling practices, inefficient mud and cuttings removal, and lack of understanding of regional drilling challenges. 
A consistent trend of CLIPs in the Williston Basin has been observed over the past few years. A 2-year study over 2011 and 2012 included 19 CLIPs and comparable successful offset wells over the 2-year period. As of December 2013, the CLIP number had increased to a total of 33 CLIPs. The increase in drilling activity correlates directly with the increased number of CLIPs in the region. During this study, in 2011, 450 intermediate cement jobs were performed and 10 CLIPs occurred giving a 2.2% CLIP rate. In 2012, 545 intermediate cement jobs were performed and 9 CLIPs occurred, a CLIP rate of 1.7%. In 2013, 637 intermediate cement jobs were performed and 14 CLIPs occurred, a CLIP rate of 2.2%. Regardless of percentage occurrence, CLIP incidents can be costly both in terms of well costs and non-productive time, with a resulting cost of USD 750,000 per incident in the Williston basin. The average CLIP occurrence rate shown above extrapolated across all operators in the Williston basin results in approximately 40 CLIP incidents per year, which results in an additional USD 30,000,000 in additional to normal operating costs spent annually in the Williston basin for remediation costs of CLIPs. These remediation costs consist of a week of rig downtime, multiple wireline cement bond logs and perforations run, remedial squeeze cementing, and fracturing string costs.|","Bakken Shale, Mechanical Earth Model, Cement Left in Pipe (CLIP), Wellbore Stability"

It is well known that shale can be a problematic lithology that is capable of creating issues such as tight hole and pipe stuck during a drilling operation. Shale bedding is recognized as one of the key factors that directly contributes to drilling problems. This paper focuses on shale beddings impact on wellbore stability, which is investigated with the comparison of wellbore stability results of the shale formation with shale bedding and without shale bedding. The geomechanical simulation results show that: (1) the characteristics of wellbore stability polar plot for all well trajectories can be dramatically changed by shale bedding; (2) both well azimuth and well inclination have significant impact on wellbore stability; (3) stress dominated and shale bedding dominated wellbore breakouts can be evaluated; (4) formation strength control and shale bedding strength control wellbore stability are indentified. Based on those simulated wellbore stability characteristics, optimizations for well azimuth, well inclination, well trajectory, and mud weights can be designed for drilling operation to mitigate the potential drilling hazards. 
1. Introduction 
In order to develop subsurface oil or gas resources, a borehole is needed to be drilled to access the resource reservoirs. In subsurface formations, there are in-situ stresses which concentrate around the borehole when drilled. This geomechanics process of borehole stress concentration can result in various hazards and problems for drilling operations, such as tighthole, pipe-stuck, lost-circulation, etc.. Drilling operations are costly events and these geomechanics-related drilling problems worsen the situation with extra non-productive time. Especially in shale formation, it is well-known that many drilling problems take place. There are many shale formations in Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and they have caused significant drilling problems for the oil and gas drilling operation in this area. For shale formation, shale bedding has been identified as one of the key factors for drilling problems of wellbore instability caused by geomechanics. Based on western Canadian basin, this paper generates a generic geomechanics model to investigate the shale bedding impact on wellbore stability and its application to optimize drilling operation. 
2. Geomechanics Parameters 
2.1. In-situ stresses 
More than 10,000 wells have been drilled in Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and there are plentiful logs, drilling reports, well completion reports, and hydraulic fracturing stimulation data that can be used for in-situ stress constraints. Horizontal principal stress orientations are determined mainly by wellbore breakouts and drilling-induced hydraulic fractures. Minimum horizontal stress magnitudes are based on hydraulic fracturing curve analysis and leak-off tests in drilling operation. Maximum horizontal stress is constrained with geomechanics back analysis. Vertical stress gradients are calculated from bulk density logs. Formation pressure is referred to drilling daily logs. The in-situ stresses are summarized in Table 1 for the wellbore stability study in this paper.|","Drilling Hazards, Wellbore Stability, Geomechanics"

The opening and propagation of a hydraulic fracture introduces stress and pressure changes around it that could potentially lead to slippages of natural fractures. If detected, the associated microseismicity is commonly used to indirectly measure the geometry of the hydraulic fracture and the stimulated rock volume. One source of microseismicity is the fluid leakoff and pressure increase into the natural fractures. As pressure increases, the effective stress is reduced and shear failure of the natural fractures can be triggered. The natural fractures can also be reactivated in absence of leakoff due to the stress changes induced in the rock due to the opening of the hydraulic fracture itself and due to the inflation of the natural fractures intersected by the main hydraulic fracture. The volume in which stress changes alone can reactivate natural fractures is commonly thought to be small and localized near the hydraulic fracture tips. Yet, this paper shows that when the presence of natural fractures is explicitly taken into account, together with the potential propagation of further stress changes as the natural fractures slip, then such reactivated volume can be substantially larger. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of local stress heterogeneities in the potential generation of microseismicity and highlight how the local stress heterogeneity directly depends on the mechanical properties of the natural fractures.|","stress, unconventional, geomechanics, micro-seismicity, dry"

In hydraulic fracture treatment programs microseismic imaging is often used to determine geometrical dimensions of the fracture network. The geometrical dimensions can be measured using fracture lengths, widths, and heights, or as an estimation of the potential volume that will contribute to production typically referred to as the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). These SRV values are often used in reservoir models to plan and optimize a completion plan. Most techniques involve simply fitting a volume to these events.  However, microseismic events also provide information on the deformation, energy and stress release and other seismic parameters that can possibly be used to constrain and provide realistic SRV estimates. In this paper, we investigate how SRV values vary by comparing standard approaches, with values as calculated based on seismic deformation and by taking into account the source types and fracture orientations derived from Seismic Moment Tensor Inversion (SMTI) to define regions of Enhanced Fluid Flow (EFF), akin to SRV estimates for fracture networks with propped or opening components of failure. By using a representative microseismic dataset from a shale gas play in North America, differences in approach are considered, and we conclude that EFF derived SRV estimates are likely a better reflection and more accurate representation of potential yields and estimates of reservoir volume. 
Introduction and Background 
Microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing is becoming increasingly recognized as a technology that offers validation and feedback on the growth of stimulated volumes, either in real-time during pumping or through post analysis of the waveforms recorded on the sensor arrays deployed around the reservoir.  A key parameter that is commonly being determined from microseismic data is Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV).   In general, a common approach to estimate SRV is by measuring the length, width, and height of the overall event distribution either by stage or for the overall stimulation. Over the past decade, this approach has not really changed even though our physical understanding of the processes leading up to and associated with microseismicity has evolved, including the ability to estimate fracture size, failure types, event strength or deformation, and the energy and stress released by the generation of microseimic events. In this paper, we discuss three approaches of using microseismic data to determine SRV:  by the event distribution, by characterizing the total deformation associated with the event distributions, and by considering the spatial variability in failure type as derived through Seismic Moment Tensor Inversion (SMTI).  In the latter case, events expected to contribute to production are identified based on the interaction of fractures within an established discrete fracture network of shear-tensile opening events.  In general, the various approaches estimate SRV by enclosing isosurfaces, which allows fracture extents and volumes to be characterized geometrically and further used to optimize completion plans and well designs.|","microseismic, seismic deformation, stimulated reservoir volume, fracture dimensions, enhanced fluid flow"

With the development of unconventional shale and tight reservoirs, stimulation treatments that place multiple transverse fractures have received a greater attention in recent years. The post-frac productivity of such low-permeability reservoirs is largely determined by the matrix-fracture contact area with appropriate fracture conductivity. Although it is often anticipated that the fractures are infinitely conductive, the general belief is that the production increases with the proppant amount injected. 
This paper presents an approach to assess the optimum proppant amount injected by determining the post-frac conductivity. First, using three-dimensional finite difference reservoir simulations in a naturally fractured reservoir, which has both the hydraulic fracture and natural fractures modeled explicitly as discrete grid blocks, we find cumulative production as a function of fracture conductivity. For a fixed propped length and production time, we observe a critical conductivity beyond which the production is insensitive to the conductivity. The critical conductivity is then obtained as a function of the propped length and production time. The numerical results show that the critical conductivity increases with propped length and decreases with production time. The effect of stimulated natural fracture properties (intensity and permeability) on the critical conductivity is then investigated. For reservoirs with matrix permeability in the range 20-1000 nD, natural fractures increase the short-term critical conductivity but decrease the medium to long-term ones. The paper also evaluates the influence of water production, cluster spacing, and BHP flowing pressure on the critical conductivity. 
This study demonstrates that Agarwal type curves based on linear flow are not appropriate for naturally fractured reservoirs and lead to errors in estimation of critical conductivity. The results of this study can be useful for selecting the type and amount of proppant for stimulation of unconventional reservoirs. 
Introduction 
Recent advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have enabled economic production from North American shale and tight reservoirs. These include multi-stage fracturing using plug-and-perf method, use of slickwater as fracturing fluid and various completion tools. Due to low recovery factors and fast declining rates, well productivity in such low-permeability reservoirs is driven by the stimulation effectiveness to create a large matrix-fracture contact area. Therefore, optimizing the completions parameters (stage spacing, proppant and fluid type, open-hole vs. cemented etc.) has become an integral part of the field-development program. 
Shale reservoirs are complex, heterogeneous and often characterized by the presence of natural fractures, faults and planes of weakness. The interactions between hydraulic and natural fractures can lead to non-planar, complex fracture growths. However, such network growth is not fully understood and the field validation has been challenging. Although microseismic measurements have provided some insight into the complex fracture network growth (King 2010), microseimics can only capture a small portion of rock deformation and cannot provide any information about proppant and conductivity distribution (Cipolla and Wallace, 2014). Diagnostic tools such as production logs, fiber optics, tracers etc. are often qualitative and severely limited by non-uniqueness of the interpretation. In addition, the accuracy of current fracture models to simulate the network fracture growth is limited to only 2D (McClure 2014) and pseudo-3D models (Weng et al., 2011; Meyer et al. 2013). All these factors have made completion engineers to choose the optimization parameters based on ad-hoc, trial-and-error approaches.|","natural fracture, conductivity, hydraulic fracture, shale gas, proppant"

Hydraulic fracturing is often the most effective option to stimulate production in unconventional reservoirs to economic levels. Results of stimulation can be mixed unless the hydraulic fracture design correctly interprets the geological and geomechanical setting of the field. In fields with naturally fractured reservoirs, the interpretation is particularly critical because natural fractures strongly influence the final stimulated rock volume. An accurate description of the natural fracture network and the geomechanical properties and stresses of the rock provide the information to optimize stimulation treatment in naturally fractured unconventional reservoirs. However, the uncertainty in some of this information can jeopardize the value of the modeling and the success of the stimulation. One of the key geomechanical parameters, which are often poorly constrained, is the maximum horizontal stress magnitude. Microseismic data are able to map the stimulated rock volume during hydraulic fracturing operations. These data can be used to verify the accuracy of the fracturing treatment modeling. 
Here, we present a case study characterizing geomechanical parameters of an unconventional reservoir using a novel technique that includes calibrated mechanical earth models. The technique reduces uncertainty in the geological and geomechanical parameters used to design hydraulic fracture operations, improving the prediction of the final stimulated rock volume.   
Introduction 
Due to the extremely low permeabilities in most unconventional reservoirs, horizontal wells and multistage hydraulic fracturing stimulations have become the necessary completions in such reservoirs. Natural fractures exist in most unconventional reservoirs and these natural fractures interact with hydraulic fractures. Therefore, instead of creating biwing planar fractures while fracturing unconventional reservoirs, complex fracture networks are often created. The creation of complex fracture networks effectively increases the stimulated reservoir volume and productivity.|","Unconventional, Fracture modeling, Microseismic, Geomechanics, Maximum horizontal stress"

The Monteith Formation is an important tight gas reservoir in the Deep Basin, Alberta, and consists of a progradational succession of shallow marine sediments, non-marine carbonaceous and coaly, coastal plain facies, and coarse-grained fluvial deposits, from base to top, respectively. This study compares rock properties and production performance of the uppermost lithostratigraphic unit (Monteith A) and the lowermost portion (Monteith C) of the Monteith Formation in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) in Alberta. 
The study is based on multi-scale description and characterization techniques using cores and drill cuttings, including multiple laboratory measurements of key reservoir parameters such as porosity and permeability. A second stage of the study involves the use of laboratory measurements obtained from cores and drill cuttings and their integration with well logs to produce a numerical 3D model of the study area. The 3D model is used to history match gas production, and forecast performance of new wells in those areas where the geologic model indicates potential for gas production. The ultimate goal is to provide a better understanding of the distribution of reservoir properties in the study area, for developing drilling prospects and their production potential. In addition to that, the reservoir modeling stage is carried out by implementing a recently developed methodology that integrates a Variable Shape Distribution (VSD) model, capable of capturing different reservoir properties through the whole scale spectrum without any data truncation. This new methodology introduces an extension of the VSD approach for reservoir simulation purposes. 
The results are showing that the Monteith A unit has better rock quality than the shallow marine sandstones of the Monteith C interval. This is most likey due to larger pore throat apertures ranging between 0.5 and 1 microns, relatively higher proportion of preserved intergranular pore space within these coarser-grained framework grains. Furthermore, the best production performance is found from wells that are actually producing from the uppermost interval. The resulting 3D reservoir model will allow to improve field development strategies for this and other similar unconventional gas reservoir in the Deep Basin of Alberta.|","Monteith Formation, Reservoir Characterization, Deep Basin, Variable Shape Distribution, Western Canada Sedimentary Basin"

Although organic-rich shale formations are being extensively produced in many places in the United States, the unexpected early production decline is still not fully understood. This phenomenon could have many physical or operational reasons. One of the physical attributes is the time-dependent characteristics of the shale mineral assemblage when interacting with the fracturing fluid. Creep deformation is one of those time-dependent characteristics through which rocks exhibit continuous deformation under constant load that affects reservoir completion and hydraulic fracture stimulation. In this study, shale creep deformation was characterized and rheological models were developed. Triaxial creep experiments were conducted on rock samples from the Eagle Ford shale from southern Texas. Samples were tested with water, decane, or without any circulating fluid to assess fluid-shale interaction. Eagle Ford shale mineral compositions were also investigated using X-Ray Diffraction analyses in an attempt to correlate minerals fluid sensitivity. Problems such as loss of fracture width and length due to shale viscoelastic behavior while embedding the proppant can be better understood if the magnitude of shale creep is well characterized. The experimentally calibrated viscoelastic model not only addressed the instantaneous, transient, and long term sample deformations, but also enabled the estimation of proppant embedment depth during production. The creep deformation was most pronounced when the shale was impregnated with water. Decane-impregnated samples produced less creep deformation and the least creep was measured on the dry ones. The theory of linear viscoelasticity was used to model the samples time-dependent deformation when subjected to their respective constant loads.|","Viscoelasticity, Fracture Closure, Proppant Embedment, Fluid-Shale Interaction, Shale Creep"

Multistage hydraulic fracture stimulation of horizontal wells often results in asymmetric hydraulic fractures, which are suboptimal for draining reservoirs. Field observations suggest that hydraulic fractures grow further than expected toward, and sometimes up to and beyond, adjacent producing wells. Such interference from nearby wells is of increasing importance in densely drilled unconventional reservoirs, where hydraulic fracturing is common. Eventually, the underlying mechanism needs to be factored into well spacing plans and hydraulic fracture treatment designs, which can either mitigate the undesired consequences of the nonvirgin conditions, or take advantage of them. 
An integrated approach has been developed to quantify depletion-induced stresses. In this approach, a three-dimensional (3D) Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) is constructed using the finite-element method to initialize the in-situ stresses. Coupled simulation between the dynamic reservoir model and the geomechanical model is used to quantify stress variation, induced by pressure depletion of the parent well. The altered stress profile is then used as input to a hydraulic fracture design. 
The methodology has been applied to an unconventional resource play in the Williston Basin in North America. In this example, three adjacent horizontal wells were hydraulically fractured and put on production sequentially within four years. The analysis indicated that the minimum horizontal stress decreased in the area between a newly drilled well and the nearby producing well; whereas the area on the opposite side of the new well showed no obvious stress variations. Formations above and below the depletion zone experienced an increase of minimum horizontal stress as a balance effect of the finite-element calculation. Fracture modeling using the depletion-induced stresses showed that the effective half-length of the fracture directed toward the depleted well can extend up to two times the length of the hydaulic fracture in the opposite direction. 
Introduction 
In the last decade, there has been an increased emphasis on improving multistage hydraulic fracture stimulations of horizontal wells in unconventional resources. The stimulation technique has revolutionized the exploitation and production of unconventional reservoirs worldwide. Multiple horizontal wells are often drilled and completed in one pad unit because of the operational, environmental, and economic advantages. To achieve the best production and recovery, operators want to know the optimal spacing of wells and the ideal timing of infill drilling and completions. The hydraulic fracture geometry influences the drainage area and the resulting hydrocarbon recovery, which will in turn affect the decisions regarding well spacing, timing of infill drilling, and completion design. 
In-situ stresses are the predominant factors influencing hydraulic fracture propagation and containment. Normally, the first horizontal well in a drilling unit, which is also called the parent well, experiences original reservoir pressure and virgin in-situ stresses. Hydraulic fractures in this parent well are usually balanced symmetrical wings unless there are local structure complexities (Zeng et al. 2003). After a production period, wells drilled and completed nearby a parent well are usually called infill wells. As drilling density increases, infill wells are drilled and completed where fluid pressures and/or rock stresses have already changed due to production in nearby wells. Observations suggest that hydraulic fractures grow further than expected toward, and sometime up to and beyond, adjacent producing wells (Warpinski et al. 1982; Mukherjee and Poe 1995; Dohmen et al. 2013). Such interference from nearby wells is of increasing importance in densely drilled unconventional reservoirs where hydraulic fracturing is common. It was recently demonstrated that hydraulic fracture asymmetry will affect well productivity as well as overall hydrocarbon recovery of the area (Mata et al. 2014).|","unconventional resources, depletion, fracture asymmetry, induced stress"

In the area of this study, the Quintuco-Vaca Muerta complex is an ultra-low permeability, highly over pressured, laminated calcareous and shaly rock that extends over 5000 km2 with an average gross thickness of 700 m. It overlies some 30 meters of what is known as the kitchen of Vaca Muerta, a world-class, high TOC source rock, the main source rock for the Neuquen basin in Argentina. Whenever found naturally fractured, it can produce high quality oil at attractive initial choked rates as high as 1500 bopd. 
Historically, throughout many drilling campaigns, it has been very difficult to anticipate where it will have enough good reservoir properties such as to grant a commercial completion. Many times in the past decades, as soon as the wells showed important kicks during the drilling phase in Quintuco-Vaca Muerta, the wells were completed without any further evidences other than high initial productivity indexes. This led more often than not, to wrong decisions and the completions turned out to be sub-economical. 
Drilling operations through this geological sequence present severe well control related problems such as difficulties anticipating pore pressures, predicting fluid influx levels and mainly the fact that an increase in mud weight in most of the wells, instead of leading to well control, exacerbates formation fluid kicks and influx pressure. 
Combining geological knowledge, production history, downhole pressure while drilling (PWD), surface underbalanced drilling (UBD), mud logging data and drilling experience, a specific underbalanced drilling methodology was developed assuming one main hypothesis which is that in some areas of the field, the formation is naturally fractured and it is potentially critically stressed. This drilling methodology defines how the optimum mud weight is identified, how to deal with formation fluid influx and the well killing procedure; additionally a dynamic soft well shut-in method was defined. 
An integrated effort of drilling and reservoir engineering allowed the operator to design and execute a meaningful short reservoir limit test that facilitated the evaluation in real time of the size of the accumulation and the reaching of an informed decision on whether or not to complete the well from this interval. 
Introduction 
Time and again, throughout the exploration and development history of this area of the Neuquen basin, many wells showed such important kicks and evidences of a potential oil accumulation that usually operators tended to run drill stem tests or in the case the kick was so severe that drilling ahead could not continue, the well was completed openhole. 
If the well could be killed with the appropriate denser mud, casing, cementing and perforating was attempted as well, many times with disappointing results because the chances of hitting the natural fractures with the charges were slim. In other occasions, the natural fractures were completely obliterated with cement and sustained such a severe damage that production could not be regained even after acid jobs. 
This paper describes a completely new approach to the same old problem. An operational methodology was devised to give management an informed decision whether or not a naturally fractured reservoir should be completed and how to manage and control a highly over pressured reservoir.|","Reservoir limit test, Underbalance drilling, Shale, Vaca Muerta"

Understanding water uptake of gas shales is critical for designing fracturing and treatment fluids. Previous imbibition experiments on unconfined gas shales have led to several key observations. The water uptake of dry shales is higher than their oil uptake. Furthermore, water imbibition results in sample expansion and microfracture induction. This study provides additional experimental data to understand the effects of rock fabric, complex pore network, and clay swelling on imbibition behavior. 
We systematically measure the imbibition rates of fresh water, brine and oil into the confined and unconfined rock samples and crushed packs from different shale members of the Horn River Basin. We also measure the ion diffusion rate from shale into water during imbibition experiments. The results show that confining the shale samples decreases the water imbibition rate of samples tested parallel to the bedding. However, it has a negligible effect on water uptake of samples tested perpendicular to the bedding and on ion diffusion rates. The comparative study suggests that, for both confined and unconfined samples, water uptake is higher than oil uptake. The liquid imbibition and ion diffusion rates along the bedding are higher than those against the bedding. Surprisingly, the crushed samples show a completely different behavior. The oil uptake of crushed packs is higher than their water uptake. The data suggest that the connected pore network of the intact samples is water wet while the majority of rock including poorly connected pores is oil wet. This argument is backed by complete spreading of oil on fresh break surfaces of the rock. 
1. Introduction 
Tight oil and gas reservoirs, considered ""unconventional resources"", have been emerged as a significant source of energy supply in the United State and Canada, to supplement the decreasing supply of conventional resources and meet the increased global demands on oil and gas (Frantz et al, 2005; Zahid et al., 2007; Khlaifat et al., 2011). Unconventional resources with ultralow matrix permeability are capable of producing oil and gas at economic rates when completed by hydraulically fractured horizontal wells (Ning et al., 1993). During hydraulic fracturing, a great amount of water-based hydraulic fracturing fluid with low proppant concentration is injected into the target formation to create multiple fractures and increase the contact surface between the wellbore and reservoir (Holditch and Tschirhart, 2005; Palisch et al., 2010). However, only a small fraction of injected fluid, typically 10 to 20%, can be recovered during the clean-up phase (King, 2012; Cheng, 2012). Spontaneous imbibition of fracturing fluid is known as the primary mechanism for fracturing fluid loss and ineffcient water recovery (Cheng, 2012; Bennion et al., 2005; Paktinat et al., 2006; Shaoul et al., 2011; Roychaudhuri et al., 2011). Other possible mechanisms which control the behavior of the retained water in the reservoir include gravity segregation and stress-sensitive fracture conductivities (Holditch, 1979; Gdanski et al., 2009; Parmar et al, 2012; 2013; 2014).|","Shale Gas Wettability, Water Imbibition, Water Leak-off"

High-volume (>200MBBLS/well), slickwater hydraulic fracturing operations on vertical Williams Fork wells in the Piceance Basin, CO have resulted in >2X increases in initial production rates and estimated ultimate gas recoveries.  Here we present a model for the role of increased water-injection volumes in increasing well productivity.  Predominantly vertical, east-west striking natural fractures, as indicated by interpreted image logs, are optimally oriented for shear failure with respect to the east-west maximum horizontal stress direction.  Borehole breakout modeling of the same image log dataset suggests a large maximum horizontal stress, further critically stressing existing vertical natural fractures.  Hydraulic fracturing and leakoff were modeled using commercial modeling platforms to constrain both the 2D hydraulic fracture dimensions as well as changes in reservoir pressure during and after injection.  Post and syn-injection reservoir pressure distributions, natural fracture distributions, and stresses were then put into an in-house geomechanical modeling program to determine the magnitude and distribution of shear failures along natural fractures associated with changes in net effective stresses.  All models worked in tandem to history match injection rates, injection pressures and microseismic event distributions.  Modeling results show that an elevated reservoir pressure due to high injection rates and water volumes during hydraulic fracturing result in the stimulation of more natural fracture orientations over a greater area, thereby increasing the size and permeability of the stimulated reservoir volume.  The lack of necessity for proppant in Williams Fork completions suggests that most of the fractures are failing in shear and are self propping, which allow for benefit from reactivated natural fractures that are not hydraulically connected back to the wellbore via propped tensile fractures. Therefore, injection-enhanced stimulations are likely associated with large stress anisotropies and abundant natural fractures that are chiefly oriented subparallel to the maximum horizontal stress azimuth.  The ability of the rocks to self prop will dictate the magnitude and duration of permeability enhancement. So although only self propping rocks will see long term benefit from the shear failure of natural fractures, this model may still have utility when assessing the early-time productivity of more ductile and compliant reservoirs, which will see a degradation in productivity as the reservoir is drawn down and fractures begin to close.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Piceance Basin, Tight Gas Sands, Williams Fork, Microseismic"

Today, shale reservoirs are completed with multiple hydraulic fractures. For efficiency reasons, hydraulic fracturing is typically staged, each stage comprising of multiple perforation clusters with the aim of initiating one hydraulic fracture per cluster. Cluster spacing is an important parameter to optimize, but the following is still unanswered: What is the minimum spacing that can be achieved between hydraulic fractures, given that both formation heterogeneity and stress shadow play a governing role?   This paper uses a new model for the simultaneous initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures from a horizontal well. Based on this model and observed field results from a well completed with 92 single-entry fracture treatments, new insights on the lack of robustness associated with multiple cluster plug-and-perf completion are presented. Without a large perforation friction pressure drop, there is a minimum spacing of clusters below which, fractures are shut down by the stress shadow effect. The stress shadow can, however, be mitigated with a large perforation pressure drop when there is no stress variation between clusters. Moreover, significant stress variations along clusters can be overcome by engineering the limited entry technique (choking down clusters in low stress zones), provided that the corresponding stress variations are known. 
The limited entry technique however fails to enable hydraulic fracture initiation and development from all of the perforation clusters if there is a significant variation of near-wellbore pressure drop associated with the complexity of the fracture geometry in the near-wellbore when re-orienting toward the far-field in-situ stress direction. 
Downhole pressure measurements from an experimental well completed with 92 single-entry fractures show large variations in near-wellbore pressure drop, highly correlated with the variations in breakdown pressures even though the stress variation estimated from the mineralogy are very small along the lateral. Had this well been completed with stages of 4 clusters each, a significant portion of the clusters would not have initiated and most of the slurry would have been taken by less than half of the clusters.  Using the single-entry fracturing technique, each of the perforation clusters has initiated and propagated fractures as designed.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Stress Shadow, Single Entry, Shale Stimulation"

The results from an ongoing laboratory study investigating petrophysical and geomechanical characteristics of the Montney and Bakken formations in Canada are presented. The primary objectives are to 1) fully characterize the pore network (porosity, pore size distribution) and fluid transport (permeability) properties of these formations in areas with limited datasets; 2) investigate the interrelationship between petrophysical and geomechanical characteristics of these fine-grained tight reservoirs; and 3) analyze the effects of different geological factors on porosity, pore size distribution and permeability. The techniques used for characterization include: Rock-Eval pyrolysis (Tmax, TOC); bitumen reflectance; petrography (grain size); helium pycnometry; low-pressure gas (N2) adsorption (surface area, pore size distribution); pressure-decay profile permeability, pulse-decay and crushed-rock gas (N2, He) permeability; fracture permeability and mechanical hardness tests. 
Rock-Eval analysis and microscopic observations indicate that most samples are organic-lean (average TOC content: 0.3%), ranging from fine-grained siltstone to very fine-grained sandstone (grain size: 31.8-53.7 <U+03BC>m). The measured pulse-decay and crushed-rock permeability values increase significantly with increasing porosity (2.1-14.1%), ranging between 1.1·10-6 and 7.3·10-2 mD. For the plugs analyzed (as-received), profile (probe) permeability values (9.1·10-4 - 6.7·10-3 mD) are consistently higher than pulse-decay (1.6·10-5 - 9·10-4 mD) and crushed-rock (1.1·10-6 - 5.4·10-5 mD) permeability values. Corrected profile (probe) permeability values for in-situ effective stress (5.3·10-5 - 1·10-3 mD) are, however, comparable with the pulse-decay (1.6·10-5 - 9·10-4 mD) permeability values. Unpropped fracture permeability, determined using an innovative procedure in this work, can be significantly (up to eight orders of magnitude) higher than matrix permeability under similar effective stress conditions. The grain size and mechanical hardness data are correlated to permeability. The dominant pore throat diameter controlling fluid flow is estimated for all samples using Winland-style correlations; these values agree with those obtained from low-pressure N2 adsorption analysis. 
Applying multiple innovative analysis techniques on a large number of samples (26 m of slabbed core, 22 core plugs and their accompanying cuttings), this study provides a roadmap to fully characterize the fluid storage and transport properties of fine-grained tight oil and liquid-rich gas reservoirs. We demonstrate that pore structure, large- and fine-scale (cm-size) permeability heterogeneity, and mechanical characteristics of tight oil and liquid-rich gas reservoirs can be suitably-characterized using the methods we have used with application to flow-unit identification and mechanical stratigraphy determination.

The path from a concept as articulated and developed by an individual research engineer, Roger Butler, to a commercial recovery technology for exploiting Albertas oil sands has at times been a rocky one. More than 30 years of applied research and development at both the laboratory scale and the field scale by a community of researchers has been necessary to advance the technology to its current state of development. The SAGD technology has faced countless challenges since its origin. The public literature is replete with examples of challenges it has faced in the past, and others that are predicted to be just over the horizon. For example, more research and development will be required to expand SAGD to more challenging areas of the Athabasca region. The challenges will include reservoirs that have shale barriers, those that have bottom/top water zones, and those that are marginally too thin for conventional SAGD. Variants of SAGD, such as fast-SAGD, X-SAGD, and ES-SAGD, were conceived in response to the need to expand SAGD beyond the sweet spots in Albertas oil sands where the original technology was demonstrated. Lessons learned from the application of SAGD technology in Albertas oil sands may be useful to international producers from around the world that are interested in trying to adopt SAGD for use in their reservoirs. This paper will discuss potential challenges that may be encountered in the implementation of SAGD as the technology is migrated from its birthplace in the Athabasca oil sands to heavy oil and bitumen reservoirs around the world.|","Heavy oil, SAGD, Bitumen, EOR, steam"

Like cap-rock, aquifer integrity under the ifnluence of thermal extraction is expected todeteriorate due to Underground Thermal Effects (UTE), caused by geo mechamical modification of the stress path at the reservoir level. Most popular thermal recovery methods using UTE are Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) and Steam Flooding (SF).

This issue paper addresses the role of UTE on aquifer integrity under the influence of thermal extraction as identified for cap-rock integrity in the bitumen and heavy oil industry. Main UTE are heave, fracturing, lessen of well integrity and heat plume development. Such UTE develop or enhance underground process that ultimately impact aquitards and aquifer ingegrity. Such proceeses are gas migration, cross formational flow, interwell communication and element mobilization.

The model needs as input data, the reservoir characteristicsn and a mechanical earth model derived from well logs that includes the stress state regime. It also requires the well direction, azimuth and completion information in order to evaluate the well characteristics. In this model an onset sand production condition is calculated looking for the borehole pressure that makes the maximum effective tangential compressive stress equal or higher than the rock strength (failure criteria), which is usually known as critical borehole pressure (CBHP). The results are presented on two kinds of graphs: the CBHP versus depth graph that allows determining the sand production free interval and the CBHP versus reservoir pressure graph that helps to design different well production plans for optimizing the recovered volume avoiding sand production. Results must be calibrated and verified with data field to simulate the real reservoir behavior. Briefly, for a specific well path it is possible to propose the operating CBHP as a function of the reservoir depletion and well completion (open or cased hole), also for a new well, it is possible to design the best well direction and the completion type, in addition to the operating CBHP to minimize sand production.|","sand production, stress, rock strength, analytical model"

The sands associated with heavy oil formations are generally characterized by low levels of cohesion and density, which is viewed in an increased sensitivity of the rock to permanent deformation and hysteresis; hence it is not suitable to model these formations as if their rheological behavior is elastic. This set the need to construct a model, which describes the permanent plastic deformation that rocks from this kind of reservoir have. 
The modeling of the stress-strain behavior of plastic porous media aims to evaluate the permanent deformation that the rock suffers and to study the impact of this phenomenon on the behavior of the reservoir permeability porosity and mechanical stability of the layers overlying (compaction, subsidence).

Waterflood is the most commonly field development scheme used for hydrocarbon recovery in carbonate reservoirs. Successfully managing water injection scheme greatly depends on the reservoir characterization, in both structure and fluids distribution, that in turn requires a variety of subsurface measurements coupled with the ability to integrate them into a coherent subsurface models.
Electrical resistivity is an important tool in formation evaluation of oil and gas reservoirs, and frequently used in logging programs to evaluate near-well reservoir rocks, fluids saturations and to help design well completions. With the extended use and added complexity of reservoir modelling it has become imperative to extend this knowledge away from the wellbores and into the reservoir, thereby enhancing the understanding of fluids distribution inside the reservoirs, thus improving overall field management. This can be accomplished by applying tools that are sensitive to the interwell environment. One of these tools is inductive DeepLook Electromagnetics or Crosswell Electromagnetics (EM). Crosswell EM is an induction based tomography technology, which inductively measures the interwell resistivity between wells. This technology, particularly useful for tracking water and steam floods or mapping residual saturation, is also used to optimize sweep efficiency, identify bypassed pay, and predict fluid-related issues such as water breakthrough.
Integration of Crosswell EM interpreted results to reservoir characterization process may offer new wide range applications to deep reading measurements. The current Crosswell EM interpretations are the results of inverted resistivity and hence the water saturation in pseudo 3-D format between wells. Until now there are no methods, workflows or tools available to integrate Crosswell EM data into the reservoir characterization process through history matching.
This paper presents the methodology and investigation of integration of complex Crosswell EM results to history matching process in order to improve the reservoir characterization during dynamic modelling. The use of this data in reservoir characterization has not been yet considered by the industry. Our attempt is to lead the oil industry to utilize Crosswell EM data in the history matching process of the legacy data. The proposed workflow helps reduce and/or quantify uncertainties in the reservoir model. Therefore, the inclusion of time lapse Crosswell EM data into history matching will improve the understanding of the flow paths, barriers, as well as lateral and vertical transmissibility.|","Document Type

Classical Pythagorean means (harmonic, geometric and arithmetic) of relaxation time distributions and critical relaxation times at arbitrary cumulative saturations cutoffs (from 5 to 85% in increments of 5%) were associated with NMR porosity and correlated with absolute gas permeability. Additionally, to mitigate the low sensitivity of NMR relaxation time to pore size that is typically present in carbonates, mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) curves were used to size scale the respective relaxation time distributions.|Although the relaxation geometric mean is widely employed by the industry, this study suggests that in some cases, it may not be the best selection for NMR permeability estimations. Among the relaxation time averages, the arithmetic mean performed better before and after the MICP size scaling. The best estimations were achieved for relaxation time selections in cumulative saturation cutoffs and performance increased when size-scaled distributions were used. These results have a direct impact on core-log permeability workflows and reinforce the importance of NMR-MICP integration.|","Document Type

Proper characterization of the reservoirs dynamic properties is important for maximizing the ultimate oil recovery, produced by peripheral waterflood. Geological characterization of the Arab limestone is mature, with many hundreds of cores described within a depositional model. Detailed petrographic studies describe the ubiquitous presence of both macropores and micropores. Fifty years of wettability studies indicate an overall neutral to slightly water-wet state. |The ""Rosetta Stone"" project added an extensive Arab limestone pore system database and classification of prevalent multimodal pore systems. The multimodal pore systems are nested, embedded, and connected. The pore systems can be treated as mixtures of instances from four basic maximum pore-throat populations (porositons). The most common class is the bimodal macroporosityType 1 microporosity (M_1) system. The multimodal pore system properties have a profound impact on the reservoir dynamics affecting ultimate waterflood oil recovery. These are the subject of active laboratory displacement studies and field recovery monitoring. |The petrophysical technology for the simultaneous presence of macroporosity and microporosity is mature when the microporosity is associated with clay. For carbonates, the technology is immature. The impetus for an Arab limestone pore system solution based on well logs is multifold. The Rosetta Stone data indicate four distinct maximum pore-throat modes. Arab limestone nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) well logs exhibit multimodal pore-body distributions similar to the four pore throat modes. Core samples exhibiting bimodal pore-throat distributions also display bimodal NMR pore-body distributions. The micro-porositons are stable fieldwide and present in every vertical section, hence, despite potential well-to-well global signal variations, consistent pore system analyses result by using the stable recurring signals as downhole calibrators. These are extracted using depth-selective pore body spectral stacks. The low-resolution time-decay data from wireline NMR supports analysis using only a few Gaussian lineshapes. Finally, the complete pore system range is not covered by a single porosimetry device, so the technology must include a facility for spectral porosity signal splicing and merging. A strong driver for the carbonate wireline technology is the accelerated accumulation of large volumes of pore system data compared to the costly and time-consuming core and core-plug analysis process.|","Document Type

A reliable rock classification in carbonate reservoirs should take into account petrophysical, compositional, and elastic properties of the formation. However depth-by-depth assessment of these properties is challenging, as the result of complex pore geometry and significant heterogeneity caused by diagenesis. Common rock classification methods in carbonate formations are typically based on core measurements and require an extensive core database, whereas core data are usually not available at all desired depths. Furthermore, elastic properties, which control fracture propagation and the conductivity of fracture under closure stress, are often not taken into account in conventional rock classification techniques. In this paper, we apply an integrated rock classification technique based on both depositional and diagenesis effects to significantly enhance (a) assessment of petrophysical properties, (b) selection of candidates for fracture treatment, and (c) production in carbonate reservoirs.
We jointly apply conductive and elastic effective medium theories to estimate depth-by-depth volumetric concentration of interparticle (e.g., interconnected pore space) and intraparticle (e.g., vugs) pores, as well as elastic bulk and shear moduli, in the formation. This process takes into account the impact of shape and volumetric concentrations of rock components on electrical conductivity and elastic properties.
We document a successful application of the introduced technique in the Upper Leonardian carbonate interval of the Veterans field, in West Texas. The identified rock types were verified using thin-sections, core samples, and high-resolution borehole image logs, where available. We estimated elastic moduli as well as interparticle porosity with average relative errors of approximately 8% and 14% compared to the core measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the well-log-based estimates of permeability and water saturation were improved by approximately 50% and 20%, respectively.|","Document Type

Rock Physics analysis is a key stage in seismic based reservoir characterization studies, which attempt to determine the most plausible 3D distribution of the reservoir and the fluids they contain. Rock physics uses the results of a petrophysical evaluation as input, together with the results of laboratory measurements, where available, and combines these using both theoretical and empirical relations to understand how the seismic signal responds to changes in the reservoir properties. The input petrophysical properties are often used as if they were implicit and not derived properties and are rarely questioned or reviewed. In reality, these properties are estimated empirically or semi-empirically and, therefore, carry intrinsic uncertainty. A common misunderstanding, among Geophysicists, is that the small scale changes in mineral and fluid fractions have little or no impact at seismic scale. As a result they often accept a petrophysical evaluation that is over-simplified for use in seismic applications. Furthermore, when a mismatch is found between the observed data and the Rock Physics predictions, the usual conclusion is that this is due to uncertainties in the theories or the seismic data rather than a problem with the input petrophysical evaluation.|","Document Type

The new high-definition oil-based mud (OBM) imager is a pad-based microelectrical imager operating at high frequency to establish capacitive contact with the formation in wellbores filled with nonconductive mud. From multiple modes of operation, formation resistivity-like images are generated using an efficient composite data-processing scheme that approximates formation resistivity either by filtering or applying a correction to minimize the contribution of the OBM to the measured signal. Data from the different modes are ?blended? based on estimated formation parameters to generate an optimized image. This approach requires some knowledge of mud electrical properties.
In addition to the composite processing scheme, we also developed a model-based parametric inversion for quantitative interpretation. The Gauss-Newton algorithm matches the measurements to an accurate computationally efficient approximate forward model built by multidimensional fitting of the data generated using a finite-element simulation. The workflow overcomes the underdetermined inversion problem and calibration limitations of the measurements. The inversion allows flexible model definition and parameterization, including refinement of the calibration, and can process intervals of logging data and measurements from multiple buttons simultaneously. The workflow stabilizes the inversion and improves the consistency of the processed results. To overcome the underdetermined nature of the problem and speed up the inversion, we use a sequence of inversion runs to first iteratively estimate the mud properties for a small depth section of the log; this estimate is then used to invert for the button standoff and the formation resistivity and permittivity for longer data sections.|","Document Type

The papers presents the scratch test, a novel technique born in the late 90s at the University of Minnesota that provides a direct measure of the rock strength (uniaxial compressive strength). It is a simple, non-destructive, fast and robust test that bears the unique advantage of producing a log of strength with a high spatial resolution (centimetric) along the core sample.
The high resolution nature of the test provides a unique insight on the scales and distribution of heterogeneities along the core samples, thereby offering new perspectives for routine and special core analysis.
In the paper we first show (i) how the mismatch between the resolution scale of plug and well log measurements added to the discrete nature of plugging can lead to large errors in the establishment of correlation between petrophysical properties, and (ii) how early knowledge of small heterogeneity length scales can help avoid these errors and thereby reduce the uncertainty in the integration of core and wireline data for the characterization of reservoir rock units.
We then illustrate with some examples how rock strength profiles averaged to the relevant length scale can be correlated with other petro-physical properties measured both on core plugs or inferred from well logs.
Finally, we discuss how standard and special core analysis could benefit most from all the features of the scratch test when introduced at a very early stage of the workflows.|","Document Type

A methane hydrate deposit offshore Japan to be developed needed confirmation of its producibility. This required creating an advanced monitoring system that could be deployed in observation wells. These wells would allow tracking of the thermal disassociation front as the methane was produced. In those wells, the heat released by cement curing could cause unwanted gas hydrate dissociation, which could affect the integrity of the well and surrounding formations. Before putting any wells on production, it was important to validate the advanced monitoring system and confirm the integrity of the observation wells.
Three test wells  one production and two monitoring  were drilled, and the monitoring wells were completed with a unique sandface system combining array-type resistance temperature detector (RTD) sensors and optical distributed temperature sensing (DTS). The DTS system required an optical system to be marinized for the seabed and was configured with acoustic telemetry. The temperature measurement started immediately after the wells were drilled. This allowed temperature changes to be monitored during cement pumping and curing so that the heat effect on the gas hydrate formation could be detected. The RTD sensors recorded the exact temperature at each measurement point during cementing through direct connection to an acquisition system on the surface and were disconnected afterward. Temperature changes were monitored with DTS sensors connected to a subsea acquisition system and controller. The DTS measurements were continued until the flow test, with the acquisition parameters adjustable by the acoustic telemetry.
The RTD and DTS sensors were designed to be accurate to 0.1 0C, with the RTD sensors with resolution on the order of 0.001 0C. This accuracy and resolution were validated via real-time data. The temperature in the well began rising as soon as the cement was injected behind the casing. This increase was relatively high in several zones where large washouts had occurred because of the amount of cement-released heat. The temperature dropped rapidly 2 days after the cementing operation and finally stabilized after several months, demonstrating that the effect of the monitoring wells on gas hydrate formation was minimal. The high-resolution RTD sensors were reactivated before the production test and continued to agree closely with the DTS data.
A quality control data check confirmed that the sandface monitoring systems were operating reliably and the dissociation of the gas hydrate was minimal. The system will enable the operator to validate not just the possibility of real-time sandface monitoring, but also the method and economics of producing gas from the methane hydrate reservoirs. This new method of thermal monitoring may prove useful for targeting previously untapped deepwater resources where doing so was previously impossible.|","Document Type

In the last decade, since its introduction, the successful use of deep directional electromagnetic measurements for well placement has been based on the application of a real-time automatic multilayer inversion. The basic assumption behind the inversion-based interpretation is that a 1D layered medium can be used to fit the data locally. However, the technology is increasingly used to place the wells in more complex scenarios, where that assumption does not hold. Faulted formations are a common type of scenario encountered in most horizontal drilling projects, whether the wells are geosteered or not. Since a fault is generally seen as a discontinuity in a layered formation, it does not fit the 1D assumption and cannot be accurately imaged with a 1D inversion. When long-spacing deep reading tools are used, the presence of faults badly distorts the 1D inversion results within several tens of feet around the fault event.
This paper proposes a semi-automatic imaging workflow for faulted scenarios based on a series of inversions and processing steps taking advantage of the available directional measurement sensitivities to extract specific features such as the formation layering, resistivities, the remote boundaries, and the position and dip of the crossed fault plane itself. No user inputs are required at the start: the model complexity is increased from 1D to 2D as the workflow progresses, addressing challenges in integration of data of different scales. The inversions provide quality control to ensure that the intermediate results are geologically likely.
The workflow was tested on a large number of synthetic cases at different scales and of increasing complexities to ensure stability. Field data examples include single and multiple fault interpretation where deep measurements were used to evaluate change in formation dip due to drag near the fault. Model consistency, positive match, and good reconstruction of directional data are all indicators of interpretation quality, and that the resulting fault model constitutes an adequate representation of the reservoir geometry at hand. This proves that more information can be obtained from deep directional electromagnetic datasets when specific workflows are designed from knowledge of the measurement physics to address specific complex scenarios with non-1D layered geometries.|","Document Type

Core or cuttings samples are often analyzed for chemical and mineral composition to provide ground truth for developing petrophysical or geological applications or for validating log interpretations of elemental concentrations, mineralogy, and matrix properties. Unfortunately, some core data are inaccurate, but they are rarely subjected to quality control measures and can therefore lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the validity of the log data.
For core data, elemental concentrations are generally measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) or inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques. The best way to validate results from these techniques is to test certified reference materials that are composed of sedimentary minerals similar in composition to samples of interest. Core mineralogy is most commonly analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Laboratory results can be evaluated by analyzing known mixtures of certified minerals.
Once it has been established that sources of accurate core elemental concentrations and mineralogy are available, it is advisable to implement routine quality control monitoring. An example of a quality control measure is a technique that requires independent analyses for elemental and mineral concentrations. The technique assumes that the minerals have fixed elemental compositions. Measured mineralogy is used to compute elemental concentrations of the major elements, including Si, Al, K, Fe, S, Ca, Mg, and Na. Derived elemental concentrations are compared with the measured elemental concentrations. Deviations between the derived and measured concentrations are used to evaluate the quality of the input data. Examples of both good and poor inputs for elemental and mineral data are shown. Once the quality of the data is proved to be good, it is possible to use the data to validate the accuracy of interpretations developed for elemental spectroscopy logs, such as the closure model to convert concentrations to yields and models to interpret mineralogy.|","Document Type

After almost 30 years, dielectric logging is going through a recent revival. This is mostly due to the improved logging tools that minimize the effect of the environment. Dielectric measurements offer an alternative method for water fraction estimation in the flushed zone fairly independent of salinity. This independent water volume can be used to determine the remaining oil saturation free of the use of resistivity logs or doped-mud NMR techniques. However, important obstacles that restrict the use of this technology are still found in the field, particularly in highly fractured carbonate reservoirs. Rock heterogeneity with massive drilling fluid losses exist in this difficult environment. Some considerations in running the dielectric tool are: 1) signal attenuation in highly resistive muds, 2) rock texture and 3) calculation of an accurate matrix permittivity.
This paper presents four case studies in which dielectric logs, in combination with other logging measurements, were used to determine ROS in a highly fractured Cretaceous carbonate reservoir in the Gulf of Mexico. The Cretaceous reservoir in this area has a wide range of petrophysical properties. The results from two different dielectric tools, one with single frequency and the other with multiple frequencies, are shown as part of our analysis to determine the impact of dielectric dispersion caused by texture effects. In addition the use of mineralogy-type logs to improve dielectric calculations is discussed as a means to get better measurements in the calculation of accurate matrix permittivity. Finally the results of using dielectric tools in both oil and water based mud are presented to find solutions that can expand the use of this technology.
The purpose of this paper is to provide best practices that can be implemented during the pre and post data acquisition of dielectric logs to facilitate petrophysical interpretations.|","Document Type

Material nonlinearity; boundary and arching constraints; non-uniform reservoir flows; sliding along material interfaces or faults are among the causes of shear deformation or changes in the total stresses, and the resulting stress redistribution in hydrocarbon reservoirs. Previous studies have demonstrated that shear or non-uniform deformation and stress re-distribution in subsurface formations may have significant effects on reservoir fluid flows. Thus, a two-way coupled analysis is the required approach under circumstances where the shear deformation or changes in total stresses in the reservoir cannot be neglected. 
A novel coupled multiphysics simulator is developed for the dynamic modeling of multiphase thermal-compositional flow, and elastoplastic geomechanical deformation. The equations that govern multiphase flow in permeable media, heat transport, and elastoplastic geomechanics altogether lead to a highly nonlinear system. Finite-volume and Galerkin finite-element methods are respectively used for the numerical solution of thermal-compositional multiphase fluid-flow and geomechanics equations on general hexahedral (cornerpoint) grids. Due its improved stability and rapid convergence characteristics, the resulting multiphysics system of equations is solved via a fully-implicit formulation using an effective implementation of the Newton-Raphson method in the default mode. 
The coupled simulator is by-design maximally modular: The flow simulation and elastoplastic geomechanics modules can be run independently in the single-physics mode. Alternatively, these two fundamental modules can be operated in a two-way coupled mode with explicit, iterative, and fully-implicit coupling options. The coupled modeling system lends itself naturally not only to near-wellbore coupled flow and geomechanical deformation problems where poroplasticity may play a more prominent role but also to reservoir-scale simulations where both poroelasticity and poroplasticity are of relevance. The coupled simulator is validated against analytical solutions for simple cases, and using published data in the open literature. Validation results demonstrate the robust, fast, and accurate predictive capabilities of the multiphysics modeling protocol.|","Document Type

Numerical simulation is becoming an indispensable tool for the Oil & Gas industry. In order to simulate large numerical models, common practice is to rely on parallel computing. Here, we present key concepts for the development of numerical application intended to be parallel from start. Design and implementation of numerical simulators require many decisions. However, engineers do not consider parallelization priority. This is not a good decision and we present three factors that affect the implementation and performance of a numerical tool. Memory usage: workstations have very large amounts of memory. It is tempting to ""splurge"" on that resource. However, parallel machines have less memory per processor (e.g. BlueGene and GPU). Reducing the memory footprint in order to parallelize an existing numerical tool is time-consuming and error prone. Conversely, developing numerical code in such environment means that they can run with fine-grained parallelism when needed, but still run in fatter nodes. I/O: Usually the numerical core is the focus of parallelization. Nonetheless, as applications scale to large processor counts, I/O becomes a bottleneck. As an efficient alternative, I/O routines can be implemented in HDF5. This has two main advantages: (1) it is parallel and relies on the underlying parallel I/O system (e.g. GPFS); (2) and it is an open standard. Adopting it at a later stage would mean a different file format in the workflow that would require converters that can become a bottleneck. Solvers: Discretization of the governing equations leads to large systems that need to be assembled and solved several times during the computation. This requires efficient iterative solvers. Interchangeable interfaces for standardized libraries add flexibility. This is fundamental for ill-conditioned problems found in coupled fluid flow and stress phenomenon.|",""

Consistent adherence to safety regulations is a recurring issue in deepwater well construction. The two federal entities responsible for offshore U.S. safety regulation are the Department of the Interiors Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG). The regulatory authority of these two bodies spans well planning, drilling, completions, emergency evacuation, environmental response, etc. The wide range of rules these agencies are responsible for cannot be comprehensively verified with the current infrequency of on-site inspections. Offshore regulation and operational safety could be greatly improved through continuous remote real-time data monitoring. 
Many government agencies have adopted monitoring regimes dependent on real-time data for improved oversight (e.g. NASA Mission Control, USGS Earthquake Early Warning System, USCG Vessel Traffic Services, etc.). Appropriately, real-time data monitoring was either re-developed or introduced in the wake of catastrophic events within those sectors (e.g. Challenger, tsunamis, Exxon Valdez, etc.). Over recent decades, oil and gas operators have developed Real-Time Operations Centers (RTOCs) for continuous, pro-active operations oversight and remote interaction with on-site personnel. Commonly seen as collaborative hubs, RTOCs provide a central conduit for shared knowledge, experience, and improved decision-making, thus optimizing performance, reducing operational risk, and improving safety. In particular, RTOCs have been useful in identifying and mitigating potential well construction incidents that could have resulted in significant non-productive time and trouble cost. 
In this paper, a comprehensive set of recommendations is made to BSEE and USCG to expand and improve their regulatory oversight activities through remote real-time data monitoring and application of emerging real-time technologies that aid in data acquisition and performance optimization for improved safety. Data sets and tools necessary for regulators to effectively monitor and regulate deepwater operations (Gulf of Mexico, Arctic, etc.) on a continuous basis are identified. Data from actual GOM field cases are used to support the recommendations. In addition, the case is made for the regulator to build a collaborative foundation with deepwater operators, academia and other stakeholders, through the employment of state-of-the-art knowledge management tools and techniques.  This will allow the regulator to do more with less, in order to address the fast pace of activity expansion and technology adoption in deepwater well construction, while maximizing corporate knowledge and retention. Knowledge management provides a connection that can foster a truly collaborative relationship between regulators, industry, and non-governmental organizations with a common goal of safety assurance and without confusing lines of authority or responsibility.  This solves several key issues for regulators with respect to having access to experience and technical know-how, by leveraging industry experts who would not normally have been inaccessible.

Due to the narrow mud weight window in offshore wells, a proper wellbore stability analysis is required for a cost-effective execution. Wellbore strengthening is an approach used to increase the fracture pressure of the rock, widen the mud window and consequently enhance the well integrity and mitigate mud losses. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of wellbore strengthening in permeable formations using oil-based mud (OBM) containing in-house prepared nanoparticles (NPs) combined with graphite. A significant increase in the fracture pressure was achieved and the predominant wellbore strengthening mechanism was identified. 
Fracture pressure increase was quantified by carrying out hydraulic fracturing tests on 5 3/4x9 Roubidoux sandstone cores. A 9/16 wellbore was drilled, cased and cemented to simulate well conditions. Overburden and confining pressure were applied on the cores while testing to simulate a normal-faulting regime. Two injection cycles were applied allowing 10 minutes of fracture healing between the cycles. The fracture pressure was increased by 65% when calcium-based NPs (NP2) blends were used, whereas it increased by 39% in the presence of iron-based NPs (NP1). Optimum NPs concentrations were established after a comprehensive experimental screening. A strong relationship between wellbore strengthening and mud filtration at high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) using a filter press on ceramic discs was found. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses were conducted on the hydraulically fractured cores. The fractures were seen to be completely sealed from tip to wellbore. Therefore, tip isolation by the development of an immobile mass was identified as the predominant wellbore strengthening mechanism. A 40 micron-seal containing homogeneously dispersed NPs and graphite was observed. In addition, a 300 micron-filter cake was developed around the wellbore also containing homogeneously dispersed NPs.|","wellbore strengthening, tip isolation, nanoparticles, fracture gradient, hydraulic fracturing"

It is common practice to perform frequent dynamic formation integrity/leakoff tests (FIT/LOT) to measure the fracture pressure. Several authors addressed the uncertainty in the measured value of the fracture pressure caused by mud compressibility and thixotropy. Moreover, field evidence indicates considerable variations in the effective fracture pressures resulting from varying wellbore temperatures. 
This paper presents a mathematical model, validated with field data, to estimate the effective fracture pressure (EFP) from the leakoff test data. The model accounts for the effect of mud compressibility and thixotropy, and considers the effect of transient wellbore temperatures on the geomechanical rock stresses. The study also presents application of quantitative risk assessment (QRA) to represent the probability density distribution of EFP associated with the uncertainties in the input paramaters. The method was demonstrated with two examples from the Gulf of Mexico. The study shows that the operational parameterpumps off time, and two formation properties-Youngs modulus of elasticity (E) and thermal expansion coefficient (<U+03B1>T) contribute most to the uncertainty in EFP. Moreover, a log-normal distribution of the EFP indicated a strong effect of temperature variation. It is also concluded that the uncertainty resulting from the temperature effect could be minimized by conducting the test after a characteristic 60-minutes pumps-off period.|","Thermal, Fracture, MPD, Deepwater, Geomechanics"

Previous field operations of CwD have shown a decrease in drilling non-productive time as well as improvement in controlling lost circulation and wellbore stability. Although advantages of this technology are well noted in the literature, the mechanisms of improvements were not studied comprehensively. In order to study these mechanisms, one has to understand the formation properties, fluid hydraulics, casing dynamics, and how CwD helps in better hydraulic control and results in strengthening effects. In the previous research works, the factors that were widely discussed and results obtained were related to formation properties. However, while considering the stresses in the wellbore, mechanical factors such as the RPM and contact of casing at different positions in wellbore were usually neglected. In furtherance to this study, the importance of plastering mechanism cannot be ignored. This work includes a new insight towards the underlying mechanism of casing-wellbore contact and changes in the near wellbore stresses while casing rotation. The main objective of this study is to investigate the hypothesis of the increase in hoop stress when the casing contacts wellbore with regard to the formation stresses orientations. To accomplish this objective, finite-element analysis has been conducted to simulate several CwD scenarios. The classical equations used to obtain the wellbore stresses include parameters like the far-field stresses, pore pressure, and wellbore geometry. These equations do not consider the effect of casing pipe contact and eccentricity; therefore finite element simulations can be very helpful to investigate these effects. Casing-wellbore contact in both maximum and minimum in-situ stress directions are considered in this study as well as changing contact length. The study of different cases shows the variation of hoop stress, which can be beneficial if properly implemented in CwD operations.|","Casing Contact, Casing while Drilling, Smear Effect, Hoop Stress"

The effects of mud cake build up and filtration with time aids the understanding of formation damage and wellbore stability. The increase of drilling in high temperature and pressure zones (HTHP) necessitates studies that can predict filtrate invasion, and particle bridging. The most common hydraulically challenged zones are: depleted sands or intervals with very low pore pressure and fracture pressure, wellbore ballooning zones encountered in deep water drilling where surge and swab pressures could be a serious challenge, and complete lost circulation/no return zones. 
Filtrate invasion and mud cake build up can be considered as primary factors controlling wellbore stability while drilling. Decreasing the near wellbore permeability by forming an ultra low mud cake can strengthen the wellbore and mitigate further lost circulation problems. Very few studies have investigated filtration and filter cake build up under HPHT situations where effect of different mud particles and bridging solids can be analyzed. 
This paper focuses on experimental methods quantifying water based muds used by the industry and investigating effects on particle bridging, filtrate invasion and permeability. Then adding lost circulation material (LCM) to optimize the particle size distribution of bridging solids as needed. To show the particle bridging effect, high temperature and pressure (HTHP) filtration tests were conducted at different time steps on sandstone cores of 50 mD and 750 mD.

This paper presents a method for the enhanced 1D prediction of the MWW for subsalt wells in the Viosca Knoll area in deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM). An initial stress solution is obtained using a 3D finite-element method (FEM). The stress solution is then used as input data to the 1D prediction tool. The field-scale model used in the calculation is a cubic block with a true vertical depth (TVD) of about 9000 m, a width of 7500 m, and a length of 7500 m. Along the wellbore trajectory, the salt body is 6000 m thick and 5500 m wide. Based on seismic sectional data, an anticlinal structure is constructed accordingly at its bottom surface. The 3D porous elastoplastic FEM calculation was performed first with the field-scale model. The effective stress ratio was provided for the 1D prediction of MWW along the given wellbore trajectory. The finite-element model simulates the geometry of the salt body in detail. Comparisons are made between the results obtained with the enhanced 1D method, the conventional 1D method, and a finite-element method. Solutions obtained with the conventional 1D method missed the abnormality of stress distribution at the salt base and have smaller MWW values, as compared to the other solutions. The solution for MWW obtained with the enhanced 1D method is near the value obtained with the finite-element method, but at only 10% of the time cost. The FEM enhanced 1D method proposed has proven to be the most cost efficient method for predicting MWW for subsalt wells.

For offshore drilling simulation, the facility can apply low-frequency heave vibration as experienced by offshore drilling units, and higher-frequency vibration arising from drillstring motions, downhole tools or bit-rock interaction. 
The laboratory apparatus has a short, very stiff drillstring due to space constraints; however, the simulation system is able to re-create vibration arising from a much more compliant significantly longer drillstring, potentially thousands of meters in length.  Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) system is designed as follows to make the laboratory drillstring behave like the lower portion of a deep-well BHA.  A load cell records dynamic bit-rock interaction force, and uses it as the input to a high-fidelity nonlinear computer model of a full drillstring.  The computer model predicts resulting bit motion, and the laboratory drill rig actuators apply that motion to the physical bit.  If a deep well drillstring would be exhibiting bit bounce or stick-slip under certain conditions, then the bit in the laboratory will have the same motion.  The effect of vibration mitigating measures such as changing WOB or RPM can then be investigated. 
Prior to implementation into the physical apparatus, the HIL, drillstring computer model and control algorithms were tested and refined through control simulation, as outlined in this paper.  For these simulations, the physical rig is represented by a computer model, the virtual rig.  The virtual rig bit force is recorded and used to drive the deep-well drillstring simulation, which returns a predicted bit position at each time step.  A controller generates a command signal to the virtual rig hydraulic actuators to drive the bit to the desired position.  The results show that the short, stiff laboratory drillstring behaves like a deep well drillstring through use of HIL. 
The usage of the physical drilling simulator is expected to answer industry and academia questions on drilling vibration issues, mitigation measures for which would be impractical, if not impossible, to test through full-scale field trials. The authors feel that the drilling laboratory system and controller, for which the proof-of-concept is validated in this paper, is unique in its capability to integrate dynamic models of BHA, drill pipe, Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) subsystems, and ocean environmental conditions in an HIL environment.|","Drilling Simulator, vibration, engineering drill rig, hardware-in-the-loop, offshore drilling"

This paper describes the application of a directional-drilling model to the phenomenon of wellbore spiraling and compares its predictions with field data. The spiraling tendency of a bottomhole assembly(BHA) is determined from a stability analysis of the delay differential equations (DDEs) that govern the propagation of a borehole. These propagation equations are derived from a novel mathematical model, constructed by combining a bit/rock-interaction law, which relates the force and moment acting on the bit to its penetrations per revolution through the rock; kinematic relationships, which link the bit motion to the local borehole geometry; and a model for the BHA, which expresses the force and moment at the bit as a function of the external loads and the deflection imposed by the stabilizers. Spatial delays, associated with the positions of the stabilizers, account for the feedback of the borehole geometry as the stabilizers interact with the wellbore. The analytical form of the propagation equations makes it possible to perform a stability analysis and determine whether borehole spiraling is expected. The coefficients of the propagation equations embody the characteristics of a particular drilling system; these include the BHA configuration, bit properties, and the active weight Wa, a reduced downhole weight on bit (WOB) that depends on the actual downhole WOB, the state of wear of the bit, and the rock strength. If the bit trajectory is unstable, then any perturbation in the borehole geometry is amplified gradually, eventually leading to the generation of a spiraled hole. The stability of the bit trajectory essentially is controlled by the magnitude of a dimensionless group, a function of the lateral steering resistance of the bit, the active weight, and properties of the BHA, relative to a critical value that depends only on the BHA configuration. Predictions of the stability analysis are compared with field data from spiral holes pertaining to eight sections from four wells drilled with different bit types and BHA configurations. The paper shows that the propensity of a BHA to spiral can be estimated by the model by assuming reasonable values for parameters such as the lateral-steering resistance and the part of the WOB transmitted by the cutter wear flats. This ability means that the model can be used to optimize BHA designs and determine critical WOB levels, both of which will mitigate the creation of spiraled holes.|","directional drilling, spiral hole"

The analysis of self-sourcing liquid-rich mudstones is complicated by the inherent heterogeneity of these ultralow-permeability formations. Determining reservoir and completion quality requires a detailed understanding of how rock properties, fluid saturations, hydrocarbon composition, and fluid thermodynamic properties are distributed throughout the reservoir. In many cases, the rock and fluid properties are intrinsically coupled from both geological and physical chemical perspectives and must be analyzed together. A wireline logbased heterogeneous rock analysis (HRA), coupled with advanced laboratory analyses, was used to characterize the distribution of petrophysical properties along a core spanning the entire section of the Neuquen basin Vaca Muerta shale. A novel quantitative extraction and gas chromatography method was used to measure the total hydrocarbon composition (C1C30+) at multiple depths throughout the reservoir. The results of this combined rock-fluid study show that the formation contains two distinct reservoir zones connected by a transitional zone. Each of these reservoir sections owes their uniqueness to a change in depositional and diagenetic processes. This leads to local heterogeneity in properties such as mineralogy, transformation ratio, and hydrocarbon composition, which could not be explained by thermal maturity alone. A high degree of correlation was found between the rock and fluids in each of the reservoir zones. Advanced core analysis studies of the Vaca Muerta shale found that the lower zone contains high quantities of liquid hydrocarbons (~45g/kg of rock), but it has the lowest gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) and the highest viscosity and also contains numerous ash beds that may reduce the overall completion quality of the section. The upper zone lacks the overall liquid hydrocarbon volume of the lower (~10g/kg of rock), but it has a higher GOR, lower viscosity, and fewer ash bedsproperties that are favorable to production. The transitional zone maintains the high liquid hydrocarbon content of the lower zone (~30g/kg of rock) while maintaining moderate GORs and viscosities and being free of ash beds. This transitional zone represents the highest analyzed reservoir quality section in the Vaca Muerta shale when both rock and fluid properties are considered together. The HRA method can be used for data propagation to other regions of the Vaca Muerta shale.|",""

There has been a rapid increase in tight oil production from Bakken Formation in recent years due to the combination of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. However, there are high uncertainties in characterization of fracture properties such as fracture spacing, fracture half-length and fracture conductivity. Additionally, there is a high cost of drilling and fracturing treatments. Therefore, quantifying these fracture properties based on field production data in the Bakken Formation and optimization of fracture design for single well and multiple wells through economic analysis is clearly critical. 
In this work, we performed history matching with field production data in the Bakken Formation, where the wells were pumped with three different proppant types such as sand only, sand/ceramic, and ceramic only. Geomechanics effect, i.e., stress-dependent fracture conductivity, is taken into account. Based on the history matching results, fracture half-length and fracture conductivity were quantified with and without the geomechanics effect. For reservoir modeling including multiple fractures, we compared bi-wing fracture and fracture network models. Each cluster in single perforation stage is assumed to generate an effective hydraulic fracture. Subsequently, we performed optimization of fracture design for single horizontal well with purpose of maximizing the objective function of net present value. Furthermore, based on the optimal fracture design for the single well, we performed optimization of multiple horizontal wells placement in a spacing unit of 1280 acres (1 mile <U+00D7> 2 miles) of the Bakken Formation. Finally, the optimal number of wells was determined. This work is valuable for guiding fracture treatments design and multiple wells placement in the Bakken tight oil reservoirs.|",""

According to the 2013 United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, Vaca Muerta could produce 16 billion barrels of liquids and 308 TCF of gas (EIA, 2013). Up to the time of writing, only about 200 wells have been drilled to test Vaca Muerta, over 90% of them vertical. 
Multiple wells drilled by Pluspetrol in different Neuquen basin locations were selected for this paper to explore and test Vaca Muerta productivity. A wide range of data was gathered. Some examples are: a full set of logs, wet samples, petrophysic and geomechanic tests in cores, geochemistry in cut samples and PVT fluid samples. Most of the wells were completed with two fracture stages while some others had only one stage in order to test the most prolific horizons individually. 
During the production testing, a careful and detailed oriented surveillance program was designed to gather high quality data. Between 14 and 20 months of daily rates and pressure information is available. Additionally, several pump in/flow back tests and extended build ups (more than 40 days) were performed on these wells. Some of these wells flow naturally while others had an artificial lift installed providing information on different production conditions. 
This information was combined to make a full reservoir characterization. A full rate transient analysis workflow was carried out in six wells. This includes straight line plots, type-curve analysis, analytical model history matching and probabilistic forecasting. In addition, pressure dependent permeability and average reservoir pressure increase due to fracture injection fluids effects on well performance will be discuss in this paper. Finally, a set of conclusion with the findings are presented. The aim of this paper is to summarize the analysis and findings to characterize Vaca Muerta as an unconventional reservoir.|",""

Changes in mud density, changes in temperature while drilling, induced changes during the completion, fracturing or stimulation treatments, or even during the abandonment activities, the well is exposed to diverse stresses that can damage the isolation achieved with the cementing jobs. The objective of this study was to perform a complete analysis of the critical stresses during the lifecycle of a well in a deepwater development field, and how these stresses impact the zonal isolation, resulting in a technically suitable sollution for effective long-term isolation. In recent years, the approach of stresses and deformations suffered by the cement sheath during the lifecycle of the well has improved with the introduction of new simulation models and the availability of new technologies. The impact of all those stresses is reduced and mechanical failure of the cement sheath is prevented to maintain the zonal isolation. The importance of this fact is critical in Deepwater operations, as workover costs are huge and in most of the cases, can determine the success or the failure of the entire project. This real case exemplifies the engineering process followed to reach long term well integrity in a deepwater field. From basic analysis to the most complex studies and cementing technologies, the study consider realistic data from the field and the interaction with the well. In one of the two case studies, is noticed the need for deployment of a novel self-healing cement system given the constraints of the formation and its interaction during the lifecycle of the well.

This phenomenon and the quality of the resulting productive stimulated rock volume (P-SRV) is primarily a function of the natural fracture network characteristics (e.g. spacing, height, length, number of fracture sets, orientation and frictional properties); in-situ stress state (e.g. stress anisotropy and magnitude); stimulation design parameters (e.g. pumping schedule, the type/volume of fluid(s) and proppant), well architecture (number and spacing of stages, perforation length, well orientation), and the physics of the natural-hydraulic fracture interaction (e.g. cross-over, arrest, reactivation). Geomechanical models can quantify the impact of key parameters that control the extent and complexity of the P-SRV, with implications to stimulation design and well optimization in the field.

A geomechanics based sensitivity analysis is performed that integrates key reservoir-geomechanical parameters to forward model complex fracture network generation, synthetic microseismic (MS) response, and associated conductivity paths as they evolve during stimulation operations.

Our sensitivity analysis shows that geomechanical models that involve complex fracture networks can be calibrated against MS data and helps predict reservoir response to stimulation, and optimize P-SRV. We analyze a field data set (obtained from two hydraulically fractured wells in the Barnett formation, Tarrant County, TX) and establish coupling between geomechanics and MS within the framework of a 3D geological model. This coupling provides a mechanics based approach to (i) verify MS trends and anomalies in the field (ii) optimize P-SRV for reservoir simulations (iii) improve stimulation design on the current well in near realtime and well design/stimulation for future wells.|",""

The Vaca Muerta shale is an emerging shale play within the Neuquen basin in Argentina. Like most unconventional shale plays, the formation exhibits geomechanical, acoustic and permeability anisotropy. Therefore, advanced logging tools as well as advanced techniques for core measurements and analysis are necessary to properly characterize the geomechanical behavior of the formation. The results of an integrated core and logging analysis of the geomechanical and acoustic properties of the Vaca Muerta formation is presented in this paper with the use of well-known techniques for formation characterization. The geomechanical and acoustic measurements of the core samples from a well in the base of the our study area in Vaca Muerta formation have been used to determine the dynamic and static elastic properties of the formation and how to relate the static properties to the dynamic data. In addition, cross-dipole logging data from the same well was utilized to compare the core data with the logs. The results of the core test were used to develop an anisotropic formation model for which the logs could be calibrated with. Thomsen coefficient epsilon was determined being not equal to gamma while relationships between the stiffness coefficients have been relatively consistent. This finding allowed us to develop an anisotropic model based on the vertical transverse isotropy (VTI) using the core data as an input for the model. The model was then utilized with the logging data to determine the anisotropic stiffness tensor as a function of depth. Based on the Thomsen coefficient gamma, the degree of both vertical and horizontal transverse isotropy has been determined. The results of this analysis indicate that the formation almost exclusively exhibits VTI behavior whether examined through the logs, core, drilling or microseismic data in our study area. The magnitude of the core acoustic measurements does not match well the logging measurements, and this is most likely due to preferential core sampling methods that intentionally exclude natural fractured sections in the cores. Microseismic analysis has shown potential fault reactivation near one of the wells in Loma Jarillosa Este block in addition to the conventional seismicity from the hydraulic fracturing operation that requires further attention in the future development well designs in the area. 
The results of the model developed in this study can be applied to better geomechanical characterization of the Vaca Muerta formation that will help designing suitable completion techniques and hydraulic fracturing design in optimizing production and minimizing footprint in the basin. The accuracy of the model will be anticipated to be improved as additional core measurements are completed and more well data from other wells in the area become available.|","Document Type

With the advent of sliding sleeve technology, operational efficiency could be gained; however, the effectiveness of the completion remained unclear. In order to get a large enough dataset to analyze the efficiency of different completion types, a considerable amount of time and money would have to be invested. This paper will present a workflow comparing different completion styles along a select number of wellbores through fracture pressure history matching and looking at the trends associated with the model outputs to get a better handle on an optimized completion design. Creating a representative hydraulic fracture model (HFM) is a very iterative process. The HFM used in this work integrates specialty logs, core data and pore pressures derived from fracture injection tests. Three wells with varying completion types of open-hole (OH) sliding sleeve, OH RapidFrac sleeves, OH Plug and Perf and cemented Plug and Perf were fracture pressure history matched across all stages. After achieving matches on all stages, trends of propped fracture half-lengths, proppant concentration and propped fracture length area (PFLA) could be broken out by completion type. These parameters pointed to an optimal completion type. This optimized design was then put into place on two adjacent wells. This workflow allowed for an in-depth look at completion type without having to drill and complete a large number of wells. A clear winner was evident, especially when examining PFLA within the pay zone and proppant concentration. The HFM outputs also provided insight into height growth out of the pay zone being attributed to higher rates and fewer entry points. A potential for refracs or hesitation fracs could also be seen with the HFM by integrating it with the microseismic data. All of these results went into an optimized design which was then field tested. Using the calibrated model, the resulting fracture geometries showed that the optimized design was achieving the expected results. As operators move forward with pad drilling and down spacing of units, optimized completions will become more and more important. This paper will demonstrate how varying completion types can influence fracture geometry, propped fracture area and overall well performance and demonstrate a workflow to complete this somewhat daunting task.|","Document Type

We have developed and applied a workflow for the initial exploration of source rock potential as unconventional reservoirs utilizing pre-existing limited data sets. The method uses a multi-disciplinary work-scope in several phases allowing for a broad evaluation of the key success factors for a source rock in a selected project area. The methodology is designed to establish an initial baseline of understanding of key production drivers such as charge, maturity, reservoir quality, completion quality, structure, geomechanic properties and fluids. 
The baseline is achieved by integrating core, log and seismic data in an initial 3D depth model that can be utilized for calibrating a petroleum system evaluation leading to the generation of play fairway maps and an initial resource in place estimate. A further phase provides an economic viability assessment and cost expectations for exploitation of the unconventional source rock. The method provides the necessary support for key decisions including planning of pilot well locations, and an associated data acquisition strategy including core collection, logging programs and optimization of future seismic programs. By combining information from the play fairway mapping with representative petroleum engineering estimates it is possible to provide probabilistic estimates of economically recoverable resource volumes in each assessment unit and use this analysis to establish whether there is an opportunity for economically viable production within the study area. 
A strong emphasis is placed on rapidly integrating the available existing data in order to support the decision making process. From a number of examples around the world we have seen data quality and quantity vary tremendously and have adapted the workflow and scope for each project accordingly. The type of data commonly retrieved and utilized includes 2D seismic data, occasionally 3D conventional narrow azimuth seismic surveys, and vintage log suites for petrophysical calibration, occasionally core data, temperature gradients, organic information and literature from basin characterization studies. 
A number of these studies have been conducted or are in progress. However the authors will focus on the results of a study in North Africa to demonstrate the value of the methodology in rapidly and positively impacting the decision making process.|",""

The current fracing industry paradigm is to isolate stimulation intervals. Cased cemented horizontal well stimulations follow a rigidly prescribed format. The casing is perforated, a hydraulic fracture treatment is pumped, and isolation is set above the previously stimulated interval before the casing is perforated for the next interval. These steps are repeated as necessary to stimulate the entire lateral section. Isolation is held as a fundamental requirement of completions under the belief that a lack of isolation between intervals will result in the loss of stimulation fluid through previously perforated intervals. 
This paper illustrates a brief history of field tests which resulted in a paradigm shift towards non-isolated intervals. Events are discussed which led to the discovery that slick water fracs can be executed in the Horn River Basin with no isolation between frac stages (Nexen Energy ULC patent pending plugless fracing process). Multi-stage plugless horizontal completions are examined on a number of horizontal well pads. Experimental results cover 80+ plugless intervals on multiple pad developments over a period ranging from 2008 to 2014. Included is an example of a complete 25 interval horizontal wellbore with no isolation between any frac stages. The benefits of the plugless stimulation method are many fold, including reduced operational risk during pumpdown operations; no plugs to get stuck or set in the wrong place; no plugs to drill out and no plug debris on flowback, eliminating costly and time consuming operations; making longer horizontal sections possible as length is not limited by the capability to drill out plugs; and faster cycle times. 
Well information and surveillance data will be described for the plugless fracs deployed to date. The data illustrates successful application of the technology in Nexens Horn River shale development. Surveillance and production data is considered in order to present possible explanations on the mechanics behind the success of this technique.|",""

Hydraulic fracturing is crucial to geothermal and hydrocarbon recovery. This process creates new fractures and reactivates existing natural fractures forming a highly conductive Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) around the borehole. The fracturing process of anisotropic rocks such as shales is examined through this report. We divide the rock anisotropy into two groups: a) conventional and b) unconventional (shaly) anisotropy. As the first group, we study two extreme rock types: 1) Lyons sandstone, a brittle, low porosity and permeability, weakly anisotropic (11%) material and 2) pyrophyllite, a strongly anisotropic (19%) metamorphic rock similar chemically and mechanically to shale with extremely low porosity and permeability. As the second group, shale samples (18% anisotropy) from Wolfcamp formation are studied. The calcite filled veins are observed to be mostly subparallel to the fabric direction. Brazilian tests are carried out to observe the fracture initiation and propagation under tension. Strain gauges and Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors record the deformation leading to and during failure. SEM imaging and surface profilometry are employed to study the post-failure fracture system and failed surface topology. Fracture permeability is measured as a function of effective stress. The effect of anisotropy on fracturing is also investigated by rotating the fabric direction of the sample disks relative to the loading axis through increments of 15 degrees. 
The rock microstructure, lamination, and brittleness control the activation of the layers. Lyons sandstone shows a wide brittle fracture with larger process zone with twice as much layer activation at lower stress levels. The fracturing process in shale is however a coupled function of rock fabric and calcite veins. The veins easily activate at 15 degrees orientation with respect to the loading axis at 30% of the original failure load. The resulting unpropped fracture has enhanced permeability by orders of magnitude. The findings of this research bring new insights toward an economic and efficient completion design. Fracking through a deviated well reduces the breakdown pressure significantly and activates a large number of veins with enhanced conductivity without the need for proppant injection.|",""

The majority of the play involves multi-stage horizontal wells for tight gas exploitation. This case study focuses on channel sand Glauconitic oil pools. These semi-conventional pools were initially exploited with hydraulically fractured vertical wells. The implementation of multi-stage fractured horizontal wells has breathed new life into the play, with much higher production rates, recoveries and better economics. The historical fracturing technique used in the Glauconitic consisted of a gelled hydrocarbon fluid system, due to known reservoir fluid sensitivities to water. The operator had completed a number of multi-stage horizontal wells using this fracture fluid system, and was uncertain if this was the optimum fracture design or fluid system. Production analysis of the existing multi-stage horizontal wells was used to determine how effective the fractures were, as well as drainage areas and estimated ultimate recoveries, etc. The study concluded the gelled hydrocarbon fracture design was not optimal in terms of effective fracture half lengths, or net present value (NPV). A new fracture design was proposed, involving the use of foamed, solids free, viscoelastic surfactant water based fracture fluids, much larger fracture sizes and higher conductivities. This new design was implemented on approximately seven multi-stage fractured horizontal wells (MFHW) during 2013. The new design approach has increased well productivities and enhanced the economics significantly compared to the old design. Other benefits include: much better capital efficiency, better cleanup, accelerated positive cash flow, reduced safety issues and reduced sand flow-back problems.

This study presents a comparison of hardness data from a slabbed liquids-rich core with complementary well logs and core analysis. Hardness refers to the measure of resistance to permanent deformation from an applied force, and depends on a range of material properties, some of which are independently measured by standard well logs and core work. Leeb rebound hardness was manually measured with the portable Equotip 3 by Proceq. Within the handheld tool, a 3 mm diameter ball indenter is launched by spring against the sample; the ratio of the rebound velocity to impact velocity determines the Leeb hardness value. The Equotip was originally designed for testing metals, although recent studies have employed this tool to improve geomechanical characterization of core samples and field exposures. Hardness measurements, collected at two inch intervals, and high resolution whole-core dual energy computed tomography (CT) data elucidate the fine-scale mineralogical heterogeneity of unconventional reservoir rock. For example, thin laminations of softer calcareous marl cause anomalously low hardness measurements within hard, blocky, limestone or chalk. X-ray CT provides core images, as well as variations in density and effective atomic number (Zeff). In the tested core section, hardness trends with Zeff more closely than with other data sets, such as density, elastic properties, total organic carbon, and shale volume. This suggests that the mineralogy may be a key factor in controlling mechanical stratigraphy. The Equotip is less destructive than scratch or indentation hardness tests, is easy to use, provides instantaneous results, and has the potential to replace costly tests; however, a dependable methodology is necessary to maximize efficiency and minimize error. Reliable hardness data can then be scaled up and integrated with well logs.|",""

The advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies have enabled shale gas production economically. Although there are a huge number of horizontal wells drilled in many shale gas reservoirs, well performance and completion effectiveness are still poorly understood. The different features of shale gas reservoirs from conventional gas reservoirs, such as non-Darcy flow behavior, gas adsorption/desorption, geomechanics (stress-dependent fracture conductivity) are not investigated completely. In addition, there are high uncertainties in shale and fracture properties such as fracture half-length and conductivity. Also, the cost of fracture treatments is high. Hence, it is absolutely important to systematically evaluate these unique features of shale gas reservoirs, quantify the rank of key parameters, and optimize fracture treatment design through economic analysis. 
In this work, based on the typical reservoir and fracture properties of Marcellus Shale, we evaluated the effects of non-Darcy flow behavior, gas desorption, and geomechanics on well performance. Additionally, we compared bi-wing fracture and fracture network models. Subsequently, we used the Design of Experiment (DoE) method to perform sensitivity study to quantify the rank of important parameters in short-term and long-term production periods. Six uncertainty parameters including fracture height, fracture conductivity, fracture half-length, cluster spacing, permeability and porosity were investigated. According to the rank of significant parameters, we performed history matching with one field production well. Based on the history matching results, the range of key fracture parameters such as fracture half-length, height, and conductivity was determined. Additionally, a 30-year production forecasting was performed and its corresponding EUR was quantified. Finally, optimization of fracture design was conducted in combination with economic analysis. This work can provide significant insights into quantifying the uncertainty, characterization of fracture properties, and optimization of fracture design for the current development of the Marcellus Shale.|",""

The microseismic distributions can be used as a proxy to estimate fracture length, azimuth, height, asymmetry, overall complexity, and general stage behavior. However, this technology has a number of limitations for fully understanding the behavior of the hydraulic fracture because it is unclear as to the direct relationship between the microseismic source and the tensile hydraulic fracturing process itself. The integration of other diagnostic technologies with microseismicity is needed to extract more detailed information about the fracturing process, the completion scheme, staging, and other relevant development details. In particular, surface tiltmeters, downhole tiltmeters embedded in microseismic arrays, distributed temperature sensing (DTS), distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), and more conventional diagnostics are used to enhance the understanding of the microseismicity in field applications. A combination of field data, theoretical analyses, and simulations demonstrate how such information can be extremely valuable in optimizing stimulations. The application of these technologies is geared toward unconventional reservoirs where multistage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells is the preferred development approach, although application in vertical wells is also useful.

The pore sizes of shale and tight-rock formations are on the order of nanometers. The thermodynamic phase behavior of in-situ hydrocarbon mixtures in such small pores is significantly different from that of bulk fluids in the PVT cells mainly due to effect of large capillary pressure, which has been a subject of great interest for shale reservoir study. For example, it has been recognized that the critical pressure and temperature of reservoir fluids may change due to the pore spatial confinement, thus the phase envelop shifts for unconventional shale reservoirs. Those shifts of phase envelop could favor the productions of shale reservoirs, especially for tight oil systems because of suppressed bubble-point pressure leading to longer single phase production. 
On the other hand, the pore sizes, especially the pore-throats, are subjected to change due to rock deformation induced by the fluid depletion. As the fluids are being produced from the pore space, the pore pressure will decrease; thus the effective stress on reservoir rock increase, resulting in the reduction of the pore and pore-throat sizes. This reduction on pore spaces affects again the fluid flow through impacts on the thermodynamic phase behaviors, as well as stress induced changes on porosity and permeability. Thus a coupled flow-geomechanics model including pore confining effects is in general necessary to examine the unconventional shale reservoir behavior. 
In this paper, we present a multiphase multi-component reservoir model, fully coupling fluid flow, geomechanics and pore confining effects for shale reservoirs. This model is based on general mass conservation law for each component. The geomechanical model is derived from the elasticity theory extended to porous and non-isothermal media. The Peng-Robinson EOS-based flash calculation is used to analyze the large capillary pressure effects on shale reservoir phase behavior. This theoretical model can be readily discretized and implemented with control volume based numerical methods, and generally applied to both dew-point and bubble-point systems. Eventually it could improve the forecast accuracy for long-term production rate and recovery factors of unconventional reservoirs.|",""

Organic matter may play an important role in the storage and transport of hydrocarbons in shale reservoirs. In some shales a significant amount of porosity is located in the organic matter and how well that organic matter is connected is crucial for the creation of possible flow pathways. The distribution of organic matter also affects the elastic properties and anisotropy of the shales which is important from a completions and seismic mapping standpoint. Because of the heterogeneity of shales and micron to sub- micron size of the organic matter, mapping changes in organic distribution with sufficient resolution to capture all the organic matter has proven difficult. With the advent of large area ion beam milling and automated high-resolution SEM imaging-stitching, the distribution of organic matter can now be mapped on centimeter-sized areas with nanometer resolution. Using these methods we investigate the distribution of organic matter within a sample of the Wolfcamp shale. Results from the SEM mapping suggest that over 50% of the organic matter in the sample consists of sub-100 nm regions. In addition, most of the organic matter is elongated in shape and locally disorganized with organization increasing somewhat with increasing organic matter size.|","Document Type

This paper presents a methodology elaborated by Total EP for ranking shale plays in terms of fracability using a set of geomechanical parameters obtained from different sources including lab measurements, well log data and poromechanical earth model (PoroMEM). A sustained productivity of gas shale is strongly dependent on geomechanical parameters such as in situ stresses, shale elastic and strength properties that control the geometry of hydraulic fractures and the connectivity and hydraulic conductivity of natural fractures networks. In the proposed methodology, the term «fracability» qualifies the shale gas in terms of propensity to develop a stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) in combination with hydraulic fractures that have the desired geometry and sustainable conductivity. The geomechanical indicators characterizing the fracability include: the likelihood of reactivation of natural fracture networks, the horizontal stress contrast on one side and stress contrast in vertical plane on the other side, the ratio of unconfined compressive strength to the maximum in situ stress, the elastic stiffness matrix and its anisotropy, and the Brinell hardness. The fracability is evaluated by plotting the geomechanical indicators on a radar chart graduated between low to high SRV quality limits that are defined on the light of past Totals experience with shale gas.|",""

Cyclical sedimentation patterns are common in unconventional resources shales, whether they be carbonate- or siliciclastic-dominated. In many resource shales the cyclical patterns have been related to eustatic sea level fluctuations, even though these fluctuations may sometimes be obscured by tectonic overprint. The cyclicity is reflected in repetitive sedimentation patterns which represent alternating relatively shallow/oxic- and deeper/anoxic-water deposition. Typical cyclicity might occur in the form of alternating clay/organic-rich and quartz/calcite-rich strata. In more carbonate-rich sequences, organic-rich marls might alternate with organic-poor limestones. This cyclicity can occur at a variety of stratigraphic scales and provides a sequence stratigraphic framework for mapping, correlation, and interpretations. Incised valley fill may provide a localized, thicker, more organic-rich stratigraphic section (sweet spot), than adjacent areas. 
Within the context of geomechanics, these cyclical strata are termed brittle-ductile couplets. Using the Barnett and Woodford shales as examples, clay/organic-rich intervals tend to be relatively ductile (relatively low Youngs Modulus and high Poissons ratio) and cleaner quartz/calcite-rich intervals tend to be relatively brittle (relatively high Youngs Modulus and low Poissons ratio. In carbonate-rich deposits such as the Eagle Ford Formation, re-crystallized, TOC-poor limestones tend to be stronger and more brittle than TOC-rich marls. 
Within the context of microseismic, microseisms may be vertically stratified or layered, with some horizons containing more events than other horizons. This stratification has been related to brittle-ductile couplets in at least one area, and placed within a sequence stratigraphic framework. 
Within the context of geochemistry, ductile strata tend to contain more TOC, and are thus better potential HC source rocks, than brittle strata, which contain less TOC. Biomarkers (geochemical fingerprints) are useful for interpreting sources and environments of deposition of organic matter, and ultimately used for environmental zonation of shales. 
Using these principles and observations, it is possible to build a sequence stratigraphic framework from multiple data sets to map and correlate brittle and ductile strata, organic-/hydrocarbon-rich zones, and more fracturable stratigraphic intervals. A suggested horizontal landing zone is the brittle strata within a brittle-ductile couplet. It is hypothesized that when hydraulically fractured, both brittle and ductile strata become fractured, and hydrocarbons move from the ductile to the brittle zone, whose fractures remain open after proppant emplacement. With time, ductile strata may close around the proppant and become sealed.|",""

Natural fractures provide preferential pathways for fluid migration, and their effect is especially high in rocks with low matrix permeability. These fractures are usually lined or completely filled with mineral cement. The presence of cement can hinder the connectivity between residual fracture pores, thereby reducing fracture permeability. 
In order to better understand fluid transport in the Niobrara Formation, we studied the influence of cementation on flow in the fracture. We acquired the fracture geometry from x-ray microtomography (CT) scans, capturing the small-scale roughness of the mineral-lined fractures. The permeability and tortuosity of the fracture profile were determined from simulations of fluid flow through these geometries with impermeable fracture walls. 
We used a combination of the level-set-method-based progressive-quasistatic algorithm (LSMPQS software), and Lattice Boltzmann simulation to characterize the capillary-dominated displacement properties and the relative permeability of the naturally cemented fractures. Finally, we numerically investigated the effect of increasing cement layer thickness on the fracture permeability as well as the tortuosity of the pore space and the capillary pressure-water saturation (Pc-Sw) relationship. 
Pore space tortuosity and capillary pressure as a function of water saturation both increase with the numerically simulated increase in thickness of the fracture cement layer. Even when there are no cement contact points or bridges in the original fracture volume, numerical fracture cementation creates unevenly distributed apertures and cement contact points. This in turns causes the wetting and non-wetting fluids to impede each other, with no consistent trends in relative permeability with increasing saturation.|","Document Type

Detailed discussions on the poroelastic behavior of stiff shales are provided with the aim of developing a fast reliable method to characterize stress-dependent shale permeability using the constant rate of strain (CRS) consolidation test. Shales usually have dense stiff matrices composed of soft grains. Characterizing the hydro-mechanical properties of shales in fully-saturated condition is challenging due to their very low permeability. For reliable development of unconventional reservoirs in terms of borehole stability and hydraulic fracturing, the effect of hydromechanical interactions between shale matrix and pore fluid is an important factor. Thus, fast, reliable and simple test methods to characterize the hydro-mechanical properties of saturated shales are needed. 
Applying the CRS test standardized for soft soils to shales confronts some critical technical issues. Satisfying the required test condition, that is one-dimensional consolidation with satisfactory one-dimensional fluid flow in test sample, is highly difficult for shales. Thus, the consolidation is carried out in isotropic stress condition. Stress-dependent anisotropy of deformation of tested shale attributed to their layered structure is evaluated based on the stiffness matrix determined in a previous study. In the standard CRS procedure, the permeability during CRS test is related to the strain rate, sample thickness, and excess pore pressure. However, in shales, non-negligible compressibility of solid grains is considered to cause a certain loss of excess pore pressure, which is not considered in the standard procedure. In this study, the loss of excess pore pressure is compensated by assuming that the ratio of excess pore pressure for a porous medium composed of compressible solid grains to that for a porous medium having negligible solid grain compressibility is equivalent to the value of Skempton's pore pressure coefficient, B, of the former medium. To extract the B-value of shale sample from that experimentally-determined in the presence of porous metal filters, the B-value of multi-layered porous media is formulated in relation to the fluid saturation, porosity, Biot coefficient, and solid grain bulk modulus of each layer. The extracted B-value based on the estimated value of fluid saturation of sample, 0.94, overcompensates the loss. It is found that the CRS permeability values obtained by assuming full saturation are highly consistent with the steady-state permeability values.|",""

When a long term water or CO2 injection operation is performed, the overburden formation becomes unstable due to the reservoir expansion. These field operations induce formation strain and pore pressure change in all overburden formations. Predicting the magnitude of formation strain and pore pressure change is important for analysis of borehole stability, casing stability and overburden formation stability. Two methods are developed in this paper. One is an analytical method assuming no mechanical property contrast between overburden and reservoir formations. The other is a set of figures created by a numerical model for predicting formation strains and pore pressure change during compaction and expansion with mechanical property contrast between overburden and reservoir formations. The parameter analyses give the following results: (1) Formation strain becomes significantly large if the Youngs modulus of overburden formation becomes small. The casing design must be conducted including the formation strain of cap rock. (2) If the shear modulus between overburden and reservoir formations is similar, the pore pressure increases at the overburden formations. However, if the difference of the shear modulus is large, the pore pressure decreases in the upper and lower cap rock with reservoir compaction. This new finding may change our common sense of pore pressure change of shale section around a reservoir. This paper provides a set of equations and figures to quickly predict the pore pressure change and formation strain focusing on overburden formation where casing and formation stability problems are induced during production and injection operations. If the quick analysis indicates that the overburden strain and pore pressure change significantly affect the field operations, comprehensive analysis must be conducted with a geomechanical finite element model using a super computer.  |","Pore Pressure Change, Formation Strain, Overburden formation, Compaction"

Unconsolidated formations and depleted reservoirs are the main causes for lost circulation during drilling and cementing operations, often resulting in poor cement bond logs and failed top of cement (TOC) requirements. The common practice to address these well integrity problems is to apply lost-circulation materials and low-density cementing systems designed at 10.5 to 11.0 ppg. This strategy did not always achieve the desired results and remedial cement squeeze jobs were needed for many primary cement jobs.
To overcome these challenges, an innovative cement spacer system was engineered and applied. The environmentally preferred spacer system contains a biopolymer to mitigate lost circulation issues during cementing. It strengthens the wellbore wall by forming an effective seal along the formation, minimizing losses and preventing cement fallback after placement.
The initial field application was immediately successful in obtaining full circulation returns during cementing, a constant challenge on prior jobs. An added advantage was the cement slurry density could be increased from 10.5 to 13.5 ppg without encountering losses, despite exceeding the maximum theoretically allowable equivalent circulating density (ECD). The increased slurry density improved early cement strength development, which reduced wait-on-cement times and reduced the requirement for expensive lightweight cement materials. This simplified operations and logistics, and reduced costs.
Multiple case histories are presented covering more than 60 successful cement jobs using the new spacer system. Specific cases are discussed where successful results were achieved despite partial to total losses during the drilling phase; where cement bond logs have improved; and where remedial jobs have been eliminated. Conservative cost savings with the new spacer design are more than $2.5 million USD.|","Spacer, Well Integrity, Case History, Cementing"

Most reservoir simulation studies only consider the fluid flow characteristics without any attention to the formation-fluid compatibility and interactions. The rock-fluid interaction is known to have a large impact on determination of the geomechanical and acoustic properties of the formation and may result in the misinterpretation of the logging, well testing analysis and microseismic data, resulting in inaccurate evaluation of the formation. In this paper, the grain contact adhesion hysteresis model introduced by Tutuncu (1992) was modified to improve non-Hertzian deformation with the addition of the elastic moduli and permeability anisotropies. The dependence of the geomechanical and acoustic properties as a function of applied stress, fluid saturation and measurement frequency have been investigated in anisotropic rocks. The modified model was utilized to study the effect of the interactions between the fluid and rock and the role of the fluid chemical, electrochemical and dielectric properties on the deformation and acoustic properties of shales and tight gas sandstones. A practical methodology for modeling the anisotropy of the fluid-rock system has been added into the Tutuncu's grain contact adhesion hysteresis model for better representation of geomechanical behavior of the highly anisotropic unconventional reservoir characteristics. The effects of temperature and partial saturation are also incorporated in the model. The model provides a quantitative evaluation of the influence of surface forces on the deformation and the micromechanics of the granular rocks and how they are influenced when they are exposed to various fluids. The results show that while the viscosity and density of the saturating fluid are the key factors in reservoir engineering studies, the rock-fluid interactions play a significant role in deformation, failure and wave propagation behavior in the tight oil and shale gas formations. Porosity, clay content, stress, saturation, frequency and anisotropy have leading roles in controlling deformation, failure, permeability, and wave velocities in shale reservoirs.|",""

The conventional reserves are depleting significantly on a worldwide basis. In order to meet the demand for hydrocarbon energy, it is essential to develop unconventional resources. Over the past decade, shale oil becomes an important source of oil across the North America. Bakken shale oil, one of the largest shale oils in the world, is producing near 1,000,000 barrel oil per day. The main methods exploiting Bakken oil shale are drilling horizontal wells with multi-fracturing technology. Even with the technology evolution of shale oil exploration and well stimulation in shale plays, the recovery factors in Bakken are still very low due to the nature of extremely low permeability. Original oil in place in Bakken ranges between 271 and 503 billion barrels. Primary recovery with multi-stage fracturing in horizontal wells only can produce 5 to 10%. Therefore, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods will play a crucial role to recover the remaining hydrocarbons. With EOR techniques such as gas injection, chemical injection, microbial injection, and thermal recovery, the recovery factor can be increased by 10-30%. In this study, different EOR methods applied in Bakken were reviewed. The mechanisms and causes that lead to the success and failure of different EOR methods were analyzed and discussed. With the lessons and experiences learned from these EOR applications in Bakken, significant cost saving on can be achieved for future Bakken oil development and production. The significances of this study are: (1) proposed screening criteria for different EOR applications in Bakken; (2) identified appropriate EOR technique to improve the recovery of specific reservoir, especially low permeability shale reservoir; (3) provided lessons and experiences accrued in EOR application in Bakken during last several decades to curtail learning curve and optimize EOR design in the future; (4) served as guidance in EOR applications in other shale oil plays.|",""

Vaca Muerta formation is a Jurassic-Cretaceous lithostratigraphic unit in the Neuquen Basin of Argentina, well known as a world-class source rock and for its unconventional resource potential. Vaca Muerta play in the central Neuquen basin position has a remarkably thick continuous organic-rich section (approximately 350m). 
Chevron Argentina is evaluating the Vaca Muerta potential in the El Trapial exploitation lease. Data available includes 500 km2 of 3D seismic data, wire-line and mud log data from 4 exploratory vertical wells with full e-log suite and 415 meter of core, and from 5 legacy wells with basic e-logs. Vaca Muerta outcrops in an analog stratigraphic setting are located 40 km away from El Trapial. 
Initial results of the stratigraphic analysis were based on seismic interpretation, well log evaluations and core data analysis. Correlations and comparisons between the subsurface interpretation and the outcrops of Vaca Muerta allowed us to tie stratigraphic sequences in El Trapial to the regional framework. 
This study builds upon previous regional sequence stratigraphic interpretations and provides a refined stratigraphic framework for distal facies of the Vaca Muerta. Similar to other shales worldwide, Vaca Muerta deposition was initiated with a marine transgression over non-marine deposits of the Tordillo Formation. This transgression is expressed as a condensed section with high gamma-ray and TOC values in the basal section. Accommodation changes and paleo-depositional trends were interpreted based on strata cyclicity, thickness variations, and seismic stacking patterns. An internal Vaca Muerta stratigraphic subdivision was defined based on seismic data, logs, thin sections, facies and organic geochemistry analysis. 
Recognition of lateral and vertical heterogeneity within Vaca Muerta will lead to better planning and exploitation of hydrocarbons through enhanced reservoir models and improved target identification, which will ultimately reduce risks and costs. Stratigraphy plays a key role in the identification of the most productive stratigraphic interval (i.e., Sweet Spot), and most prospective region (i.e., Core Area), to develop an unconventional project.|",""

This paper describes the use of the Material Point Method (MPM) for modeling the propagation and interaction of multiple hydraulic fractures (HF) with natural fractures (NF) in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford. First the method is used on a laboratory experiment involving one HF and one NF to illustrate the effect of stress anisotropy on the curving of fracture propagation. For an anisotropy equal to 1 and a NF perpendicular to the HF, the HF propagates at an angle from the maximum horizontal stress direction. The MPM simulations show that curved propagation is unlikely for higher stress anisotropy. This result can help explain the curving of microseismic events observed in many frac stages. A recently developed geomechanical workflow is applied to an anomalous Marcellus well where a seismically derived fault attribute map was used to derive a continuous Equivalent Fracture Model (EFM). The MPM geomechanical simulation of multiple hydraulic fractures propagating in the input EFM model leads to the estimation of a strain field that correlates well with microseismicity and a J integral at each frac stage which appears to be correlated to the production log in the studied well. The new workflow is used to evaluate quantitatively the benefits of an engineered completion as compared to the regularly spaced completion. It was found that the J Integral and its correlation with the production log is a reasonable measure of the impact caused by skipping a frac stage. The new workflow is applied to an Eagle Ford well that shows three regions of microseismic character supported by tracer tests. Using the coherency as structural input, nine hydraulic frac stages were added to the Equivalent Fracture Model (EFM) to simulate the strain map, which shows the same features as the interpreted microseismic. The workflow is extended to a larger area to include a well that does not have microseismic data. The large scale curvature was used as input in the geomechanical workflow over the large area and was able to reproduce the main features seen on the well that has microseismic events but most importantly was also able to predict in the well with no microseismic its main performance characteristics through the use of a strain map that acts as a good proxy for the predicted microseismicity. The field validated geomechanical workflow based on the use of MPM and a continuous natural fracture description provides the E&P industry a powerful frac design and optimization tool that will allow fast prediction of microseismicity in any shale well that has an accurate structural attribute preferably derived from 3D surface seismic.|",""

In China, tight gas has increased to 50% of the proved natural gas reserves.

Successful hydraulic fracture treatments require sound frac designs based on reservoir geomechanics and geology. This paper demonstrates a workflow that integrates Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) simulation with Tomographic Fracture Imaging (TFI), a passive seismic monitoring method (Geiser et al., 2012; Lacazette et al., 2013). DFN models are built at the level of detail of individual fractures using information resolved using the TFI approach. These DFN models are then used to understand reservoir production and geomechanics. 
This paper shows examples of DFN simulations that predict frac propagation and reactivation of natural fractures by hydro-shearing and hydro-jacking. By tracking fracture propagation and reactivation, the simulator produced hydraulic fracture fields that can be compared to and calibrated with observed TFIs. This process provides confidence in both the Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) and Tributary Drainage Volume (TDV) determined for the fracture treatment. The distinction between SRV and TDV is important, because induced hydraulic fractures and natural fracture reactivation can produce seismic activity in a larger volume than actually contributes production. Also, natural fractures can contribute production from regions outside the SRV if hydraulic fractures effectively connect the well to the natural fracture network. The calibrated simulations of TDVs provide a basis for improved frac designs, well-test analyses and production forecasts.|",""

Economic production from shale gas cannot be achieved by natural mechanisms alone; it requires technologies such as hydraulic fracturing in multiple stages along a horizontal wellbore. Developing numerical models for hydraulic fracturing is essential since a successful fracturing job in a shale formation cannot be generalized to another due to different shale characteristics, and restricted access to the field data acquisition. Empirical methods and Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM)-based numerical techniques are still the prevailing design tools in most of the hydraulic fracture applications though they provide a reasonable prediction only for hard (brittle) rocks. The plastic zone and softening effects at the fracture tip have been neglected in modeling hydraulic fracturing, which results in the prediction of conservative fracture geometry and imprecise fracture pressure. These effects can be identified by the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) but not by LEFM. Moreover, CZM is able to model fracturing interfaces; for instance, natural fractures, which are mechanically weaker than the adjoining materials. Brittle shales are more likely to contain more natural fractures while ductile shales act as good seals for the fractured layers. In this work, we modeled single and double-stage fracturing in a quasibrittle shale layer using an improved CZM for porous media besides including the material softening effect and a novel boundary condition treatment, using infinite elements surrounding the solution domain of interest. We illustrated some superior aspects of CZM compared to LEFM in shales. We demonstrated the significance of Youngs modulus, Poissons ratio, pumping rate, viscosity, and leak-off in the pumping pressure, and fracture aperture. Also, we found that the stress shadow effects on induced fractures significantly influenced the characteristics of subsequent induced fractures. Moreover, we investigated various scenarios in number and sequence of fracturing stages. Our fully coupled analysis provided us with a continuum-based leak-off model eliminating the requirement for an explicit leak-off model such as Carters leak-off model.|",""

Horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing are the key technologies enabling the oil and gas industry to unlock unconventional resources. Based on microseismic data, hydraulic fracturing in shale reservoirs typically creates highly complex fracture networks due to their complex geology and the activation of the pre-existing natural fractures that cannot be realistically captured when the classical planar bi-wing fracture models are implemented. Coupling geomechanical modeling with microseismic data interpretation helps a better understanding of the fracture complexity that is anticipated for enhanced production performance. Recently, new stimulation design patterns have been proposed for production optimization using this approach by coupling the fundamental geomechanical concepts in order to waive the stress interference constraint of the minimum fracture spacing and to produce further fracture complexity in the altered stress regions. 
The goal of this study was to evaluate and compare two new stimulation patterns, namely, the alternate fracturing and the zipper fracturing, to the consecutive multi-stage stimulation pattern from fluid flow perspective using a numerical dual-permeability model. The study considers anticipated fracture complexity and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) overlap of parallel lateral wells. An economic evaluation was also conducted to couple the flowbased optimization with the net present value (NPV) analysis to quantify costs vs. benefits of selecting a specific stimulation pattern. 
Results of this research demonstrate how the configuration of fracture stages, complexity of fracture network and SRV overlap impact the production performance and eventually NPV of the studied stimulation patterns. The comparison study highlights the governing parameters and provides insights on the significance of developing and optimizing a stimulation pattern utilizing fluid flow evaluation. A hybrid alternate-zipper pattern was also suggested in this paper to take advantage of both patterns by combining the anticipated fracture complexity and SRV overlapping features.|",""

Horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing are the two critical enabling technologies to facilitate a rapid development of shale gas reservoirs. The process of hydraulic fracturing often creates complex fracture networks, especially in some shale reservoirs with a high brittleness and a large amount of pre-existing natural fractures. In addition, gas desorption might be a significant contributor to the total gas recovery. However, accurate modeling gas flow from the complex fracture networks is very challenging. Therefore, development of an efficient simulation approach to properly model gas flow from shale gas reservoirs with complex fracture geometry by taking into account the gas desorption is important to evaluate well performance and completion optimization. 
In this work, we focus on developing an efficient semi-analytical approach to simulate gas production from shale reservoirs with the complex fracture networks by considering the gas desorption effect. A series of case studies are performed to compare simulation results with a numerical reservoir simulator. Single fracture, multiple fractures, uncertainty fracture pattern with varying fracture spacing and half-length are investigated with and without considering the gas desorption effect. Furthermore, single inclined fracture and multiple inclined fractures with different angels are studied.

Hardness and brittleness are key mechanical properties for rock types that are susceptible to fracturing. Typically, these rock properties are measured by sonic wireline logs or through triaxial tests on rock core. Core-based rock measurements are costly and therefore usually provide limited data sets. Sonic-log-derived properties have limited bed resolution, which is a significant issue in many shale reservoirs where rock properties can vary significantly over small stratigraphic intervals. An alternate method using hand-held devices such as rebound hammers has recently been shown to produce reliable, reproducible rock strength results that correlate to laboratory and logging techniques. The advantage of hand-held equipment is significant cost savings and the ability to take measurements at a single-bed scale (less than 4 cm2 [0.62 in2]), thus more data can be gathered within a particular rock unit. A low-energy rebound hammer was used in this study to characterize rock strength (confined compressive strength [CCS]) in Niobrara and Frontier Formation cores from the Piceance Basin in Colorado. Leeb strength values that were obtained from the rebound hammer were converted to unconfined compressive strength (UCS) values using the method described by Zahm and Enderlin, 2010. UCS values were then converted to CCS using an empirically derived correlation of UCS and CCS from Core Labs North America Shale Consortia data set. The results show a strong correlation between the laboratory-measured triaxial CCS and the micro-rebound hammer CCS measurements when plotted against depth. Furthermore, there is a good correlation between the log-derived Youngs modulus, bulk modulus and Poissons ratio with the micro-rebound hammer data.

The most effective method for stimulating shale gas reservoirs is horizontal wells with successful multi-stage hydraulic fracture treatments. Recent fracture diagnostic technologies such as microseismic technology have shown that complex fracture networks are commonly created in the field. However, often times, the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) obtained from the microseismic interpretation does not provide propped fracture volume and its conductivity such that, commonly, there is a difference between the SRV that is open for the gas flow and SRV obtained from microseismic diagnosis. 
In this paper, the coupled hydraulic fracturing model that is capable to simulate dynamic fracture propagation, reservoir flow simulation, the interactions between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing natural fractures, and proppant transportation will be used to conduct numerical experiments. The effects of proppant size, horizontal differential stress, fracture fluid viscosity, pumping rate, and natural fracture spacing on the propped stimulated reservoir volume (PSRV) and hydraulic fracture conductivities is then compared and quantified. At last, using the knowledge gathered during parametric studies will be applied to enhance the effectiveness of stimulation. 
Simulation results from the parametric studies show that enlarging SRV does not guarantee larger PSRV. Our result shows that thin fluid with viscosity of 1 cp to 2 cp increases SRV but it decrease PSRV because proppants are not distributed further inside of network with thin fluid. Fracture intensity increased in a reservoir with relatively smaller horizontal differential stress and natural fracture spacing. The conductivity of propped fracture network increased when fracture intensity is low and larger proppant size is used. These results will provide a better understanding to enhance SRV, fracture intensity and fracture conductivity through proper proppant, fluid and pumping rate selection depending on the differential stress and the complexity of pre-existing natural fracture network.|",""

Among natural fractures observed in core of Eagle Ford Shale, Texas, tall sub-vertical calcite-cemented fractures are the most spatially extensive. These completely cemented fractures break preferentially along one of the two cement-host rock interfaces during core handling suggesting that these fractures would be preferentially reactivated along the cement-host rock interface during well bore completion. Fracture cement adhering to one of the host rock walls would thus form a fracture skin on one face of the reactivated natural fractures. We used scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) on ion-milled samples of fracture cement and host rock to study pore space connectivity between the matrix and reactivated sub-vertical calcite cemented natural fractures. In the fracture calcite cement, we observed open micro-fractures suggesting that this cement layer is partially permeable to flow. The permeability of these micro-fractures was determined by lattice Boltzmann methods and upscaled using an effective medium method to determine the permeability of the fracture cement.

"289","1922672-MS","Microseismicity and Geomechanics: Modeling and Comparisons","Johnson, Scott, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","|Summary  
Microseismic source interpretation is often used to gauge the spatial extent of hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs. It is usually difficult to interpret this data beyond a gross approximation of the maximum extent of joint activation and fracture propagation, either due to under-resolution of instrumentation, the inversion process, or possibly the interpretation of the moment tensor. Together, these issues lead to a challenging environment for making more complicated operational decisions based on microseismic data. 
The approach taken here is to capture micro-seismicity as an emergent phenomenon from the simulation of flow and geomechanics in a fractured reservoir. This model is then applied to an at-scale stimulation operation, including natural fractures sampled from geostatistical distributions of fracture size, orientation, and constitutive parameters informed by field measurements. The results of this study are compared to field observations and are shown to capture some of the key features of microseismicity, including the spatial distribution of events with time, the frequency-magnitude relationship, and the observed source mechanism tensor distributions. 
Additionally, such simulations offer the advantage of testing hypotheses regarding the origin of different observed phenomena. Here we use the simulations to test whether we can reject the hypothesis that stress perturbations alone (due to the reorientation of the stress tensor in the vicinity of propagating hydraulically driven fractures) can explain the majority of microseismic events. It is shown that such dry microseismicity, i.e., seismicity not connected with the arrival of a fluid front, cannot be rejected, challenging the assumption that microseismicity is indicative of connectivity between the well-bore and locations of events in the reservoir. However, it also suggests that encoded in the micro seismicity may be additional information about the composition and stress state of the reservoir.|",""

Major cyclic events related to sea oscillations provided the proper marine environment conditions to promote the development of several source rocks within the basin apart from Vaca Muerta Formation, such as Los Molles and Agrio formations. 
Regional surface data suggests that vertically (time domain) and laterally (space domain) Vaca Muerta Formation comprises a wide variety of lithologies: shales, marls, carbonates, calcareous sandstones and sandstones. Subsurface data, obtained from mud logging, cores and open hole logs also demonstrate it. Both sources provide sufficient sampling density for interpreting the different facies of the unit from the Lower Tithonian to the Lower Valanginian and also considering its areal extent within the basin. 
These variations are related to the basement fabric, post-rift subsidence interrupted by inverse reactivation, east-west basin asymmetry and climate changes from semiarid seasonally humid to warm and dry. 
A summary of these characteristics are: a) a prograding NW carbonatic ramp best represents depositional environment; b) formation thickness increases to the west and north; c) carbonates are better developed in proximal areas; d) organic matter content increases at the base of the formation; e) paleotopography clearly controls facies distribution; f) to the north of the basin hydrocarbons are related to organic rich argillaceous limestones, to the center of the basin are mostly pelithic sediments while to NE correspond to a mixture of the above mentioned, to the south the euxinic conditions favored hydrocarbons with increased sulfur concentration. 
Consequently these vertical and lateral facies variations control key aspects such as: areal distribution, depth, thickness, porosity, permeability, heterogeneity, TOC, mineral composition, reservoir pressure and geomechanics. 
In this paper a comprehensive analysis using outcrop, well, and laboratory data of the Vaca Muerta Formation are presented summarizing the main hydrocarbon<U+00B4>s accumulations with its unconventional reservoir characteristics.|",""

The recent advances in micro-seismic monitoring suggest that hydraulic fracturing stimulation in unconventional reservoirs (shale-gas) has often caused complex fracture networks. The most important factor that might be responsible for the fracture complexity is the interaction between natural and hydraulic fractures. Optimization of hydraulic fracture treatments considering natural fractures requires accurately modeling the interaction and investigating fluid flow in the networks. 
In this study, we present numerical results that quantify the nature of a hydraulic fracture (HF) propagating interactions with natural fractures (NFs). The numerical model is based on a simplified three dimensional displacement discontinuity method and finite difference method. The Newton-Raphson method and Picard iterative method are used to handle the coupling between rock mechanics and fluid flow. Fracture propagation and fluid invasion into pre-existing fractures are both driven by an incompressible, non-Newtonian fluid in a permeable homogenous reservoir.|","Document Type

The impact of petroleum-expulsion fractures on productivity of the Bakken shales were investigated by integrating epifluorescence petrography, pressure transient analysis and analysis of petroleum-expulsion fracturing. 
In early exploration vertical wells, drilling breaks from ten minutes to one minute per foot with gas increases from ten units to several hundred units were considered poor shows in the source rocks of the Bakken shales. Drill Stem Tests (DST) over the Bakken shales were reported with average production rates that reach several tens of barrels per day. These shales were overpressured with no matrix porosity in evidence and permeability in the micro Darcy scale. Production was assumed to come from fractures. Speculative conclusions were drawn about these fractures to be related to source-rock maturity, petroleum expulsion and overpressuring. These conclusions were a significant promoter for exploration in the Bakken Formation. 
Those speculative conclusions have encouraged to review a total of 64 Drill Stem Tests (DST) over different intervals that include the Bakken Formation and/or the underlying three Forks Formation. Resistivity logs, cores and thin sections were studied to conduct an integrated geological interpretation for pressure transient behaviors of the Bakken shales. The study highlights that the Bakken shales are naturally fractured and can be interpreted on resistivity curves separation. The Three Forks and Middle Bakken pressure transient behaviors imply spherical flow which indicates that there is always contribution from the Bakken Shales. The Bakken pressure transient behavior shows dual porosity flow (naturally fractured) with low fracture systems storativity (<U+03BB>) implying that fluid is mostly stored in the matrix. The study also suggests that the matrix gives up its fluid rapidly to the fracture system indicating high interporosity flow (<U+03C9>) and implying that petroleum-expulsion fractures contribution is present. 
The significance of petroleum-expulsion fractures resides in its ability to provide higher permeability pathways through the Bakken shales, and explains their high deliverability. The volume expansion due to petroleum generation is invoked as a mechanism to increase pressures to levels of inducing expulsion fractures responsible for primary migration of petroleum and forming the Bakken unconventional pervasive petroleum system.|",""

Rock compressibility is one of the most important properties in petroleum exploration and production. It is an essential parameter in drilling and completion design. Knowledge of geomechanical properties of target reservoirs ensures producing hydrocarbons from unconventional resources safely, environmental friendly, and economically. Because the direct measurement of rock compressibility is time consuming and cost expensive. Indirect measurement of rock compressibility from other readily available experimental data, such as permeability and sonic velocity tests, is highly demanded. Rock compressibility from other aspects not only is a good reference for the directly measured rock compressibility, but also is an important supplement in case that no direct measurement is available or experimental data are unreliable due to lab and human errors, irregular core plug, and/or non-uniform deformation. 
In this study we developed a method to determine the rock compressibility using permeability experimental data. The significance of this investigation is that the new approach has a solid theoretical base. With this the core analysis can be reliable and accurate. The combination of the proposed method with direct measurement can be employed to ensure the reliability of the experiment and quantify the uncertainty resulting from lab and human errors.|",""

Short and long term production forecasts are important for assessing the performance and value of unconventional oil and gas wells, setting production targets and predicting cash flows. Often the best way to try to estimate future production of a new completion is by analogy with production from other nearby completions with similar treatment histories. Forecasting production using type curves combines knowledge with experience using physics-based decline equations, type curve coefficients and an engineers judgment. Modern algorithms for predictive analytics can be based on a generative model (GM) which does the same thing. A GM is a stochastic model which can be constructed to capture physics (solutions to differential fluid-flow equations) with experience (probability distributions that are calibrated using historic data). The result is a model which is similar to a type curve in that it can be used to give a reasonable forecast of the future of a completion based on only a small amount of actual information about that particular well; the rest it draws from what it has seen before. By combining a GM with an algorithm for statistical inference, it is possible to make accurate forecasts that include quantified uncertainty bounds. The combination of a forecast and uncertainty leads to powerful new ways of looking at future production including Forecast Certainty Maps.|",""

The core region of the Barnett Shale play in eastern Tarrant and western Dallas Counties, Texas, has prime development potential. This stems from a combination of maximum target thickness of 450 to 500 and a thick Viola Limestone, affording a significant barrier to Ellenberger water production. Structural complexity increases approaching the Ouachita Thrust belt to the east, as reflected in increased variability in Barnett natural fractures and rock stress properties. 
Borehole image logs from 3 horizontal wells in the Barnett reveal significant variability in natural fracturing, faults and drilling induced fracture distribution along their laterals. The presence or absence of drilling induced transverse and longitudinal fractures can be directly linked to the changes in frac gradient and proppant placement during the fracture treatments and flowback response. A geomechanical study of all 3 wells identified the geometry of critically-stressed fractures and faults. Variation in differential stress along the lateral and changes in the geometry of critically-stressed fractures and faults can significantly alter the induced hydraulic fracture response (complex vs. planar fractures) in these stages, ultimately governing production response. 
We developed criteria to use drilling induced fracture patterns from horizontal borehole image data to optimize the fracture stage design, custom fitting the stimulation to lateral changes in stress anisotropy. 
From production histories, we show that stage-by-stage modification of the pump-ins, accommodating borehole image log-derived information, was able to improve frac efficiency and EUR, even in highly fractured laterals.|",""

The Denver-Julesburg Basin in northern Colorado is an unconventional hydrocarbon play utilizing horizontal wells to access several targets, known locally as benches, including the Niobrara B-Chalk. The need to navigate and optimally place completion packers in the unconventional play with complex, laminated rock structure and sub-seismic faulting is important to effectively stimulate reservoir rock for increasing production potential. While bulk gamma is primarily used to correlate the formation, more-advanced real-time logging-while-drilling (LWD) technology is proposed to navigate effectively and maintain the wellbore within the specific target chalk. High-resolution LWD electrical images are also employed to optimize the completion strategy and confirm real-time interpretation. This paper illustrates how real-time LWD information can be used to improve overall production by using this data-driven approach. An azimuthal gamma ray image was used to determine formation bed dip and stratigraphic complexity, along with two different resistivity measurements to correlate position within the reservoir. The data was transmitted in real time to a remote geo-steering center where a reservoir navigation engineer incorporated the data into the geological model and provided the operator with real-time steering recommendations for remaining within the zone of interest. In addition, the data were used to identify faults and interpret the fault-throw direction and distance. The well was drilled with 85% of the lateral section placed in a 10-ft-thick target zone, compared to fewer than 50% in offset wells navigating with gamma only. This was accomplished despite crossing over one sub-seismic fault and relative formation dips that varied from 88 to 92 degrees. The improved net-to-gross was a result of the utilization of azimuthal gamma, multiple propagation resistivity, and the real-time reservoir navigation service (RNS). The increased in-zone footage indicated this method provided a significant advantage over gamma-only measurements when navigating such complex and faulted formations. Post-well, the high-resolution LWD electrical image logs were used to confirm the faults and determine packer placement for optimal completion efficiency. This lesson learnt can be applied to most unconventional plays around the world.|",""

Granular porous material is idealized as an elastic-plastic material, where macroscopic failure occurs at a critical stress by localized dilatant shear at low effective pressure and compactional cataclastic flow at high effective pressure. Yielding and accumulation of microscopic damage at sub-critical stress levels are also important characteristics of the failure process. Here, load-reload triaxial compression tests are used to investigate damage development at low and high effective pressures, and test models of yield across the brittle-ductile transition. Water saturated cylinders of Berea sandstone were deformed at an axial strain rate of 10-5 s-1 and effective pressures of 20-240 MPa to investigate the dilational, transitional, and compactional regimes. Results illustrate that contours of equivalent damage for sub-critical stress states between yield and macroscopic failure are sub-parallel to the failure envelope except in the highest pressure regime. Damage induced at one effective pressure has a systematic, but variable effect on failure at other effective pressure conditions. The behavior across the transition from dilation to compaction is most consistent with a model based on two distinct yield envelopes, each associated with distinct damage mechanisms and a sharp transition between the low and high pressure regimes.|","Document Type

The Pillar Mountain Landslide occurred in 1971 near the City of Kodiak, Alaska. The slide comprised 6 million cubic yards of material that failed from above the main highway to town and covered the roadway. Since the failure was progressive in nature it was not a catastrophic event, and it did cut off the City from the airport and shipping port for long. The roadway was rehabilitated with little other damaged noted. Of concern to the resident of Kodiak is the presence of ongoing rockfall that is occurring from the same slide area. It is not known with certainty if the rockfall is a precursor of further sliding activity and / or larger deep seated failure. It is also of concern that a large slide could result in a tsunami that could cause substantial damage to Kodiak beyond just closing the Highway into town. Many studies of the slide have been undertaken but none of them adequately explain the mechanism responsible for the 1971 failure.
This paper proposes an alternate failure mechanism for the 1971 failure and uses this to predict the potential for future failures. In general the structural geology in the vicinity of the 1971 Pillar Mountain slide is favorable with bedding dipping into the slope and some sub-vertical joint sets dissecting the blocky rock mass. It is postulated that the 1971 failure was initiated by oversteepening and loss of confinement at the toe of the slope as a result of quarrying activity. This may have resulted in dilation at the toe of the slope followed by flexural toppling failure. As a consequence of flexure of continuous columns of rock (separated by bedding) the tensile strength of the rock may have been exceeded. Once the tensile fractures started to coalesce at the base of the topping beds (failure perpendicular to bedding) it is postulated that slippage started on the rough but coalesced surface that dipped out of the slope in the oversteeped section of the slope. This mechanism and modeling undertaken to visualize and validate the mechanism are described in this paper. The results of modeling this mechanism are also described in the paper.|","Document Type

The deformability tests conducted by using plate jacking test, plate loading test, Goodman jack test and laboratory test show the comparison among different measurements and scale effects on deformability of rock mass. Plate load test, flat jack test and Goodman jack test give values of modulus of deformation which are 2-3 times lower than large size plate jacking test. Hence, large size plate jacking test must be utilized to evaluate the modulus of deformation of rock mass, particularly due to jointing in Himalayan rock mass.

Understanding the interaction of drilling fluid with shale formation is critical to properly describe pore pressure propagation which directly affects the wellbore stability. In the case of reactive shale formations, it has been shown that clay minerals within shale matrix have a tendency to adsorb water from drilling fluid. Using a concentrated drilling fluid, available models which are based on the ideal solution assumption fail to properly address the true shale-drilling fluid interaction. It is shown that the moisture content of shale is correlated with water activity using the multilayer adsorption theory. It is found that the GAB model fairly well describes the adsorption process for the selected shale types. The adsorption parameter signifies the characteristic of specific shale to interact with aqueous fluids. The constitutive equations are generalized to consider the case of non-ideal solutions. The coupled transport equations are solved using a finite difference method and numerical computations are conducted to predict the stability of the wellbore. Having developed a transient model which predicts the instantaneous moisture content around the wellbore, it is possible to update the compressive strength of shale as a function of its moisture content using the empirical correlations already proposed in the literature. The proposed model predicts that due to the moisture transport, the range of safe mud weight reduces substantially. The results of this investigation assist in drilling fluid design and address wellbore stability issues in troublesome shale formations.|","Document Type

Hydrocarbon extraction from unconventional oil and gas reservoirs requires more accurate ways to describe fracture processes in shale. Fracture initiation, propagation and coalescence has been studied in many rock-like materials [1,2] and natural rocks [1,2,3] . However, shale is typically heterogeneous and anisotropic with naturally formed bedding planes. Natural bedding planes can be weak zones where fractures can initiate and propagate along [1, 2, 3]. A series of unconfined compression tests were conducted on Opalinus clay shale with two pre-existing flaws and various bedding plane orientations (0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees with respect to the horizontal). High speed and high resolution imagery were use to capture fracture initiation, propagation and coalescence between the flaw pairs. Distinct coalescence and cracking patterns were observed when compared to previously tested rocks. As the bedding angle increased, fractures initiating at the flaw tips tended to propagate more frequently along the bedding planes. Coalescence of cracks between flaws trended from direct-combined (tensile and shear cracks) to indirect as the bedding plane angle increased. Tensile crack initiation and coalescence stresses showed a characteristic U-shape profile with a minimum at 60 degree bedding plane orientation and a maximum at 0 degree bedding plane orientation.|","Document Type

Numerical simulations have been conducted to model the deformation, damage, and fracture growth caused by the plunge of a spherical drill bit insert into a brittle rock. The deformation of the rock, which is initially homogeneous and isotropic, is modeled using the finite element method. Fracture geometry evolves as a function of fracture growth, and the rock domain is continuously re-meshed to capture this geometric change. Contact forces are applied radially over the contact area as a function of the depth of the plunge. A series of simulations is presented, having varying initial flaw distributions, and which capture the fracture pattern formation during the progressive indentation of the insert into the rock. The ensuing patterns depict the formation of horizontal and Hertzian fractures. A large fracture density is created around the contact area. The complexity of the internal fracture structure is less apparent at the surface of the deformed rock, as compared to the internal fracture pattern. Fracturing leads to the formation of surface chips in the form of tilted elliptical domains parallel to the rock surface. Early stages of chipping are not always apparent from the fracture pattern at the surface of the rock. Results are in good agreement with experimental observations.|","Document Type

A bimodal depth distribution of fluid-injection-induced microearthquakes (MEQs) was observed in the 2012 stimulation phase of the Newberry Volcano Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) Demonstration project in Oregon. During 7 weeks of hydraulic stimulation of well NWG 55-29, 90% of MEQs occurred in the shallow reservoir while few occurred adjacent to the expected deep stimulation zone. This enigmatic distribution of MEQs may have resulted from two alternative possible causes: (1) A segment of the casing may be damaged, the resulting leak introducing a new fluid source with the pressure triggering microseismicity in the shallow reservoir over the short term; or (2) fluid pressures may have migrated upwards from the deep injection zone to the shallow reservoir to induce local seismic events. Our analysis of the failure potential of the reservoir to fluid-injection indicates that the failure potential increases with reduced depth for a given wellhead pressure. The timing of pore-pressure diffusion suggests that upward-migration of fluid pressures from the injection zone cannot generate critical overpressures in the shallow zone of seismicity sufficiently quickly. This contention, favoring the role of a ruptured casing, is further supported by a coupled Thermal-Hydrological-Mechanical (THM) analysis and the observation (August 2013) that indeed the casing is damaged at shallow depth. Despite this, still unexplained remains the presence of seismicity at great depth, but absent at intermediate depth.|","Document Type

A new method is proposed for reading local deformation of granular material by using reflection of light. In this method, two plastic optical fibers, both having diameter of 1mm, are used to read local disturbance or deformation at a point in granular material, such as sand, soil, or broken rocks. As light is sent into the 1st fiber and reaches its end, it leaves the fiber and hits surfaces of nearby particles. Part of the reflected light then gets into the 2nd fiber, which can be digitally measured by using photo diode. The paper introduces the fundamental mechanism of how the system works, shows several examples in which the proposed method is tested to interpret deformation of granular material, passage of water or air bubble, collapse of mass of granular materials, and so on. The results shows interesting relation between local deformation of granular material red by light and overall behavior of the mass made of those particles.|","Document Type

Proppant additives play an essential role in hydraulic fracturing as they provide support, which retains the fracture opening after the pumping is shut off. From a production point of view, a larger proppant size provides better permeability, while, at the same time, gravitational settling may cause significant distortion of the particle distribution inside the fracture for heavier particles. This study uses a recently developed model for proppant transport, that has been implemented for Khristianovich-Zheltov- Geertsma-De Klerk (KGD) and pseudo-3D (P3D) fracture geometries, to quantify the effect of particle settling. The proppant transport model is based on an empirical constitutive relation for the slurry that accounts for: i) a non-uniform particle distribution across the fracture width due to shear-induced migration, which distorts the parabolic velocity profile, ii) slip velocity in the direction of flow, which, in the limit of a jammed state, leads to Darcys law, and iii) gravitational settling. While the gravitational settling is the biggest concern when dealing with larger particle sizes, other effects may include earlier jamming due to proppant stalling in between the walls and higher permeability of the proppant plug, which promotes the fracture propagation in front of the jammed region.|","Document Type

Rock anisotropy is one of the most distinctive features that must be considered in rock mechanics. In this study, two-dimensional discrete element simulations are conducted to investigate the strength and deformation behavior of inherently anisotropic rocks which display different behaviors in response to load with respect to the different orientations of the plane of weakness. In the numerical model, intact rock is represented by bonding rigid particles at their contacts together. The inherent anisotropy is modeled by artificially removing any parallel bonds dipping around a certain angle to the loading direction and replacing them with smooth joint contacts. The numerical model is validated by comparing the strength and elastic modulus with previous experimental results. The failure patterns can be classified into: split cross weak layers, shear along weak layers and split along weak layers, which also agree with that observed in laboratory. The angle range plays an important role on the response of numerical model which can be used to represent the degree of anisotropy. The numerical model proposed in this study provides a new way to investigate the mechanical behavior of anisotropic rock. Future studies can be carried out to investigate the strength criterion of anisotropic rock based on this approach.|","Document Type

The mechanical properties of rocks are essential for analysis of different problems during oil and gas drilling and production and future development. These properties are required for borehole stability, sand production, and select optimum flow rate during the completion stage and many other problems related with the short and long term mechanical stability of the well and the reservoir. The correct predictions may help in saving millions of dollars in drilling and completions costs, and may allow preventing long term and costly consequences. A common problem in oil and gas industry is the unavailability of the real core samples. To overcome this problem the engineers struggle to develop alternative sources of data via correlations, log measurements, etc. In this study, a simple scratching cell was developed and data produced was used to develop a correlation for predicting the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) for Saudi Arabian rocks. 
The output of this paper is a great addition to the rock mechanics and petroleum engineering disciplines especially in Borehole instability problems during drilling of oil and gas wells.|","Document Type

Microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing has provided great value for understanding hydraulic fracturing in unconventional reservoirs, including measurement of fracture geometry and optimization of stimulations, completions, and field development. Nevertheless, microseismic monitoring is a complex endeavor and many issues of fielding, analysis, uncertainty, and geophysics should be carefully assessed. The geomechanics of the generation of microseismicity are still being investigated, as well as the source mechanisms and how it all relates to the fracturing process. Besides the value for field development and resource recovery, microseismic monitoring has also proved useful for evaluating environmental and safety issues. Data from thousands of fractures show that the levels of induced seismicity in typical relaxed sedimentary basins are well below any levels that would be of concern for safety or damage. Similarly, data from thousands of fractures show that hydraulic fractures in shale reservoirs do not propagate into aquifers.|","Document Type

In this paper, the results of laboratory studies of hydraulic fracture in homogeneous sandstone blocks with man-made interfaces and heterogeneous shale blocks with weak natural interfaces are reported. Tests were conducted under similar stress conditions, with fluids of different viscosity and at different injection rates. The measurements and analysis allows the identification of fracture initiation and behavior. Fracturing with high viscosity fluids resulted in stable fracture propagation initiated before breakdown, while fracturing with low viscosity fluids resulted in unstable fracture propagation initiated almost simultaneously with breakdown. Analysis also allows us to measure the fluid volume entering the fracture and the fracture volume. Monitoring of Acoustic Emission (AE) hypocenter localizations, indicates the development of created fractured area including the intersection with interfaces, fluid propagation along interfaces, crossing interfaces, and approaching the boundaries of the block. We observe strong differences in hydraulic fracture behavior, fracture geometry and fracture propagation speed, when fracturing with water and high viscosity fluids. We also observed distinct differences between sandstone blocks and shale blocks, when a certain P-wave velocity ray path is intersected by the hydraulic fracture. The velocity increases in sandstones and decreases in shale.|","Document Type

Polygonal Fault Systems (PFS) are increasingly observed in seismic data of the subsurface. These unusual networks of normal faults are known to develop over vast areas in fine-grained sequences which in many cases may form the regional caprock. Consequently, there is the potential for PFS to compromise the integrity of these sequences with obvious implications for subsurface fluid migration. The processes leading to the formation of PFS remain poorly understood, although their confinement to particular sediment packages and spatial extent are powerful arguments for a constitutive control. The work presented here attempts to progress recent efforts examining a diagenetic trigger for polygonal fault genesis. More specifically, investigations of diagenetically sourced structure development in mudstones have been undertaken in order to formulate a geomechanical argument to explain their formation. This argument is tested in finite strain computational models using the geomechanical code ELFEN, so that the formation over geological time can be studied. Prediction of PFS in both two and three dimensions are presented that demonstrate that this modelling approach can predict realistic PFS geometries including the observed transition from random to preferential fault alignment with increasing degree of stress anisotropy.|","Document Type

We investigate the main pumping parameters that influence a fluid driven fracture in cohesive poroelastoplastic weak formation. These parameters include the fluid viscosity and the injection rate. The first parameter dominates in the mapping of the propagation regimes from toughness to viscosity while the second parameter controls the storage to leak-off dominated regime through diffusion.
The fracture is driven in weak permeable formation by injecting an incompressible viscous fluid at the fracture inlet assuming plane strain conditions. Fluid flow in the fracture is modeled by lubrication theory. Irreversible rock deformation is modeled with the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion assuming associative flow rule. Fracture propagation criterion is based on the cohesive zone approach. Leak-off is also considered. We perform numerical calculations with the finite element method to obtain the fracture opening, length and propagation pressure versus time.
We demonstrate that pumping parameters influence the fracture geometry and fluid pressures in weak formations through the diffusion process that create back stresses and large plastic zones as the fracture propagates. We also show that the product of propagation velocity and fluid viscosity, (<U+03BC>v) that appears in the scaling controls the magnitude of the plastic zones and influences the net pressure and fracture geometry.|","Document Type

Produced water re-injection (PWRI) is often the safest and most economical method for disposal of produced water in the oil industry. Two key issues that affect the management of PWRI are the formation damage and the constrained pumping pressure at the wellhead. A simulator was developed to handle the design of single-zone or multi-zone water injection in multilayered reservoirs. The simulator can accommodate both vertical and horizontal wells operated under matrix and/or fractured regimes. It is also able to account for the impact of formation damage and user-defined wellhead pressure constraints. Results obtained from the simulator showed good agreement with known injection behaviors. For vertical wells, injection conformance depends on KH (permeability-thickness) and the minimum horizontal stress; in the case of multi-fractured horizontal wells, the outermost fractures (those near the tip and the heel of the horizontal well) are longer than the fractures in the middle. Lastly, by constraining the maximum allowable surface pressure, frictional pressure drops in both the wellbore and fracture cause the injection rate to decline, which in turn affects both the fracture geometry and the maximum disposal volumes.|","Document Type

This paper presents a novel technique for assessment of fracture and injection domain geometry from fall off tests. Using type curve analysis techniques established in part for long term water injection, algorithms were developed for assessment of geomechanical and fracture properties of injectors. These properties include the stress contrast between the injection and containment layers, the rate of fracture shrinkage (height and/or length) during fall off, the extent of the inner relative permeability domain and outer domain, and others.
A software tool was developed to incorporate these algorithms. The tool was used to analyze fall-off test results obtained from a large-scale slurry injection operation used for disposal of drilling wastes in Alaskas North Slope. The software tools predicted fracture height showed very good agreement to the height interpreted from temperature logs conducted by the operator in the well.|","Document Type

In order to deepen the comprehension of the stress-strain behavior of 'clean halite' and 'argillaceous halite' from the WIPP, 20 core samples were left to the Institute of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering of the Technische Universitat Braunschweig. The experimental data is obtained to derive material parameters for high-quality material models which describe the stress- and time-deformation behavior of the two salt facies. Rock salt shows a brittle fracture behavior at the used strain rate of 1.0 10-5 s-1. With a low confining pressure the specimens reach the ultimate strength followed by the typical post failure behavior of rock salt. A volume expansion is already observable below the ultimate stress state, i.e. to a loosening of the specimen by dilatancy and micro-cracking. The volumetric strain rate will be at its maximum when the fracture stress is reached. The visual impression shows a clear difference between the two types of salt. Therefore, the salt facies are likely to show a different stressstrain behavior, because in each case different fracture mechanisms should dominate. But this impression cannot be confirmed by the conducted experiments.|","Document Type

Re-Injection is one of the most important methods to dispose fluid associated with oil and natural gas production. Disposed fluids include produced water, hydraulic fracture flow back fluids, and drilling mud fluids. Several formation damage mechanisms are associated with the injection including damage due to filter cake formed at the formation face, bacteria activity, fluid incompatibility, free gas content, and clay activation.
Fractured injection is typically preferred over matrix injection because a hydraulic fracture will enhance the well injectivity and extend the well life. In a given formation, the fracture dimensions change with different injection flow rates due to the change in injection pressures. Also, for a given flow rate, the skin factor varies with time due to the fracture propagation. In this study, well test and injection history data of a Class II disposal well in south Texas were used to develop an equation that correlates the skin factor to the injection flow rate and injection time. The results show that with time, the skin factor decreases until such a point at which the fracture dimensions are sufficient without further propagation to handle the injected water volume (stationary fracture). A constant skin factor is noted after this point. At higher injection flow rates, the constant skin factor achieved is lower because of the larger fracture dimensions developed at higher injection flow rates.|","Document Type

The direct and Brazilian tension tests are the most popular methods for measuring the tensile strength of rocks. While the values of tensile strength obtained from these test are theoretically expected to be identical, the accumulated experimental data show that the direct tensile strength is different from the Brazilian tensile strength in most cases. In an attempt to explore the potential reasons for such discrepancy, the direct and Brazilian tension tests are compared in the light of size effect and bimodularity. The problem of size effect is investigated using the two approaches of statistical theory of strength and linear elastic fracture mechanics. The effect of bimodularity of the material on the induced stresses in the tension tests is also examined. Based on the effect of size and bimodularity, equations have been derived to relate the direct and Brazilian tensile strength. The results of the direct, Brazilian and fracture toughness tests on Lac de Bonnet granite were used to validate the equations.|","Document Type

This laboratory investigation involved evaluating the potential to enhance drilling Rate of Penetration (ROP) and drilling efficiency by applying axial vibrations on the bit using a pulse cavitation drilling tool in combination with varying levels of axial compliance. The pulse cavitation tool generates cavitation bubbles in the drilling fluid by flowing through a venturi. When the cavitation bubbles produced within the tool are collapsed, pressure pulses are generated which produce pressure pulsations and oscillatory forces on the bit. Drilling results were evaluated on the basis of ROP, Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE), bit loads and bit displacements. The tool was tested both with and without compliance to evaluate the effects of the compliant element. Experimental results show that the pulse cavitation tool starts to cavitate and produce vibrations when a critical flow rate is reached. When the drilling system was rigid (i.e. no compliance was used), the vibration produced did not have any significant effect on the ROP. However, when the drilling system was compliant the vibrations produced by the tool intensified the natural displacement vibration of the compliant element and the ROP was increased and MSE was decreased.|","Document Type

Because of autogenous shrinkage of cement and the subsequent reduction in radial contact stress between the borehole wall and the cement, a micro-annulus may develop that creates a pathway by which natural gas may rise outside the casing. This gas may become evident as sustained casing pressure (SCP) in the US, or in Canada as surface casing vent flow (SCVF) or as gas migration (GM), i.e., that which occurs outside the casing strings. GM may emit at ground surface as a greenhouse gas or penetrate shallow aquifers causing groundwater contamination. Several observers have noted that gas emissions recorded as surface casing vent releases display a pulsing or periodic nature, which is of consequence if such emissions are to be monitored. We hypothesize that these pulses are due to the formation of Taylor bubbles, i.e., gas slugs, which are created by the coalescence of small bubbles. Their displacement pressure is sufficient to overcome the capillary entry pressure posed by shallow aquifers and thus cause groundwater contamination.|","Document Type

In order to construct mountain tunnels rationally and safely, observational construction method has been employed. The necessity for such observation relating to the behavior of tunnel and surrounding ground means that there are so many uncertainties in the tunnel construction process. Uncertainties are inaccuracy in the geological survey before construction start, many assumptions in the design of tunnel supports, difference between design and constructed result and so on. Especially rock mass classification is important, because a design of tunnel supports and tunneling method is carried out based on the pre-investigated result under the condition of budget and construction period. However the item in pre-investigation might be limited. And rock mass class selected in the design is often different from that of actual condition. In this paper, rock mass classification result based on the advancing boring from tunnel face is compared with actually constructed rock mass class. Authors also discussed about rock mass classification process with geological engineers who have had many experiences in pre-investigation and advancing boring. As a result, it was suggested that rock mass classification table given in the standard cannot exactly provide a good result. So rock mass classification process should be examined in detail and a new scheme to have more reliable classification results should be discussed.|","Document Type

In this paper, dependence of the tangential component of the coefficient of restitution on the incoming angle and the surface friction angle is examined under the normal component being kept constant. A small scale laboratory test is reported to get a better understanding during/at impact. Under the condition in which the normal component has set to be (roughly) constant, it has been recognized that the tangential component of the coefficient restitution Ret is a roughly constant when the incoming angle is small and then increases with the increase in the slope angle. This nature of impact is explained by sticking behavior and the transition to slippage. In the transition zone, the ratio of Er/Ev (rotational/translational energy) has been decreased, however, we cannot conclude that this transition behavior result in the apparent friction reduction with the momentum or sticking with some slippage during the contact.|","Document Type

This paper demonstrates the ability of a 2D independent two-phase flow hydro-mechanical (H-M) simulator, FLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua), to predict H-M responses related to Co2 injection in subsurface disposal reservoirs. This is the first paper to study the use of FLAC as a single H-M simulator for Co2 injection processes. The models in FLAC are tested against twoexistingmodels: (1)a prototype Co2injectionreservoirand(2)the InSalahgas fieldinAlgeria.The H-M responses such as the spread of Co2 plumes, the history of pore pressure increases, and surface uplifts are presented and compared with the results from the reference models. The potential for mechanical failures and leakage are also analyzed using critical pressure approach. The simulations show that FLAC models are able to capture typical shapes of Co2 plumes in the reservoirs. The history of pore pressure increase and a typical bell-shape for surface uplifts are obtained. The potential location for mechanical failures and leakage is also well predicted. Future implementation of H-M stress-dependent properties in FLAC will improve its capability. Hence, coupling this software with other fluid flow simulator such in the literatures may no longer be necessary in the future.|","Document Type

Many studies have been conducted on the size effects behavior of intact rocks and the majority of them have focused on a standard ratio of length to diameter (slenderness ratio) as determined by the International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM). The main aim of this research was to investigate the correlation between slenderness ratio and the mechanical properties of Gosford sandstone over a much broader range of slenderness ratios. The data showed that there was a general descending trend for the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) as slenderness ratio increased. Similarly, Youngs Modulus displayed a descending trend with increasing slenderness ratio. No discernible correlation could be established between Poissons ratio and slenderness ratio. Also, it was revealed that single shearing and vertical splitting were the dominant failure modes for Gosford sandstone samples with different diameter and slenderness ratio.|","Document Type

Strain localization in the form of compactive shear bands or compaction bands is often observed in high porosity rocks such as sandstones or limestones. In the present study, we theoretically investigate the possibility of strain localization in a high-porosity carbonate rock (calcarenite) by means of a continuum mechanics approach. A critical state elasto-plastic constitutive model has been employed for this purpose. We examine the constitutive and structural response by solving boundary value problems (BVPs) for calcarenite specimens subjected to axisymmetric loading conditions. In order to perform the numerical simulation in the post localization regime, the model is enhanced with a rate dependent regularization scheme. The results demonstrate that material heterogeneity, kinematic constraints and boundary effects govern the formation of various modes of localized deformation in the transitional regime between brittle fracture and ductile faulting. Indeed, the predicted macroscopic response is found to be in good agreement with observations available in the literature.|","Document Type

A new methodology was developed to estimate a rock discontinuity roughness using LiDAR data collected from the 4850-ft level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) at the former Homestake Gold Mine, Lead, SD. Mapteks I-Site Studio and Vulcan 3D mine modeling software packages were used for the analysis. The data was obtained using a Z&F IMAGER 5006h LiDAR scanner that had a maximum resolution of 0.01mm. Data preparation was performed in I-site Studio and the points were triangulated to create a surface. The analytical data consisted of ten rectangular point clouds of dimensions of about 1.1 m by 0.56 m. The triangulated surface was imported into Vulcan where data analyses were performed. Results indicated that this method yields a useful way of estimating the roughness of a 3D rock surface by considering orientation (slope) of triangular facets making up the surface. Using the slope angles the surface roughness parameter Z2swas readily determined and correlated with the JRC, resulting in an empirical model that indicated the robustness of the method.|","Document Type

Experiments were made under two uniaxial stresses 0 and 3 MPa and by using three types of fluids: viscous oil, water and liquid carbon dioxide (L- Co2). As for results, from the crack observation and AE source distribution, in the experiments used water and oil as fracturing fluid, fractures extend along the sedimentary plane if tests were run without loading, while they extend along the loading direction normal to the sedimentary plane under the uniaxial loading. These results suggest that the direction of crack extension is strongly affected by in-situ stress condition. However, the L- Co2 fracturing didnt show this tendency, this might be related to the low viscosity of L- Co2.

Discrete element method (DEM) has been proved to be a great tool to simulate and analyze the behavior of rock material. However, classic DEM using symmetrical particles bears the intrinsic limitation of severely overestimating the tensile strength of cohesive-frictional material and causing unrealistically low unconfined compressive strength (UCS) to tensile strength (T) ratio. This paper proposes a new contact model which properly considers the contribution of moments to the contact stresses and the condition at which the contact fails. The contact model has been implemented in the three-dimensional Particle Flow Code (PFC3D) and the detailed parametric study indicates that the moment contribution to the contact stresses is a major factor affecting the UCS/T ratio of PFC specimens. After decreasing the moment contribution parameter to be smaller than 0.5, a wide range of UCS/T ratios can be achieved by using different cohesion and tensile strength values. This new contact model has been used to simulate the behavior of Lac Du Bonnet (LDB) granite and Carrara marble and satisfactory UCS/T ratios agreeing with the measured values are obtained.|","Document Type

Tri-axial hydraulic fracturing experiments using supercritical Co2 (SC- Co2), water and viscous oil have been conducted in order to investigate how the viscosity of fracturing fluid affects fracture propagation and fracture mode. We performed these experiments on cubic granite specimens and monitored acoustic emission (AE) with 16 sensors. AE data analysis allows us to clarify fracture propagation and its mode. The effects of fluid viscosity on the distribution of AE sources and the fracture mode are discussed. Macroscopic observations of the surface fractures were consistent with located AE sources. The distribution of AE sources indicated that fracturing with low viscosity fluid such as SC- Co2 can induce more widely and complexly extending fractures than those with higher viscosity fluid like water and oil. In addition, the analysis of the fracture mechanism showed that low viscosity fluid such as SC- Co2 induces shear dominant fracture, while high viscosity fluid induces tensile dominant fracture. Thus, since Co2 has a higher affinity to shale than methane and enhances methane desorption, Co2 fracturing could be an effective technique particularly for shale gas recovery.|","Document Type

Stability of large room-and-pillar panels, which is a function of mechanical response of typically large number of pillars and deformation of the overburden on the scale of the entire panel, could be a challenging problem to analyze because it requires consideration of deformation and damage of rock mass occurring at different length scales. Panel stability is a function of response of both pillars and the overburden, and when the room-and-pillar panels collapse very often it is not clear if it is a consequence of pillar or overburden failure. Two-scale analysis approach is presented here. Pillars are analyzed first in a pillar-scale model with necessary discretization to represent stress-strain concentrations and high-strain gradients. The derived pillar stress-strain curves then are used in the panel-scale analysis of deformation and stress redistribution over the panel, in which the pillars are represented in an average sense (on the level of tributary area). The methodology for approximation of pillar response and calculation of pillar average properties is presented in the paper. Further, the ground-reaction curve approach is proposed for stability assessment of room-and-pillar panels.|","Document Type

In-situ stress magnitude and orientation have long been analyzed separately using classical statistics, despite the fact that stress is a tensor, and it should be analyzed using tensor-related methods. In this paper we investigate the applicability of a two dimensional aleatory model that can handle the stress tensor as a single entity. Firstly, a multivariate normal distribution of tensor components is assumed and the marginal probability functions of the eigen-parameters (principal stresses and rotational angle) derived. Using published in-situ stress data, random stress tensors are generated to compare the distributions of eigen-parameters obtained using classical and tensor statistics. We conclude that for stress magnitude, these two methods give the identical results, whereas for orientation only tensor statistics gives the correct result. Additionally, it is only tensor statistics that is invariant with regard to orientation of the coordinate system. Therefore, we conclude that in practical cases that deal only with stress magnitude, either method can give reliable result, but any analysis involving principal stress orientation requires tensor statistics.|","Document Type

Assessment of underground rock wedge instability is a common problem in tunnelling and mining operations, and particularly during the early stages of a project may need to be performed when little or no objectively measured information is available. Such lack of information represents epistemic uncertainty, and although it is often analysed using an aleatory (e.g. probabilistic) model, this is known to be inappropriate. Here, we use the vertex method  an extension of interval mathematics  to show how epistemic uncertainty can be propagated through the analysis.

Many parameters used in rock engineering design are characterized using objectively measured data, although at early design stages there often may be insufficient data available (epistemic uncertainty) to define the parameter in question. In such instances, the design process could benefit from the use of Bayesian statistics where informative priors can be constructed from expert knowledge and then updated as further test data become available. In this paper we use small sample sizes of uniaxial compressive strength as an exemplar parameter that exhibits epistemic uncertainty to show how the Bayesian updating takes place. We then use the example of the analysis of rock spalling around an underground opening to show how the results of Bayesian analysis can be used to improve estimates of strength, leading to improved analysis of probability of failure.|","Document Type

In this paper we apply to intact rock the four-parameter polyaxial criterion originally proposed by Ottosen [1] for modelling the peak strength of concrete. The Ottosen criterion is fitted to strength data at both the triaxial compression and triaxial extension stress states, and we use previously published polyaxial data sets to show how this might be done for rock. Additionally, a novel relation between the 2D Hoek-Brown (HB) criterion [2] and the Ottosen criterion is presented, and we show how this permits the use of the HB parameter m in place of polyaxial test data to determine the four parameters that govern the Ottosen criterion. We suggest that the Ottosen criterion is capable of modelling polyaxial rock strength with reasonable accuracy, generally within ±10%..|","Document Type

A better understanding of the energy budget has important implications for enhancing the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing treatments. In particular, what percentage of the input treatment energy is released as radiated energy? What characterizes the deformation of the failure?
We use a bonded-particle modeling approach to investigate both the radiated energy release and the amount of brittle failure. To test our model, we simulate triaxial compression tests on calibrated sandstone samples. Our results show that much of the failure is marked by a tensile component, despite the development of one or two large shear planes crosscutting the samples. Additionally, only 2.5% of the input energy is radiated as seismic waves. We propose an updated empirical energy-magnitude relation: log ER = 1.9MW +8.5, where ER is the radiated energy and MW is the event moment magnitude. This relation is an alternative to the commonly used Kanamori relationship and more applicable for the small-magnitude acoustic emissions in triaxial tests and likely microseismic events in hydraulic fracturing experiments, which are both marked by strong tensile deformation. Close examination of the source mechanisms of the induced acoustic emissions reinforce the complex nature of the micromechanics behind rock fracturing in general, due to strong deviations of the local stress field from the applied external field.|","Document Type

Integrity of the near-well area is crucial for preventing leakage between geological horizons and towards the surface during CO2 storage, hydrocarbon production and well stimulation. The paper consists of two parts. In the first part, a finite-element model of earlier laboratory tests on thermal cycling of a casing/cement/rock assemblage is set up. It is demonstrated that radial tensile stresses contributing to annular cement debonding are likely to develop during cooling of such an assemblage. The results of the modeling are in agreement with the results of the earlier laboratory experiments, with regard to the temperature histories, CT data, and location of acoustic emission sources. In the second part of the paper, a computational procedure is developed for upscaling of data about rock damage obtained from CT, to a finite-element model of flow in porous media around a well. The damaged zone is shown to dominate the flow along the axis of a compound specimen (a hollow cylinder of sandstone filled with cement).

A coupled simulator based on the MDEM fracturing code and the TOUGH2 reservoir simulator was used to study propagation of hydraulic fractures in a naturally-fractured formation under isotropic and anisotropic in-situ stress conditions. Offset of a propagating hydraulic fracture by a pre-existing natural fracture was observed in some of the simulations. In others, the hydraulic fracture was found to cross a natural fracture without any offset. A mesh-dependence was observed: changing the mesh geometry from regular to irregular affected the fracture pattern, even though the mesh resolution was approximately the same. The mesh dependence particularly affected the fracture pattern observed under isotropic in-situ stress field. The results of the study are of importance for practical application of hydraulic fracture simulation, in particular in gas shale reservoirs.|","Document Type

Rock as brittle heterogeneous material exhibits inelastic deformation due to widely pre-existing microcracks in the formation from outcrops to the cores thousands miles deep underground. By the effect of the geological process, thermalmechanical loading, hydraulic fracturing, etc., the macrocracks or fractures may be developed as the collection of microcracks. However, it is difficult to obtain the geometry of microscopic natural fractures and their kinematic information by physical experimentation. In this study, the Distinct Element Method (DEM) is used because it treats the rock mass as an assembly of independent particles under certain contacts, and along with deformation and dynamic mechanism. With Distinct Element Modeling approach, the rock mass is represented by three-dimensional bonded particles, and the pre-existing discontinuities (joints) are simulated by smooth-joint contact model. The observed existing fractures geometric properties have been identified that they are fitted to theoretical probability density functions. Therefore, the stochastic microcracks (SM) system needs to be investigated with Monte Carlo simulation by applying distinct distribution functions into geometry variables, such as crack density, orientation, location; which addresses the probabilistic characterization of the nature of fracture system. The rock sample is sent to anisotropic stress field to observe its response after simulated hydraulic fracturing. The model is also developed with two different parallel laminations of rock types to exam the mineral phases effect. This paper combine the Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic microcracks with Distinct Element Modeling using 3D Particle Flow Code (PFC), and the presented synthetic rock mass can be applied in further study on the statistical natural fractures system coupling with microseismic event, stress distribution estimation, and thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of the hydraulic fracturing.|","Document Type

Different from the usual lattice model, the discretized-VIB consists of unit bond cells. Each unit cell has a finite number of bonds and can have any geometry. These features make the discretized-VIB quite suitable for modeling rock with a meso-structure of grains. Because the unit cell is directly characterized by the particle force-displacement constitutive relation derived from the micro-bond potential, the discretized-VIB can directly simulate the dynamic fracture behaviors of finite deformation without any external fracture criterion. In the present paper, the heterogeneity of rock is accounted in discretized-VIB by assuming that the Youngs modulus of unit cell complies with the Weibull distribution law. By simulating a typical dynamic fracture branching example, it is suggested the present method can simulate dynamic fracture initiation, propagation and branching process without separate fracture criterion. It can capture the main characteristics of dynamic fracture in rock. The results also show that rock heterogeneity influences the trajectory of dynamic fracture. The more heterogeneous the rock, the more tortuous the fracture trajectory becomes.|","Document Type

The research problem of establishing a correlation between the Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) and the roughness parameter Z2 is re-visited in this paper. As in other comparable studies, the first step is to digitize the ten standard JRC profiles. An alternative approach of digitization based on the pixel analysis in Matlab is adopted to obtain the standard JRC profiles. The Z2values of the ten profiles are then calculated based on three sampling intervals (small, medium and large) and compared with the prior published ones. To investigate the effect of the finite profile thickness, a parameter called rta, which is the ratio of the mean profile thickness to the profile amplitude, is defined and calculated for each profile. Our studies also reveal that the value of Z2 does not increase monotonically with JRC. The fundamental cause of this local peak is analyzed, which deems to be related to the larger waviness, while a smaller degree of local roughness of profile 5 (JRC 8-10). To take both the local profile roughness and the larger scale waviness into account, a new empirical correlation is developed. The numeric values of the associated fitting parameters are then determined.|","Document Type

Conventional rock mechanics testing techniques typically involve the loading of samples and measurement of displacements or strains on the outer boundary of the specimen surface. Neutron diffraction based strain measurement techniques represent a unique and powerful tool for measuring the strain within geological materials under load. The structural variability and non-uniform crystallinity of geological materials, however, create many complexities in the intensity patterns that must be analyzed to quantify strains within the material. The attenuating and scattering properties of the pressure cell housing the sample further add difficulties to the data analysis. This paper describes the methods and process used to process neutron scattering data for strain measurement in geological materials. It is intended to provide a primer for those in the rock mechanics community that are interested in utilizing this technique along with additional discussion of neutron diffraction experimental factors that may affect data quality.|","Document Type

Multiple transverse hydraulic fractures are created simultaneously in each stage for economically viable production of hydrocarbons in shales. The spacing between fractures is an important component to consider when developing an optimum stimulation design. Another important aspect to consider, that is often overlooked, is the anisotropy of mechanical properties inherent in shales. This study aims to provide an insight into the controlling effects of fracture spacing and different levels of rock property anisotropy on the fracture aperture during simultaneous fracture initiation and propagation. Multiple fracture propagation is simulated using 3-Dimensional [3D] finite element models [FEM]. All simulations in this study include simultaneous propagation of four fractures in pre-defined planes using cohesive elements in a linear elastic medium. Numerous FEMs with varying spacing between fractures and varying levels of anisotropy are generated to analyze the effect of spacing and rock anisotropy on the fracture apertures of the edge fractures and center fractures. The multi-fracture propagation model used in this study is capable of showing the isolated influence of each parameter tested. The results show that there is a significant effect on the fracture widths of center and edge fractures across the entire range of fracture spacing considered in the study. The center fractures are more sensitive to changes in fracture spacing and changes in elastic moduli.|","Document Type

Strain-softening behavior has been identified as a reasonable approach to describe the post-failure behavior of coal. In this past research, the detailed post-failure behavior of the coal was primarily analyzed from specimens in the laboratory. These laboratory tests typically determined: the peak stress and strain, the residual stress and strain, and the post-failure modulus, all as a relationship of the width-to-height ratio of the specimen. In LaModel, the behavior of a strain-softening material is defined by two points on the stress strain curve: the point of peak stress and peak strain, and the point of residual stress and residual strain (followed by perfectly plastic behavior). Typically, the elements peak stress is determined by the stress gradient implied in the Mark-Bieniawski coal strength formula, and the residual stress was typically determined from the published equations of Karabin and Evanto (1999), which interpreted the residual stress response of the coal from a couple of case studies. In this paper, the field data from 9 different stress measurement sites in U.S and Australian coal mines are used to analyze the post-failure behavior of the coal. This analysis results in an equation with two input parameters which describes the observed post-failure coal behavior. These two parameters not only control the difference between the peak and residual stress as a function of width-to-height ratio, but also control the point of the shift from strain-softening to strain-hardening behavior in the pillar. Ultimately, the new post-failure model was implemented into LaModel and validated by back-analyzing the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse.|","Document Type

These possibilities have application in petroleum engineering as well as mining. Understanding naturally fractured rock (NFR) behavior leads to better predictions of rock mass response to HF treatment and induced fracture initiation and propagation. Natural fractures exist in many different states, are reactivated by stress and pressure changes, and have alterable mechanical properties (e.g. stiffness, shear strength), leading to complex behavior in shear, opening, and closing reactions to stress changes. This article presents some attempts to understand and address simulation of HF interacting with a NFR using the Distinct Element Method (DEM) to represent the NFR. To this end, a coupled hydro-mechanical analysis is applied via the Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC) software to model both rock and fracture behavior in the HF/NFR system. In the current study, a Voronoi tessellated continuum has been generated to evaluate the effect of the stress ratio on flow into the joints by changing the differential principal compressive stresses. Given the difference in in situ stresses, pore pressure distribution is monitored and the distribution of slip and opening of fractures at different stress field anisotropy is investigated during pressurized hydraulic injection. Based on simulations, pore pressure decreases in a uniform pattern around the injection point in the isotropic stress state; however, the pressure distribution tends to become strongly anisotropic under a stronger differential stress. In addition, both normal and shear displacements show an increasing trend toward anisotropy under stronger stress differences. Applications may ensue with better understanding, such that HF strategies for strongly differential stress fields may evolve to be substantially different than for near-isotropic stress fields, and similar conclusions may ensue for random NFR fabrics, compared to cases with strongly oriented natural fracture fabric.|","stress ratio,  DEM, Hydraulic fracturing,  Voronoi tessellation,  HF/NFR system,  pore pressure distribution,  UDEC"

Elastic properties such as Youngs modulus (E) are key controlling factors in the design of drilling and completion operations in conventional and unconventional reservoirs such as gas/oil shales and tight gas sands. Due to the high cost and long time needed for rock mechanics testing on core, it is not always possible to conduct traditional tests within the time frame from well drilling to well completion operations. In addition, shale cores are often naturally fractured and it can be difficult to acquire plugs. Here, we present a rapid, non-destructive, index method based on impulse for the determination of a coupled E and Poissons ratio, v E*= E/(1v2). A small mass (60g) with a spherical tip of radius 3.81 or 38.1 mm is dropped on a flat surface from 12-19 mm. The mass slightly deforms the core and then rebounds from the core. From a combination of Hertzian contacts and Impulse, the elastic properties can be determined from the force-time curve of the impact. Our results are compared against a variety of materials including metals, ceramics, plastics, other synthetics, and a variety of rocks. Using this method, E* can be determined at cm spacing for several meters of core in one day of testing.|","Document Type

The paper presents results of a micro-mechanical Discrete Element Method (DEM) study of the hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation in Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) performed using the Particle Flow Code (PFC). Hydraulic fracturing is the main means to stimulate and create flow paths to extract heat in hot dry rocks with insufficient permeability to inject and circulate fluids. Hydro-thermo-mechanical coupled modeling is performed to analyze stress and strain changes on fracturing from a wellbore for improving the understanding of the role of thermal stresses on fracture propagation processes and the resulting fracture geometry. Bonded particle model (BPM) that is used for modeling the mechanical response and fracturing of solids was modified for capturing mechanical effects of temperature difference between rock and fracturing fluid infiltration in the propagating fracture. Heat exchange between fluid and rock and fracture is fully coupled processes. As the fracture propagates from the pressurized borehole, both fluid and rock adjacent to a newly formed fracture change temperature. The results show that thermally induced stresses can significantly change the fracture initiation and the fracture propagation pattern. Thermal stresses cause shallow randomly oriented cracks. The study evaluated fracture geometry and orientation with respect to fracturing fluid temperature, viscosity, density, pressure, rock parameters and in-situ stress difference.|","Document Type

Selection of the appropriate rock failure criteria is one of the key steps in determining minimum drilling fluid density in wellbore stability analysis. Numerous failure criteria have been used for rock failure analysis but there is no common agreement of which failure criterion to use. In this paper, the thirteen most common rock failure criteria were compared. The rock failure criteria were evaluated for three lithologies. A statistical analysis was performed to determine the similarities and differences among the failure criteria. According to the results, Tresca, Von Mises, and Inscribed Drucker-Prager estimated the higher bounds for the minimum required mud weight for all cases. Although Circumscribed Drucker-Prager usually predicts the lower bounds for the minimum required mud weight, its results are in the middle range for hard formations with low internal angle of friction. Modified Lade, Modified Wiebols-Cook and Mogi-Coulomb provided similar results for the three cases studied, so these failure criteria may be used interchangeably without changing the results.|","Document Type

We present a numerical model for the simultaneous initiation and subsequent propagation of multiple transverse hydraulic fractures from a horizontal wellbore. In particular, we investigate the efficiency and robustness of the multistage hydraulic fracturing technique. We restrict the created hydraulic fractures to remain radial and planar but fully account for the stress interaction between fractures, the fluid flow in the wellbore and across the different perforation clusters which are modeled via a classical relation between the friction pressure drop and the flow rate entering a given fracture. The initiation is modeled from a radial notch of given initial length using linear elastic fracture mechanics. The solver models the complete pressurization of the wellbore, the initiation of the different fractures and their propagation and interactions. The split of the fluid between the different clusters is part of the solution at each time-step. We present some validations and a case study investigating the effect of a number of heterogeneities (in-situ stress etc.) on the robustness of the limited entry technique.|","Document Type

In this study, evolution of mechanical and hydraulic properties in Berea sandstone with initial porosity of 20 %: is examined quantitatively by replicating mineral trapping process within pore spaces. The artificially accelerated mineral trapping is achieved by injecting a grout, resulting in calcite precipitation. The amount of calcite precipitated can be controlled by changing the concentrations of the grout and the total injection volume. The preliminary experiments indicate that the change of the mechanical and hydraulic properties is significant even if the calcite amount is relatively small  the values of Youngs modulus/permeability increase/decrease with increase of the calcite amount. Specifically, the permeability decreases by one order of magnitude as the initial porosity of 20 % reduces to 18 %. This intense decrease of permeability may not be able to be replicated by existing numerical models, although distribution of the calcite precipitated within rock samples should be adequately examined because uniform distribution may not be achieved.|","Document Type

Natural fractures exist in shale plays. Whether these fractures contribute to flow, how they interact with hydraulic fractures, and how they are reactivated under in-situ stresses are three main questions in shale hydraulic fracturing. The objective of this paper is to integrate experimental results related to these questions. To this end, the permeability of cores with calcite-filled natural fractures and without natural fractures was measured. Next, the tensile strength and tensile fracture pattern of core plugs containing natural fractures at different orientations were examined by applying the Brazilian test method. Subsequently, the permeability of these tensile-failed samples was measured. The results of this study on Niobrara shale samples show that the calcite-filled fractures do not contribute to flow, yet they are planes of weakness for tensile failure depending on the orientation of the fracture. Once calcite-filled fractures are activated, they contribute to flow quite significantly even without proppant or shear displacement. The results of this study could be beneficial in other investigations related to complex fracture network.|",""

Salt rock is characterized by its very low porosity and permeability along with excellent mechanical deformability. These characteristics make it a good cap rock for many structural petroleum reservoirs, a good geological hydrocarbon storage, and a suitable host rock for poisonous and hazardous wastes. Over the past few decades, different laboratory experiments have revealed the complexity and variety of mechanical behaviors of salt rocks. Although the elasto-plastic mechanical properties of salt rock highly depend on its stress state and temperature, but they can also change with its composition. Therefore, different salt rocks around the world show wide ranges of mechanical behaviors and it necessitates more experimental data from different geological regions. In this study 26 rock salt samples, with two different levels of impurities, from the Central Iranian salt rock were collected and examined. A set of rock mechanics experiments, including uniaxial compression test, triaxial compression test, and dipole ultrasonic velocity measurements at elevated temperatures, were fulfilled. It was found that the amount of impurities significantly affect the rock salt mechanical behavior. The results suggest that unconfined compressive strength increases as the temperature increases, but the triaxial compressive strength and the ultrasonic wave velocities demonstrate more complex patterns.|","Document Type

A geomechanics study on the safe and economical extraction of the Craig Pillar at Morrison Mine was initiated in mid-2013. Historical and future mining at Morrison raised concerns that elevated in situ stress magnitudes would be encountered during pillar extraction. A multi stage FLAC3D model was developed to simulate historical mining and extraction sequence, and the model was qualitatively calibrated based on visual observations of stress induced rock mass damage. Following adequate calibration, forward projections of the pillar extraction were simulated to assess the potential for mine induced seismicity so that the associated risks, related to rock bursting and production difficulties, could be predicted, managed and mitigated. Areas of high risk were identified based on perceived probability of seismic activity and exposure of men and equipment to rock burst hazards. High risks areas were targeted for dynamic support installation and comprehensive post-blast monitoring using the mine micro-seismic system and strategically located borehole extensometers. An overview the numerical model calibration process is presented to demonstrate that, in the absence of extensive instrumentation or micro-seismic data, qualitative model calibration can be an effective tool and a reasonable method in assessing stress damage related risks to mine operations.|","Document Type

Dynamic loading methods promise new modes for stimulating geological resources, as the fracture patterns they produce can be tailored by the shape and nature of the pressure pulse employed. However, selecting the type of load is a difficult task: too slow and the stimulatory effect is reduced; too fast and the resource may be negatively impacted by wellbore damage, fines creation or permeability reduction. Moreover, modeling these systems proves challenging due to the myriad of length and timescales involved, combined with the need to accommodate both the generation of new fractures and propagation of preexisting fracture networks.
GEODYN-L is a massively-parallel multi-material Lagrangian code that includes advanced contact models to simulate nonlinear wave propagation through heavily-jointed rock masses, along with material model libraries specifically developed to capture the dynamic response of geologic media. We present results using GEODYN-L to simulate dynamic stimulation of geologic resources with pre-existing fracture networks and discuss the implications of these results for enhancing fracture networks with dynamic loading techniques.|","Document Type

This paper investigates the effects of inflating a reservoir via carbon sequestration or water flooding on the state of stresses in surrounding ductile formations. A better control is needed on the assessment of stresses in the caprock and how would they change due to the inflation process in order to avoid geomechanical problems such as seal integrity and induced seismicity. An important factor in analyzing the reservoir-caprock interaction is the compression-inflation model used to estimate reservoir behavior. A finite elements model of a simple circular disc is created to study the stress redistribution around an inflating reservoir using the commercial software ABAQUS. The paper analyzes the results using well known methods, namely; the Ellipsoidal Inclusion Approach and the Deformation Analysis in Reservoir Space Approach. The analysis verified the results of the Finite Elements Simulation and gave insight to generic redistribution of stresses around an inflating reservoir. The paper also compared two different compression-inflation models; the Modified Cam Clay Model (MCC) and the MIT-E3 model. The MIT-E3 model utilizes a non-linear elastic inflation model and estimates larger redistribution of stresses around the inflating reservoir.|","Document Type

Underground excavations in jointed rocks may result in various modes of rock block failures. Prediction of mode of failure and volume of unstable rock block are essential in the design of excavations in jointed rocks. One important parameter is the rock joint orientation concerning its mean orientation and the dispersion around the mean orientation. Although Fisher distribution is commonly used to evaluate the mean and dispersion of rock joint orientation, the present study establishes that the more advanced Kent distribution can better evaluate the scatter of rock joint orientation of actual field data. A probabilistic simulation is employed in the present study to conduct stability analysis of tetrahedral rock block based on rock joint mean orientation and dispersion obtained from Kent distribution. The results from probabilistic simulation are compared with the commonly used deterministic approach employing only the mean rock joint orientations. The comparison reveals that deterministic method generally gives a conservative estimation of the largest unstable block volume. However, while only a single failure mode of rock block can be identified from the deterministic analysis, the probabilistic simulation approach shows possibilities of multiple rock block failure modes due to scatter of rock joint orientation with the respective probability of occurrence for each mode of block failure.|","Document Type

Underground cavities in rock salt mass for storage of crude oil and natural gas as well as compressed air and hydrogen are essential elements in energy supply management. These cavities are at the same time complex geotechnical constructions, characterized by special excavation procedure using solution mining technique and therefore no direct access for humans is existent. Nevertheless these underground cavities have to fulfil manifold requirements, especially static stability, tightness, third party protection and last but not least environmental safe abandonment after decades of storage operation.
This paper at first gives some basic information about geotechnical characteristics of storage cavities in rock salt mass and the related design concepts guaranteeing long term safe as well as economic efficient storage operation. Essential elements of cavern design are presented such as physical modelling of rock salt behaviour based on laboratory investigations, constitutive models, numerical simulations to site-specifically validate simulation models, to identify prospective load-bearing behaviour as well as to quantify rock mass stresses and deformations related to proposed operation patterns.

The discontinuum-mechanical modeling of salt rocks enables us to take the microstructure of polycrystalline salt rocks into account explicitly within geomechanical simulations. On a micromechanical scale, rock salts constitute a discontinuum of intergrown salt crystals. The macroscopic behavior of this system is determined by the interaction of intra- and intercrystalline properties. Essential processes like softening, fragmentation and pressure-driven percolation along grain boundaries can only be captured and explained physically by considering the microstructure of the material. Constitutive models developed at the IfG, such as the visco-elasto-plastic model for the salt grains themselves and an adhesive frictional shear model for the interaction between the grains, are used to describe the mechanical behavior, while the hydraulic description of fluid percolation is realized using the cubic law for laminar flow. Only after overcoming a percolation threshold the pressure-driven opening and interconnection of flow paths along grain boundaries is initiated in the salt rock and induces a directional percolation in the direction of the maximum principal stress. A consistent parameterization strategy based on macroscopically measured data has been developed, that is able to reproduce the deformation- and failure-behavior of salt rocks qualitatively and quantitatively based on the discontinuum-mechanical approach. The introduced method is successfully used and verified in numerous hydro-mechanical simulations of different boundary conditions, geometries and types of loading.|","Document Type

Four in-situ tests performed in salt caverns in France and Germany are described. The main objective of these tests was to increase our understanding of the long-term behavior of abandoned caverns. It is proven that, in the long term, when cavern brine has reached thermal equilibrium with the rock mass, pressure evolution is governed by cavern creep closure and brine micropermeation through the cavern walls. An equilibrium pressure is reached when the closure rate exactly equals the permeation rate. In the shallow caverns described in this paper, equilibrium pressure is significantly lower than geostatic pressure, ruling out any risk of fracture onset at the cavern roof. Interpretation of these tests allows salt permeability to be back-calculated.|","Document Type

Selection of proper drilling fluid is recognized as a challenging process in high temperature environments. Therefore, chemical and physical properties of drilling mud should be suitable at high temperatures to minimize mud and borehole instabilities. This study is aimed to characterize rheological and filtration properties of sepiolite based muds at high temperatures and to determine their plugging ability in permeable formations. Mud samples were aged up to 204 °C temperature and tested with viscometer and HTHP filter press. The filtration of sepiolite muds were customized through ceramic discs having various pore throat sizes using Permeability Plugging Apparatus (PPA) that simulates more realistic borehole conditions. PPA experiments were conducted at temperatures up to 204 °C and 2070 kPa pressure differential. CaCO3 was used as a lost circulation pill.
Experimental results reveal that customized sepiolite mud is not flocculated up to 204 ° C and yields suitable filtration rates from HTHP filter press. However, the fluid losses obtained from PPA were unacceptable. Therefore, result from HTHP filter press is not a decisive factor to select an effective mud. However, sepiolite muds with CaCO3 can effectively initiate the plugging phenomenon in relatively short time and give low fluid losses and extend the usage of CaCO3 as a loss circulation material.|","Document Type

Crushed salt is being considered as a backfilling material to place around nuclear waste within a salt repository environment. In-depth knowledge of salt thermal and mechanical properties as it reconsolidates is critical to thermal and mechanical modeling of the reconsolidation process.
An experimental study was completed to quantitatively evaluate the thermal conductivity of consolidated crushed salt as a function of porosity. Temperature dependence of this thermal conductivity was also determined. Porosities ranged from 1% to 40%, and temperatures ranged from ambient up to 300°C. This range of conditions is expected to more than cover those that might be encountered in a radioactive waste disposal facility. Two different experimental devices were used to measure these values.
The thermal conductivity of reconsolidated crushed salt decreases with increasing porosity or increasing temperature; conversely, salt thermal conductivity increases as the salt consolidates. Thermal conductivity of experimentally deformed bedded salt cores was shown to be related to fracture density, as a type of porosity. Crushed salt for this study came from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Salt was observed to dewater during heating, and the weight loss from dewatering was quantified.

Rock masses are inherently variable in their nature owing to the complex interrelationship between discontinuities and intact rock. The simplest way to account for this uncertainty is through the explicit modelling of the spatial heterogeneity. This is commonly conducted through stochastic simulation, where multiple realizations of studied attributes are produced. Within this paper a geostatistics-based approach to modelling spatial uncertainty which is new to the field of open pit mine design is presented. The method is based on the use of sequential Gaussian simulation to reproduce the spatial heterogeneity observed in studied attributes. The paper presents the formal methodology used for stochastic simulation and the results obtained from the modelling process. Models were constructed by stochastically varying the geological strength index and uniaxial compressive strength within a geomechanical simulation model of the Ok Tedi mine site in Papua New Guinea.

Enhancing formation permeability through hydraulic fracturing (HF) has become a proven tool for hydrocarbon extraction in shale (i.e., a resource rock formation) as well as geothermal heat extraction from hot, dry rock reservoirs. Permeability in the nanodarcy range is possible in many such unconventional oil and gas reservoirs, thus requiring production to greatly depend on the existence of natural fractures and the additional surface area generated by hydraulic fracturing. Mapping and characterizing the structure of a hydraulic fracture network can be performed using acoustic emission analysis techniques. Many techniques exist to obtain an estimated stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), which is used as a correlation metric for expected well performance. Most of these techniques use the discrete acoustic emission events as boundary points and determine the volume of rock inside the three-dimensional cloud of data that was acquired. While some of these methods for determining rock volumes affected throughout the fracturing process are sophisticated, understanding of the cumulative fracture opening volume from acoustic emission data is not well understood. Laboratory hydraulic fracturing tests were performed while monitoring acoustic emissions continuously. Sample sizes were approximately 15<U+00D7>15<U+00D7>25 cm3. Granite was used as the reservoir material due to the high brittleness, very low permeability, and relative homogeneity. Acoustic emission data recorded throughout the fracturing process was analyzed for three-dimensional event source locations, source mechanisms, orientations and directions of crack movement, and volumetric deformations. A cumulative volumetric deformation was calculated for a specific area near the openhole wellbore where fracture initiation occurred. This volumetric deformation was then compared to micron scale CT scan data for the same region. The fracturing pattern and the geometrical properties of fracturing (e.g., volume, fracture width, etc.) can be measured and analyzed from the 3D CT images. The resolution of the micro-CT images is sufficient to resolve most tiny fractures. By direct observation through micron CT imaging, the acoustic emission data is compared. The consistence of volumetric contributions of these two sets of data is investigated.|","Document Type

The safety assessment of radioactive waste repositories in salt formations requires geomechanical model calculations to analyze the stability of the repository mine and to predict the long-term integrity of the rock salt barrier. Important steps of this analysis are the geological exploration and modeling, the definition of material models and determination of related parameters, the geomechanical and numerical modeling as well as the specification of appropriate criteria to evaluate the numerical results. Two stress-based criteria are considered for rock salt: The dilatancy criterion and the frac criterion. As an example, the geomechanical integrity of the salt barrier in the southern part of the Morsleben repository, Germany, is investigated. Dilatant zones in the rock salt only occur directly around the rooms of the repository; sufficient areas of the salt barrier show no dilatancy even for long time periods.

The bolts provide suspension reinforcement from axial loads and lateral reinforcement from shear resistance effects. The lateral reinforcement provided by a roof bolt is difficult to observe in the field, but is often suggested by observation of roof failure cavities. However, these observations do not indicate whether bolt shear failure precedes or is a result of collapse. This paper highlights the use of a well-calibrated FLAC3D numerical model to investigate the shear resistance provided by a fully grouted bolt. The study first looks at analytical solutions to determine the necessary element size to obtain appropriate deflections of thin beams within FLAC3D. The study then compares different models demonstrating that the shear resistance provided by a fully grouted bolt has a limited impact on the overall stability of the mine roof. The model results indicate that the axial suspension effects of fully grouted bolts are more significant than the lateral reinforcement provided.|","Document Type

We present in this paper two examples on two different scales (in borehole and regional), in which stress magnitudes might be influenced by the presence of fractures and faults. Hydraulic fracturing in situ stress measurements conducted in a borehole showed a large fluctuation of the maximum horizontal principal stress (SHmax) at an order of ~10 MPa over few tens of meter depth. Numerous wide aperture fractures are abundant around depths where S sub>Hmax are relatively low, whereas such fractures are scarce at depths where S sub>Hmax are relatively high. Such wide fractures are oriented optimally for slip under the in situ stress condition, playing a role of limiting stress magnitudes by slippage along the fractures and consequent release of excessive stress. A similar observation was made at a much larger scale. Collected stress data in Gyeongsang Basin, Korea show inhomogeneous horizontal stresses with their magnitudes varying laterally. The lateral variation of horizontal stress magnitudes appears to be related to regional scale fault density. This result also suggests that excessive stress might possibly be released by slippage along faults. This study demonstrates that stress magnitudes can be constrained by natural fractures and faults quite locally (at a scale of few tens of meters) and also quite regionally (over km scales).|","Document Type

Actual problems in geotechnical design, e.g. of underground openings for radioactive waste repositories or high-pressure gas storages, require sophisticated constitutive models and consistent parameters for rock salt that facilitate reliable prognosis of stress-dependent deformation and associated damage from the initial excavation to long times. Fortunately in the long term the response of salt masses is governed by its steady state creep behavior. However, because in experiments the time necessary to reach true steady creep rates can last time periods of some few days to years, depending mainly on temperature, an innovative but simple creep testing approach is suggested. A series of multi-step tests with loading and un-loading cycles allow a more reliable estimate of stationary creep rates in a reasonable time schedule. In completion, the advanced strain-hardening approach of Gunther/Salzer is used which describes all relevant deformation properties of rock salt, e.g. creep and damage induced rock failure, comprehensively within the scope of an unified creep approach. The capability of the combination of improved creep testing procedures and accompanied modelling is demonstrated by recalculating multi-step creep at different loading and temperature conditions. Thus reliable extrapolations relevant to in-situ creep rates (10-9 to 10-13 s-1) become possible.|","Document Type

The challenge of scales posed by geometry of tabular excavations which have great lateral extent relative to mining height is addressed with a dual nodedual mesh finite element technique that allows for whole-mine analysis including surface subsidence and interactions between various sections of the mine at a kilometer scale, effect of joints at an excavation scale, and details of stress concentrations about a longwall panel face at the meter scale. Spatial variability in strata properties and joint set effects are included for greater realism. Examples demonstrate accuracy and reliability of the technique. Application to an underground coal mine in central Utah then illustrates usefulness of the technique for obtaining design guidance. A 10.6 million node, three-dimensional mesh is used for computations that run overnight. Comparisons of measured with calculated surface subsidence including maximum subsidence of 2.4 m (8 ft) and subsidence trough shape confined to areas directly over four major mine sections including 13 sequentially mined longwall panels are in reasonable agreement.|","Document Type

A rock mass is neither a continuous medium nor a totally discrete medium, it is a kind of defect material which contains many cracks, joints and faults. The nonlinear deformation behavior of a rock mass is induced by the propagation and coalescence of cracks and joints under external loads. Therefore, it is of important for rock engineering to analyze the propagation and coalescence process of cracks existed in a rock mass under external loads. The study of crack initiation and propagation is important for the understanding of rock mass behaviour which, in turn, affects rock engineering applications, such as tunnels, foundations and slopes, as well as hydrocarbon and geothermal energy extraction. Cracking mechanisms can be studied experimentally in the laboratory or in the field, or numerically. In the present study, distinct element method (DEM) which is capable to model various discontinuities was employed to simulate crack initiation and propagation in a rock masse specimen containing a single open and closed flaw. Initially, a rock domain containing a closed flaw was considered to model crack propagation. The analysis was performed by sequential modelling. Firstly, a model containing a single closed or open flaw was used to verify the types of propagation shown by Park and Bobet (2009). In these analyses, both open and closed flaws were considered and analysed with different spatial distribution (i.e. flaw angle). After results verification, the effect of open flaw filling material on crack propagation was analysed numerically. This characteristic has not yet been studied in crack propagation studies. The results obtained from open and closed flaws were in good agreement with experimental ones. All cracks mentioned in experimental literatures such as wing (tensile) cracks, coplanar secondary (shear) cracks and oblique secondary cracks were modelled successfully using DEM which indicates method capability to model nonlinear behaviour of rock masses subjected to external loadings. The emphasize of the study is to investigate the effects of open flaws containing filling material on crack initiation and propagation. Weak material was modelled as filling material. The results showed that when flaw is filled with weak materials (as it encountered frequently in natural rock masses) the cracking pattern is quite different with open flaws. In these occasions, the crack propagation direction is different. This phenomenon could be described in terms of stress attenuation in weak filling material, as stress concentration in filling materials causes change in crack propagation directions as well as crack length.|","Document Type

During horizontal well stimulation from an array multiple perforations it is difficult to ensure simultaneous growth of all hydraulic fractures (HF) in the array due to a phenomenon known as stress shadowing, which favors the growth of the less constrained outer fractures in the array. Recently, using a fully coupled, parallel-planar 3D HF model it has been shown that it is possible to alleviate the localization effect of stress shadowing by appropriately breaking the symmetry of the perforation array. This procedure was termed interference fracturing due to the way in which the nearest neighbors to the outer fractures are positioned to interrupt the localization and runaway growth of the outer fractures. In this paper we will explore the robustness of the positioning of the interference fractures on a configuration designed to expose the changes to the dynamics of this complex fully-coupled system affected by perturbations to the initiation points in the array.|","Document Type

Modeling of the interaction between the bits cutters and rock is crucial in the rate of penetration (ROP) drilling simulators which simulate the bits performance under different conditions. This paper first analyzes the mechanism of rock failure by roller cone bits inserts and PDC cutters. Next, the drill bit performance software based on the interaction mechanism is introduced. Applying the software, series of simulation tests on the rock breaking process by the tricone inserts and the PDC cutters have been carried out. The entire process of an insert and PDC cutter interacting with rock, from initial contact to leaving the bottom rock, is simulated. The results show that the software can simulate the interaction between drill bit cutters and rock very well. The contact area on each insert is plotted, from which we can see which part of the insert is more easily worn out. This will help the bit design engineers improve insert shape designs. The simulated loads on the cutters are analyzed and compared. The software can also predict ROP, which can be used to optimize and improve drilling efficiency.|","Document Type

The laboratory testing described here can be seen as the first step in investigating potential thermal effects leading to the creation of a leakage pathway at or in the vicinity of a CO2 injection well. The occurrence of thermal stresses in metal casing, cement and formation can lead to either one or more of these materials developing cracks, or debonding between pairs of materials at their interface. A first investigation is thus concentrating on the rock immediately above the injection reservoir; this sealing rock is most often some variant of shale formation. Here we look at the required temperature contrast between the injected CO2 (or for that matter any other liquid) and the shale formation, in order to initiate tensile fracturing due to the development of tensile stresses exceeding the rock's tensile strength. Finite element simulations suggest that significant fracturing may occur for a temperature contrast of 80° C. An accompanying series of laboratory tests showed that for the chosen shale specimen, fracturing should only be of concern for much higher temperature contrasts.|","Document Type

In room and pillar mines, many intersections of entries are created, resulting in enlarged roof spans and modified stress distributions. A review of roof fall statistics (2002-2011) shows that the roof over an intersection is about twice as likely to fail as over an entry. Numerical models are used to study the stability of the bedded roof strata in coal mines. Thinly laminated roof beds are first studied as a single thin slab under gravity loading. Fully three-dimensional models are created to evaluate stress redistribution and failure development around intersections. It is shown that under the relatively high horizontal stress environment encountered in coal mines, intersections are less stable than entries, in spite of reduced stress over the intersections. The strategy to rotate the direction of development so that entries favorably intersect the major horizontal stress is shown to provide little benefit to intersection stability. A case study is evaluated in which rotation of the mine layout did not improve intersection stability, and the modeling results demonstrated that failure across the diagonals of the rotated intersection produced increased damage when compared to the entries. The numerical models show further that delamination of bedded strata can occur to much greater heights above intersections than entries, which may further contribute to intersection instability.|","Document Type

Shales are among the most considered geomaterials in current energy-related geomechanical investigations; they are involved in engineering applications such as the unconventional extraction of natural gas, CO2 sequestration and nuclear waste geological storage. A deep understanding of their behaviour with regard to variations in the degree of saturation is of primary significance for such applications. This paper illustrates the advances in the experimental analysis of the water retention behaviour of shales under non-isochoric conditions which have been recently achieved by the authors. The testing methodologies involve the direct control of the water content and the subsequent measurement of the total suction at equilibrium by a psychrometer. Furthermore, the volume change response of the material upon total suction variations can be investigated: a fluid displacement technique with a non-polar liquid is used in order to assess the volume changes of the shale samples and to compute the degree of saturation. The results highlight the important features of the retention behaviour of shales, such as the existence of main wetting and drying paths, the hysteresis domain and the scanning behaviour. Selected results are presented for three shales from the northern region of Switzerland.|","Document Type

The mechanics of fluid-driven fracture propagation through fracture networks is of central interest in gas and oil extraction procedures. A number of computational strategies have now been developed to simulate these processes although specific understanding of the propagation mechanics in the vicinity of pre-existing discontinuities or faults is still limited. This paper investigates the problem of formulating appropriate fluid branching logic at multiple flow path junctions and the influence of sudden contractions or expansions in the flow path channel width at discontinuity intersections. A plane strain model is assumed. A question of additional interest is the possible existence of a fluid lag region between the flow front and the mobilized fracture front.

Design, analysis and performance assessment of potential salt repositories for heat-generating nuclear waste require knowledge of thermal, mechanical, and fluid transport properties of reconsolidating granular salt. To inform salt repository evaluations, we have undertaken an experimental program to determine Bulk and Youngs moduli and Poissons ratio of reconsolidated granular salt as a function of porosity and temperature and to establish the deformational processes by which the salt reconsolidates. Tests were conducted at 100, 175, and 250°C. In hydrostatic tests, confining pressure is increased to 20 MPa with periodic unload/reload loops to determine K. Volume strain increases with increasing temperature. In shear tests at 2.5 and 5 MPa confining pressure, after confining pressure is applied, the crushed salt is subjected to a differential stress, with periodic unload/reload loops to determine E and ?. At predetermined differential stress levels the stress is held constant and the salt consolidates. Displacement gages mounted on the samples show little lateral deformation until the samples reach a porosity of ~ 10%. Interestingly, vapor is vented only for 250°C tests and condenses at the vent port. It is hypothesized the brine originates from fluid inclusions, which were made accessible by heating and intragranular deformational processes including decrepitation.|","Document Type

A rock bolt represents the most important element in ensuring stability of rock mass excavations. This paper presents weaknesses and strengths of methods which deal with evaluation of rock bolts. Most widely used is pull-out test, conducted for capacity determination in destructive manner. To overcome destructivity, a method of acoustic emission shows that the force close to the failure point can be determined, so that the rock bolt will remain usable for strengthening purposes. Another NDT system, called GRANIT, is developed in order to determine load level inside rock bolt by analyzing its natural frequencies. When it comes to evaluation of grouting quality, efforts were made in order to find reliable solution, but existing methods still have weaknesses which limit their applicability. First developed and today still widely used is Boltometer which is based on emission of energy in rock bolt and on analyzing returned energy. However, dissipation of energy, due to karstic phenomena may not yield good results. Some efforts in improvement of weaknesses of Boltometer have been conducted and are presented in paper. A basic concept is given for novel method for NDT evaluation of grouting quality, which is in development at Faculty of Civil Engineering in Zagreb.|","Document Type

Transition of a failure mechanism from extensional to shear dominated failure with increasing confinement is widely observed in the rupture of samples in the laboratory and in situ associated with underground excavation in brittle failing rocks. However, common failure criteria such as the Hoek-Brown criterion are not able to capture or explain the change in failure mechanism. Hence, a better understanding of these confinement-dependent failure processes is key in continuing safe underground excavation in brittle failing rocks. The 3D finite difference code, FLAC3D, was adopted to investigate the behavior of underground excavation on a numerical model in terms of failure mode transition associated with the confinement level. It is hypothesized that extensional failure is dominant at low confinement, but shear failure mainly occurs at higher confinement. The Hoek-Brown constitutive model embedded in FLAC3D has been modified in order to simulate extensional failure associated with spalling at lower confinement by mean of ubiquitous joints installation. The results support the observation that the rock strength and its behavior may differ significantly in the direct vicinity of openings where the spalling mainly occurs.|","Document Type

According to the technical guide for grouting method for dam construction in Japan modified in the year 2003, one of the key issues for grouting is quality assurance and effectiveness by minimizing the amount of injected grout.

This contribution will examine the design and capabilities of a new measuring system, specifically a high-pressure vessel, which not only enables ultrasonic sounding of rock samples by means of longitudinal P waves, but also by two perpendicularly polarized shear waves on spherical samples under hydrostatic pressures up to 100 MPa. The advantage of our approach is that it allows for the simultaneous measurement of P, S1 and S2 wave velocity propagation in 132 independent directions throughout the entire sphere (except the sphere poles). This new system was designed and constructed to enable the use of movable shear wave transducers (transmitter/receiver) in oil under confining stress. The same high-pressure measuring system enables the measurement of sample deformation in the points of P-wave ultrasonic sounding up to 400 MPa, what enables that mutual dependence between static and dynamic rock parameters to be studied. Data obtained will enable the calculation of many important seismic parameters like elastic anisotropy, crack presence and orientation, crack density tensor, their directional changes and closure under pressure, elastic wave attenuation and finally, full elastic stiffness tensor at different values of hydrostatic pressure. A laboratory approach based on this new high-pressure system enables the study of rock dynamic and static bulk moduli under different values of hydrostatic pressure.|","Document Type

Roughness at varying scales is an important component of the shear strength of discontinuities. Small scale roughness can be assessed in drillcore and through laboratory testing of drillcore derived samples. Large scale roughness, or waviness, also plays an important part in peak shear strength and a number of methods for its incorporation into defect plane strength models are presented. 
A number of methods for capturing waviness data from exposed faces are reviewed. A method is presented for deriving waviness from downhole televiewer data, which is shown to be significantly more accurate than structural data derived from core logging. The method is based on work undertaken in the highly anisotropic bedded units of the Hamersley Province, Western Australia where televiewer surveys are routinely undertaken. Values of waviness are derived through a review of variation in dip resolved in the direction of the slope face. This method allows design engineers to incorporate large scale roughness in defect plane shear strengths at the design stage.|","Document Type

This paper presents a case study of the effect of an abandoned cavern of large diameter on the long-term stability of an oil storage facility in domal salt. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve stores crude oil in solution-mined caverns in the Bryan Mound salt dome, located near Freeport, Texas. An additional 400-m diameter cavern, Cavern 3, was constructed for brine production and storage in the 1940s and plugged and abandoned in 1980. Surface subsidence measurements show an unexpectedly larger subsidence rate over Cavern 3 than the rest of the site, possibly indicating that this cavern may be losing pressure, which would affect boreholes for nearby storage caverns. This paper evaluates the current status of Cavern 3 using subsidence data from site-wide surveys and GPS and tiltmeters installed over the cavern, and large-scale computational analyses including realistic cavern geometries and the effects of heterogeneous salt creep properties. Next, it describes a surface subsidence evaluation plan to analyze current surface subsidence data, in addition to possibly obtaining other available information such as InSAR data, to monitor future subsidence on a continuous basis. Finally, the paper will use the case study to discuss the formation of a strategy for abandoning decommissioned caverns in a long-term storage facility built in domal salt.|","Document Type

The Fracture Gradient (FG) can differ significantly from the least principal stress (i.e., Shmin), estimated as fracture closure pressure from extended leak-off tests (xLOTs) and micro- or mini-frac tests. FG may instead be derived from fracture initiation pressure (FIP), or from the pressure required for the fluid to leak off through conductive natural fractures. In this study, we present data from a deep-water gas field in Australia. We modeled Shmin from leak-off tests (LOT), extended (X)LOT, minifrac, and injectivity tests in 12 offset wells using both log-based poro-elastic and effective stress ratio models. We constrained the remaining components of the stress tensor using a range of field data. The Geomechanical model was verified using field observations of borehole breakouts. We calculated the FIP and its variation with borehole trajectory. This method showed that FIP could be smaller than Shmin for certain well trajectories. In those cases, when equivalent circulating density (ECD) is higher than FIP but smaller than Shmin, near-wellbore induced fractures could cause partial losses. When FIP <U+2265> Shmin, if ECD exceeds FIP or fracture linkup pressures, total loss would occur, causing the risk of lost circulation to elevate. We additionally used the Mohr-Coulomb sliding criterion to identify the population of fractures in the reservoir most susceptible to shear failure. The results indicated that fractures with dips of 50-70° that strike approximately NE-SW may become critically stressed with slightly overbalanced wellbore pressure during drilling and therefore may develop into pathways for fluid loss. The results of this study led to revisions of the planned well trajectories because of the risk of fluid losses into critically stressed natural fractures, as well as the variation of the FIP relative to Shmin with respect to wellbore trajectory.|","Document Type

A repository for heat-generating nuclear waste provides an engineering challenge far beyond general experience. Long-term evolution of repository performance is precluded from direct observation or measurement. Therefore, analogues and long-term predictions are necessary to establish enduring safety functions. Accurate prediction of salt repository response is enhanced by a thorough understanding of the mechanistic processes and application of valid models. In the instance of a salt formation providing the host medium, the scientific community has made great strides toward formulating and using models that capture observed physical phenomena in computational mechanics applications. For example, strain rates are often cast as functions of stress difference and temperature because salt deformation under repository conditions has been shown to be very sensitive to these parameters. Micromechanics help define appropriate relationships by virtue of a deformation mechanism map approach. Incorporation of micromechanics helps explain history effects, normal transient response, inverse transients, and dependence of creep rate on stress difference and temperature, which are a direct consequence of existing and evolving substructures.
If one understands the physical processes then predictions can be made with greater confidence. A viable constitutive model should therefore provide a reasonable approximation of laboratory results and reflect the physical processes that account for deformation. Laboratory studies facilitate measurement of generic mechanical, thermal, hydrological, and chemical salt properties in a controlled environment. A large body of laboratory data has been generated on salt deformation, which describes phenomenology of salt across a range of temperatures expected in a heat-generating waste disposal system. Microstructural studies described here can be used to develop and interpret input parameters for models that predict material behavior. This overview emphasizes empirical evidence of isochoric deformation processes in salt and supports engineering and long-term performance evaluation of repositories for heat-generating nuclear waste.|","Document Type

Ability to induce complex, highly connected fracture networks, that can remain open during production, is the key to unlock permeability challenged shale gas plays. Within the time and pressure scale of hydraulic fracturing operations, it is difficult to create fracture complexity in ductile shales. However, when subjected to a high rate/pulse loading, rock might exhibit a brittle to ductile transition and a complex fracture network might be created. Along these lines, the concept of pulsed fracturing, that customizes the pressure-time behavior of a pulse source to create multiple fractures, is introduced. In this paper, an integrated 3D model that quantifies fracture initiation, growth, and coalescence due to initial and post-peak pulse loading is presented. The simulation involves a numerical algorithm that couples tensile/shear/compactive failure algorithms with dynamic fracture propagation and pore fluid pressure. Geomechanical modeling approach makes it possible to optimize pulsed fracturing for different shale plays. After constitutive model description and presentation of key aspects of the model, the model is employed to a reservoir dataset to evaluate pulsed fracturing as an alternative fracturing technique. The results show that, if designed accurately, pulsed fracturing could help trigger a ductile to brittle transition and can generate complex fracture networks.|","Document Type

However, field observations and microseismic (MS) activity suggest that, natural fractures can reactivate upon stimulation: forming complex/sheared discrete fracture networks (DFNs). Current industry practice primarily utilizes MS events alone to determine the extent of reactivation within a DFN and consequently the stimulated rock volume (SRV). However, MS activity does not necessarily distinguish between dry (i.e. reactivation with non-conductive fractures) vs. wet events (i.e. reactivation with conductive fractures). Indeed, wet events are most likely to contribute towards a Productive-SRV as these conductive fractures have an increased chance to remain open during production. This paper presents a series of geomechanical sensitivity analysis that quantify the difference between fracture events within the framework of a complex discrete fracture network simulator coupled with fluid flow and fracture reactivation. Our results show that the extent of Productive-SRV is controlled primarily by a combination of reservoir, geomechanical and stimulation parameters. These parameters include: DFN geometry (e.g. patterns, spacing, density, and orientation), stress anisotropy/isotropy, frictional strength, the duration of stimulation, and the number of stages. Results are further coupled with an unconventional reservoir simulator to quantify ultimate recovery/production for different scenarios.

This paper focused on the modification of numerical models for elastic wave propagation and attenuation. The new models were composed of a piston, a shank rod, a rod and a joint. The acoustic impedance of the piston, shank rod and rod was set to the same values as actual products. A spring model for the joint was adopted in the calculation. The calculated waves were compared to the measured ones which did not have simple shape but had many small oscillations due to the complex shape of the piston and shank rod. To reproduce the oscillations, not only the acoustic impedance of the models but also the spring constants at the joint and collision needed to be appropriate values.|","Document Type

In recent years, the development of oil and gas from shale has proceeded quickly in the world due to the application of multi-stage fracturing technology in horizontal wells. It is imperative to study the poroelastic characteristics of the rock for modeling the performance of rock under in-situ conditions, thus ensuring the success of hydraulic fracturing. Biot's coefficient is one of the key poroelastic parameters for calculating the effective stress for creating artificial fractures in the shale formations. In this study, we propose anew method to measure the Biot's coefficient. Our method simplified the measuring procedures to obtain the Biot's coefficient by controlling the confining pressure, which isused to maintain the volume of the sample, while altering the pore pressure. Shales amples recovered form Bakken formation in Willistion Basin is tested using this method. The results of our experiments show that the Biot's coefficient of Bakken samples obtained from horizontal drilling and vertical drilling are significantly different from each other. This significant difference of Biot's coefficient with different drilling-direction provides scientists and engineers a solid base for in-situ stress analysis during multi stage hydraulic fracturing and reservoir depletion due to production.|","Document Type

Permeability evolution in intact rock as a result of micro-crack propagation is fundamental in understanding fluid flow within the excavation damage zone (EDZ) around underground openings. A 2D grain-based discrete element method incorporating Voronoi joint model is used to simulate the permeability evolution with progressive damage in intact rock when it is subjected to incremental mechanical loading. The rock response during uniaxial and triaxial loadings is simulated with and without taking into account the hydro-mechanical interactions between fluid and solid part of the rock. The numerical experiment results show that when modeling the rock behavior under compression, ignoring the coupled damage-flow processes results in an inaccurate prediction of mechanical properties of rock such as the peak strength and the post-peak response. The stress-strain response of the sample indicates that an increase in the applied confining stresses increases both the strain hardening range and the peak strength. In addition, the Permeability of models during triaxial loading increases by up to 2.5 orders of magnitude prior to rupture of rock. Progressive development of fractures as a result of crack accumulation leads to over 3 orders of magnitude increase in post-failure permeability compared to the permeability at the peak stress. These changes have been reported from laboratory testing results as well as in-situ permeability measurements carried out in the damaged zones in tunnel boundary. It has been demonstrated that Voronoi joint model incorporated in a DEM-based code has capability to simulate stress-induced permeability change in the brittle rocks as a result of processes such as initiation, propagation, and accumulation of cracks.|","Document Type

Asymmetric fracture growth with respect to the borehole when not accounted for in the design of the hydraulic fractures can result in a section of rock mass being not effectively stimulated or preconditioned, depending on the purpose of the fracture treatment. The ability to predict asymmetric growth in hydraulic fracturing is therefore important. This paper focuses on a method to infer the existence of asymmetric fracture geometry from tiltmeter measurements. The forward model used in the analysis is based on the displacement discontinuity method and the Bayesian inversion procedure is employed [1]. The forward model is developed from the analytical expression for computing the displacements and tilts due to a point source in an elastic half-space developed by Okada [2]. The displacements and tilts due to a given fracture geometry are then obtained by numerical integration of this solution, by considering the point sources to be located at the quadrature points. To validate the method, mapping of asymmetric fractures having polygon and elliptical geometries is carried out using synthetic data sets. Finally, the effect of the fracture asymmetry on the inverted results is also analysed. Real data from a field site [3] where asymmetry was measured from intersections of the hydraulic fracture with offset boreholes has been analysed. Preliminary results show that the procedure is able to satisfactorily predict fracture asymmetry from measured data when the fracture is relatively close to the tiltmeter array.|","Document Type

We compare an evolutionary to a static approach for modeling stress and deformation around a salt dome and we show that the two approaches predict different stress histories and very different strains within the adjacent wall rocks. Significantly higher shear stresses develop during the evolutionary analysis near the base of a rising salt dome. In addition, the static approach is not able to capture the decrease in the minimum principal stress caused by the circumferential dome expansion. Strains predicted by the evolutionary model are an order of magnitude higher than those predicted by the static model, and they show significant shearing in the horizontal plane. The evolutionary approach is performed using Elfen, and the static using Abaqus. Overall, our results highlight that forward evolutionary modeling can capture the stress history of mudrocks close to salt domes, which can improve significantly predictions for material properties (porosity, anisotropy in velocities measurements), as well as pore pressures and shear/tensile strength.|","Document Type

The slope design criteria(2011) of Republic of Korea have been revised to consider infiltration analysis with precipitation intensity and duration.

Infiltration characteristics (infiltration module) and safety factor (slope module) changes of a cut-slope are analyzed under various conditions of precipitation intensity and duration, using the Soilworks program.

Impregnated diamond (ID) bits are rotary drag bits, which are specifically dedicated to drill hard and abrasive rock formations. Performing like a grinder wheel, the cutting face ID bits is continuously evolving during drilling, exposing new and sharp diamonds. The performance and the life of these bits are thus controlled by an integrated and complex wear process. To better understand the wear mechanisms of ID bits, a series of drilling and cutting tests were conducted with ID core bits and segments at CSIROs Drilling Mechanics Laboratory. The results have indicated that the evolution of ID cutting face is characterized by different patterns or wear mechanisms, depending on the depth of cut imposed. At shallow depth of cuts, the wear is predominantly dominated by diamond polishing and erosion of the binder, and at higher depth of cuts, the wear is controlled by diamond fracturing and matrix abrasion.|","Document Type

Discontinuities have a significant effect on the mechanical behavior of the rock mass and understanding the mechanical behavior of discontinuities is essential for reliable design of any structure inside or on the rock mass. Predominant joint models have been developed under constant normal loading condition. However, it is widely accepted that the shear strength of rock joints is controlled by the inherent stiffness of the rock. In this paper, experimental study of the shear behavior of joint under constant normal load (CNL) and constant normal stiffness (CNS) were undertaken. Synthetic joint profiles with single and multiple asperities with base angles 20 and 30 degrees were prepared and direct shear tests under CNL and CNS with different initial normal stresses were carried out. Results of this study showed that the experiments conducted under CNS led to higher shear strength values and lower normal displacements compared to the experiments conducted under CNL condition. A comparison between the results of the experimental tests and conventional shear strength models was undertaken. Results of CNL experiments on multiple asperities were in good agreement with Ladanyi and Archambault model. However, for CNS tests only when the shearing mechanism is sliding, there is a good agreement between the experiments and the Patton sliding model.|","Document Type

The evolution of the long-term mechanical, hydraulic, and transport characteristics of rock fractures must be predicted in advance by considering the issue of the underground deposits of the energy by products of high-level radioactive waste. This research presents slide-hold-slide direct shear experiments conducted for halite (rock salt) specimens with single fractures so as to investigate the effects of load holding on the mechanical properties of rock joints. From the experimental results, it is confirmed that the shear stress reduction can be observed during load holding. It is also confirmed that the shear strength recovery can be observed after load holding and it is found to increase with the increment of load holding period. In this research, the shear strength recoveries are plotted with the holding period. It is confirmed that the shear stress recovery depends on the log t healing law. This is because the dominant factor in the shear strength recovery during holding may be attributed to a purely mechanical process, like creep deformation at the contacting asperities.|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing technique has been widely applied in the enhanced geothermal systems, to increase injection rates for geologic sequestration of CO2, and most importantly for the stimulations of oil and gas reservoirs, especially the unconventional shale reservoirs. One of the key points for the success of hydraulic fracturing operations is to accurately estimate the redistribution of pore pressure and stresses around the induced fracture and predict the reactivations of pre-existing faults. The fracture extension as well as pore pressure and stress regime around it are affected by: poro- and thermoelastic phenomena as well as by fracture opening under the combined action of applied pressure and in-situ stress. A couple of numerical studies have been done for the on this for the purpose of analyzing the potential for fault reactivation resulting from pressurization of the hydraulic fracture. In this work, a comprehensive analytical model is constructed to estimate the stress and pore pressure distribution around an injection induced fracture from a single well in an infinite reservoir. The model allows the leak-off distribution in the formation to be three-dimensional with the pressure transient moving ellipsoidcally outward into the reservoir with respect to the fracture surface. The pore pressure and the stress changes in three dimensions at any point around the fracture caused by thermo- and poroelasticity and fracture compression are investigated. Then, the problem of constant water injection into a hydraulic fracture in Barnett shale is presented. In particular, with Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, we calculate the fault reactivation potential around the fracture. This study is of interest in interpretation of micro-seismicity in hydraulic fracturing and in assessing permeability variation around a stimulation zone, as well as in estimation of the fracture spacing during hydraulic fracturing operations.|","Document Type

The Numerical Manifold Method (NMM) with a two-cover-meshing system is an ideal method to handle boundaries, considering its flexibility with no need to adjust mathematical nodes onto boundaries, the meshing efficiency and its integration precision. In this study, we derived different forms of Lagrange multiplier methods (LMMs) and jump function methods (JFMs) for boundary constraints in the frame of NMM. These approaches for boundary constraints make full use of the aforementioned advantages of NMM and are established based on a clear physical meaning of water flow by an energy-work seepage model. The LMM approaches are discontinuous approaches in which Lagrange Multipliers provide links between discontinuous physical covers cut by material interfaces, whereas the JFM approaches are continuous, in which the discontinuities of material interfaces are realized by introducing jump terms across a continuous medium. The boundary constraint approaches developed in this study were coded into an NMM water flow model. We compared simulation results involving Dirichlet boundary conditions and idealized faulted rock using LMM and JFM with analytical solutions, and prove that both methods provide accurate results, with additional degrees of freedom introduced (or eliminated by special physical meaning). Based on these results, we recommend the LMM considering its accuracy and efficiency, flexibility, especially when involving intense geometric change or fracture intersections. Last, we apply and demonstrate the LMM approach in a simplified model of flow through porous rock with a major fault and a tunnel and arrived at convincing results.|","Document Type

With recent developments in numerical codes, it is now possible to investigate the relation between kinematics and the damage required for the failure of rock slopes. This paper investigates the influence of kinematics and failure surface geometry on damage leading to the failure of rock slopes using a three-dimensional lattice spring code. Two new methods are introduced to quantify damage in the numerical simulations. In the first method, damage is quantified using damage intensity parameters, D21 and D32. In this method damage is defined as the ratio of total length/area of the newly created cracks within the model to the sampling area/volume. In the second method an ellipsoid of damage is defined to encompass newly created cracks within a given model. Geometrical characteristics of the ellipsoid including volume, length and orientation of its axes allow quantification of damage within the model. The numerical simulation results highlight the close connection between kinematics and damage in high rock slopes.|","Document Type

Rock slopes adjacent to linear infrastructure pose potential hazards to traffic and inspection personnel; remote sensing data can minimize the hazards posed and can provide more detail on rock slopes. Remote sensing data from terrestrial photogrammetric or lidar data collection from a recent rockfall zone site are presented and compared and analyzed. The comparisons made include comments on data collection procedures, processing, and processing results; including data filtering, meshing techniques implemented in various software programs, point density comparison and a surface difference comparison. The point density is found to be significantly higher in the lidar data from this site, though the distance between the two surfaces from a mesh-to-mesh comparison was under ±0.05 m for 97.7% of the model; making both models precise with respect to each other. A discontinuity mapping analysis was also conducted and similar results were found between filtered and smoothed photogrammetric and lidar datasets, however the lidar dataset was able to detect more joints; which was anticipated by the authors.|","Document Type

We conducted experiments in which a high concentration (50% v/v) of granular solids suspended in a non-Newtonian carrier fluid (0.75% guar gum in water) flowed through a parallel-plate fracture. Digital imaging and particle-imagevelocimetry analysis provided a detailed map of velocities within the fracture. Results demonstrate development of a strongly heterogeneous velocity field within the fracture. We observed the highest velocities along the no-flow boundaries of the fracture and the lowest velocities along the centerline of the fracture. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using a recently developed model of the rheology of dense suspensions of mono-disperse solids in Newtonian carrier fluids closely reproduced experimental observations of pressure gradient versus flow rate. Results from additional simulations suggest that small (3%) variations in solid volume fraction within the fracture could lead to significant (factor of two) velocity variations within the fracture with negligible changes in observed pressure gradients. The variations in solid volume fraction persist over the length of the fracture, suggesting that such heterogeneities may play a significant role in the transport of dense suspensions. Our work suggests that a simple average conductivity parameter does not adequately represent the flow of high solid content suspensions in a fracture, as the flow develops strong three-dimensional structure even in a uniform rectangular channel.|","Document Type

In naturally fractured shale oil and gas reservoirs, it is expected that the hydraulic fracture behavior is significantly influenced by the interaction with pre-existing natural fractures. However, the relationship between fracture behaviors and natural fractures has not been sufficiently clarified because direct observation of all the fractures or microcracks generated during the field or laboratory scale hydraulic fracturing is difficult. In this paper, a series of flow-coupled DEM simulations varying the properties of natural fracture, such as the permeability of natural fractures and the angle between created hydraulic fracture and natural fracture (approach angle), is presented. As a results, different fracture growth patterns were observed with different combination of approach angle and permeability of natural fracture. When the approach angle is high and the permeability is low, the hydraulic fracture ignores the existence of natural fracture and it propagated straight to the direction of maximum compressive principal stress. On the other hand, when the approach angle is low and the permeability is high, hydraulic fracture propagated along with a natural fracture. After that, it branched or curved to the direction of maximum principal stress.|","Document Type

Rocks with natural fractures, cracks, faults and vugs have complex multi-connected pathways for fluid flow. In these systems, fluid flow, especially to production wellbores, can change as reservoir conditions change as fluids are injected to the reservoir. In typical practice, the more detailed the characterization of the fracture network, the easier it is to optimize recovery process design and well placement to maximize the recovery factor of petroleum fluids. Furthermore, for tight rocks where hydraulic fracturing is required to enable sufficient fluid mobility for economic production, it is critical to understand the placement of the induced fractures, their connectivity, extent, and interaction with natural fractures within the system. Stress anisotropy and interactions between new fractures and natural fractures in the formation can dictate the mode, orientation and size of the hydraulic fracture network. In this study, normal deformation is coupled with fluid flow to evaluate the effect of the stress anisotropy on fracture network propagation in rock. The results demonstrate that stress anisotropy and existing natural fractures networks are playing critical roles in creating fracture-network complexity and connectivity. The model developed here assumes that the flow is single-phase and isothermal, matrix permeability is zero, and that deformation arises from small normal displacement in an infinite, homogeneous, linearly elastic medium. Specifically, the model couples fluid flow and stresses induced by fracture deformation in a plane. For this purpose, a system of equations governing fracture deformation and fluid flow through a complex fracture network is solved. The results illustrate the importance of rock properties, stress magnitude, and stress orientation on fracture complexity in unconventional naturally fractured reservoirs.|","Document Type

A constitutive model that couples elastic-plastic and damage theories is developed to predict the mechanical behavior of a shale from the Mont Terri rock laboratory (Opalinus Clay). The framework of continuum damage mechanics allows to predict the degradation of the elastic parameters with strains, while the coupling with plasticity correctly reproduces the irreversible strains typical of hard clayey materials. The yield surfaces (one for damage and one for plasticity) are postulated and the evolution equations of the internal variables are derived throughout the application of normality rule. Thermodynamic consistency of the model is investigated. The plastic behavior is described with a non-linear strain hardening function and is coupled with an isotropic damage model suitable for brittle and quasi-brittle geomaterials. The model is integrated with an implicit scheme that guarantees convergence and accuracy.

We report a field study on solution mining of magnesium chloride from bischofite layers in the Netherlands at depths between 1500 and 1850 m. Subsidence that was observed in the area is due to part of the brine production being realized by cavern squeeze; some of which were connected. We used an earlier developed inversion scheme to quantify the distribution of the squeeze volumes from the subsidence measurements. We incorporated in it the creep behavior of the rock salt as a convolution between the time-dependent response of a squeeze event and the actual production history. With a Maxwell viscoelastic behavior in the salt with realistic time constant, we achieved a good result for the subsidence values and for the observed ratio between subsidence bowl volume and squeeze volume. With the new understanding we created physics-based forecasts for different production scenarios and provided an estimate for the remaining time and the producible volumes before the maximum allowed amount of subsidence is reached. After completely stopping production, our model predicted a rebound of the subsidence.|","Document Type

Excavation of a large pit is performed in stages, which subjects the rock mass to several changes in stress conditions during the life of the mine.

Preliminary results are presented on the use of discrete element method (DEM) numerical models as a possibility to simulate rock mass damage under stress relaxation. Numerical testing of SRM samples under specific stress paths may be an alternative to characterizing relaxation induced damage and its effect on rock mass strength. Preliminary results presented in this paper show the development of damage during the process of unloading.|","Document Type

Drilling with drag bits (PDC bits) simultaneously involves fragmentation of rock by the cutters and frictional contact on the cutter wear flats. While there is reasonable understanding of the forces arising from the cutting process, knowledge of the factors affecting the contact forces on the wear flats is still fragmentary. This paper focuses on determining the parameters that influence the mean normal stress <U+03C3> on the cutter wear flats, and on mapping the dependence of <U+03C3> on these parameters, by analyzing the idealized problem of a slightly inclined rigid slider moving on the surface of a Mohr-Coulomb elastoplastic half-plane.|","Document Type

To evaluate the equivalent permeability of fractured crystalline rocks, the stochastic discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling approach is widely used. In this paper, a series of numerical simulations were conducted by establishing stochastic discrete fracture networks (DFNs), based on the Monte-Carlo method. Then, the existence of representative element volume (REV) and the possibility of penetration principal value of fractured rock masses were estimated with varying orientations of fractures and varying DFN model size under two kinds of boundary conditions. The numerical simulation results show that when the side length of DFN model is larger than 40m, the equivalent permeability of both kx and ky become stable, indicating that a DFN model size of 40m can be approximated as a REV for practical applications. Whats more, based on the permeability coefficients calculated above, penetration ellipses were fitted using the least square method. According to the figures of percolation ellipses, main percolation directions were determined directly to describe the directivities of rock fracture equivalent permeability.|","Document Type

In complex reservoirs with geological discontinuities such as faults, the risks of seal breach increased by injection and depletion. One of the phenomena which can cause serious production losses and environmental accidents is the reactivation of geological faults. This occurs in association with variations in stresses induced in the formation, which can be high enough to reactivate the faults and significantly modify reservoir behavior. In such cases, fluid can migrate to shallow depths compromising the integrity of the entire fault plane and generating one of the most critical situations in the oil industry. This work investigates through the finite element method the phenomenon of reactivation of geological faults. Four numerical formulations are used for this purpose: (1) explicit representation of the fault with interface elements, (2) continuum model with fault strength criterion applied to stresses on the fault plane, (3) equivalent anisotropic continuum with a fault guidance plane and (4) equivalent continuum with yield criterion using equivalent homogeneous properties for the reservoir-fault system. These methods are applied to a synthetic two-dimensional finite element model comprising a normal fault. Comparative results are shown.|","Document Type

Block size estimation is required to optimize support design, to estimate volumes for rockfall catchment systems, and is an integral part of many rockmass classification systems. The most common problem with existing methods used to determine block size is that a single, representative average block is calculated. By using the average intensity and average fracture size in analyses, the possibility for large blocks to form is disregarded. Equally important may be the presence of zones comprised of very small blocks that cannot be supported in the same way that the average sized block would be. To attempt to incorporate the distributions of fracture sizes and intensities encountered in a rockmass, DFNs have been used to create block size distributions for a given set of parameters. This work compares existing estimators of block size to outputs from DFN modeling. A set of descriptive parameters are presented for block size distribution curves. Charts to estimate block size distributions for different geometries are presented.|","Document Type

The crack damage progression in crystalline rocks is approximated in laboratory by means of rigorous strain measurement and/or monitoring of Acoustic Emission (AE) activity. When both means are used, they are treated independently for quantification of damage in the rock. This paper is investigating a new method to combine the AE and strain data in a unified function to calculate the balance of stored and released energy in the rock due to loading (strain energy) and micro-cracking respectively. This method introduces a new solution for measurement and quantification of crack damage in rock and also provides a tool to investigate the brittleness of different rock types. Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) testing of six different rock types with strain measurement and AE monitoring was performed for this study. The application of the new method to the data collected from the UCS tests indicates the difference between the behaviour of the various rock types in terms of sudden energy release at the onset of CI threshold and the difference in the storability of strain energy before and after CI and CD thresholds.|","Document Type

In 2009, Typhoon Morakot brought heavy rainfall and severely damaged the mountainous area in Taiwan. The Hsien-du-shan rock avalanche occurred at ChiaHsien Township, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan, destroyed the Hsiaolin Village and killed more than 400 local residents. The case highlighted the great importance to identify the location and precursors of a possible rock avalanche. In this study, the initiation of the Hsien-du-shan rock avalanche is simulated by a discrete numerical analysis method, called Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA). The simulation indicates that two slope failures occurred at the Hsien-du-shan rock avalanche due to the geometry of the sliding surface. The sliding rocks and soils can be briefly divided into two groups. The computational results fit well to the local information, which two giant bursts were heart during the slope failure. However, the time interval of the two slope failures in DDA was very short. Therefore, the slope failure can be also considered as a massive one.|","Document Type

Understanding the geometry of a hydraulic fracture is key to predicting its behavior and performance. Physical measurement of field hydraulic fracture geometries beyond the borehole is difficult and typically cost prohibitive with the only published examples being mine-back studies and cores. Laboratory-scale hydraulic fracturing experiments can more accurately measure the fracture geometry due to smaller specimen size and improved monitoring capabilities. This paper presents laboratory work where hydraulic fracture treatments were performed using epoxy injection such that a propagating fracture could be stabilized and preserved at near-critical state. Constant backpressure was applied after hydraulic breakdown but before cessation of fracture extension to maintain near-critical state geometry. Preliminary results are presented giving measurement of fracture dimensions, including aperture, at the millimeter scale for a hydraulic fractured acrylic specimen. The pressure, flow rate, material strains, acoustic emissions, and video stills associated with this fracture are also presented and analyzed. A second experiment fracturing a 300<U+00D7>300<U+00D7>300 mm3 cubic foot granite block using epoxy is also discussed. Data regarding the interaction between shear and tensile dominated fractures is presented and discussed.|","Document Type

A robust understanding of the thermal stress development due to injection of cold fluids is crucial when developing the Asgard field on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) offshore Norway. To get a better and more direct estimation of the stress reduction, a series of triaxial tests under uniaxial strain control were conducted with cooling on reservoir core samples. The purpose of the testing program was to find elastic properties, thermal expansion coefficients and change in confining stress due to temperature reduction. The results show that the cooling related stress effect is strongly stress path dependent. As the sample is subjected to more cooling the stress state tends to approach an elasto-plastic formulation leading to a more soft response of the material. As a consequence the measured stress effect is lower than the estimated which was based on elastic state assumptions.|","Document Type

Characterizing the change of the transport properties during the propagation of macrocracks in a quasi-brittle material (rocks, hard soils,) is one of the challenges of current research on hydraulic fracturing. Analyzing such change of properties is a way to determine the extent of the Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV). The degradation of quasi-brittle materials encompasses micro-crack propagation, interaction and coalescence in order to form a macro-crack. These phenomena are located progressively within the so-called Fracture Process Zone (FPZ). The shape and growth of the FPZ, and its interaction with boundaries, lead to typical phenomena such as size effects, boundary effects and shielding effects. In this paper, we consider synthetic quasi-brittle materials (mortar or concrete) that mimic the mechanical behavior of natural rock, and develop analysis tools based on mesoscale simulations that enable the study of characteristic lengths during damage and failure of such materials.|","Document Type

In this paper, a disposal cell for the high level radioactive wastes (HLW) is studied in order to identify and demonstrate the coupled phenomena evolving in HLW repository. In the disposal cell, the overpack and container, which represent important engineering barriers of disposal cell, may be corroded by the eventual arrival of underground water coming from host rock. The corrosion of metallic components induces a degradation of its useful properties including strength, permeability and volumetric expansions, etc. Based on the concept of disposal cell, different materials (i.e. clay, steel and air) are taken into account in numerical simulation. Their mechanical behaviour are characterised by different constitutive models respectively. In order to overcome the eventual numerical difficulties and quantitatively reproduce the closing process of spaces presented in the disposal cell, numerical methods are formulated to descript the long-term corrosion behaviour of steel and the progressive closure of spaces between the geological barrier and different engineering barriers. The numerical results show us that the spaces can be closed with the volumetric expansion created by the steel corrosion and allows us to obtain some quantitative results on the processes developed in the disposal cell with the consideration of the progressive corrosion of metallic components.|","Document Type

Experiments have been performed with Mancos Shale under Brazilian tensile test conditions, addressing the effect of the angle between layer or bedding planes and the loading direction. A high-speed camera with digital image correlation software is used in combination with acoustic emission recording to monitor the fracture initiation and growth processes during loading. Although a clear anisotropy is observed in the variation of the P-wave velocity with the inclination angle, a significant effect on the Brazilian tensile strength is not observed. The mode of failure depends however on sample orientation. For all specimens, a main diametrical central fracture is induced first. It originates in the middle of the specimen and grows as a straight line or as a zig-zag line, depending on the orientation of the sample with respect to load direction. The zig-zag fracture is then a combination of a fracture along the weak direction and in other directions. Its evolution is an order of magnitude slower than that of a brittle straight diametrical central fracture.|","Document Type

Time-delayed deformation in rock is a common phenomenon which complicates interpretation of laboratory tests and creates uncertainty when results from laboratory tests are applied in the field. It is therefore desirable to include such effects in constitutive models used to describe rock behavior. One such model is the FORMEL model, which was developed to describe relationships between static and dynamic moduli of sandstones. The model has primarily been applied for prediction of stiffness and strength based on log data. In this study, we have introduced creep in the FORMEL model by recognizing that local failure events which induce non-elastic deformation may trigger new events of local failure and subsequently more non-elastic deformation, and assuming that each cycle in this chain of events has a fixed and finite duration. The resulting model possesses all basic features of delayed deformation  transient creep and possibly steady state and accelerating creep  depending only on the stress level. This extension of the model also introduces strain rate effects.|","Document Type

Laboratory experiments have been performed to simulate in situ and core compaction behavior of soft reservoir sandstones. Fine-grained synthetic sandstones have been manufactured under simulated in situ stress conditions with various cement contents. A systematic study shows that in situ compaction is close to elastic only under initial conditions, and that plasticity develops gradually during compaction. Two mechanisms control rock alteration as a result of stress release during coring: Cement bond breakage, which leads to softer and more stress sensitive core material at low stresses, and grain rearrangement into a denser packing, leading to permanently reduced porosity and hence increased stiffness compared to in situ behavior. The relative importance of these mechanisms depends on the degree of cementation, on the coring stress path, and on the stress level. Ultrasonic velocities have been measured and linked to time lapse seismic response of soft reservoirs and to the feasibility of predicting it with core material. Time dependent (creep) deformation has been observed, and appears related to the evolution of plastic strain.|","Document Type

A novel network growth model to construct larger scale fracture systems is developed. Aperture distributions determined by mesoscale geomechanical modelling are also transformed for use in larger scale networks. The precise aperture characterisation of a mesoscale outcrop sample (2 m <U+00D7> 2 m) is obtained by applying boundary stresses using the combined finite-discrete element method (FEMDEM). The scaling behaviour of the rock sample is examined and quantified for different properties (e.g. spatial organisation, length and aperture) using methodologies that employ power law and fractal geometry assumptions. To grow networks, rather than using the conventional stochastic network model, a self-referencing growth algorithm is developed to populate the geologically obtained pattern together with its geomechanically determined apertures. A larger fracture system (~ 50 m <U+00D7> 50 m) is constructed under a recursive scheme using random walkers to nucleate and propagate fractures in larger domains. Permeability of fracture networks grown to various scales is investigated based on flow modelling by the hybrid finite element-finite volume method (FEFVM). To conclude, this paper presents an approach to estimate hydraulic properties of larger scale naturally fractured rock and has implications for upscaling network properties for reservoir simulation, where no representative elementary volume (REV) can be assumed.|","Document Type

To study the importance of rotational modes of failure, the authors constructed physical models and tested them at different orientations. The study was carried out in three steps. First, a physical model was built consisting of two different tetrahedral block assemblies that could be placed on a tilt table. By systematically varying the orientation of the assembly on the tilt table and the slope angle of the tilt table, the block was tested to see how it would behave from rest, and each test was videotaped for subsequent analysis. Next, the physical model tests that exhibited rotational failure modes and tests with similar block orientations were analyzed for stability analytically assuming sliding and lifting modes only. Finally, the physical model test results were compared with the analytical results. The results of the physical model tests showed that the block failed by rotation in some cases, and in some of these cases, the analytical solution predicted a stable block. The results of this study suggest that rotational modes of failure may be the critical failure mode in some cases and should not be ignored.|","Document Type

In tensile and low confinement conditions, the tensile strength plays a critical role in crack initiation and propagation. Being able to accurately determine the intact tensile strength as well as develop an appropriate failure criterion across the tensile and compressive (shear failure) regions, are critical components of any rock mechanics project. This paper presents a summary of both indirect and direct testing approaches to determine the intact tensile strength. A review of the reliability of each method as well as calibration factors to refine the estimates provided by indirect testing methods is presented. In order to more accurately capture the behaviour of the intact rock in the tensile region, a modified Hoek-Brown criterion consisting of a tension cutoff is introduced. Such an approach utilizes the Griffith theory of brittle failure and the generalized equation by Fairhurst to define the tensile strength, and can easily be incorporated with current curve fitting methods. Finally, a method for determining the tension cutoff for data sets without reliable tensile data is provided for preliminary assessment purposes.|","Document Type

Fracturing stimulation technologies allow the oil and gas industry to effectively use fracturing treatments to improve the production of many shale gas and oil reservoirs. Because of pre-existing natural fractures in such reservoirs and their interactions with hydraulically induced fractures, hydraulic fracturing treatments often result in complex fracture networks (CFNs). The numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing of these CFNs is necessary for efficient and productive planning and development of such reservoirs. Fundamentally, hydraulic fracturing simulation is a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) that includes the deformation and movement of rock blocks, the fluid flow in opened fractures, and their interactions. A comprehensive study of the physics and engineering aspects of the FSI still present a challenge primarily because of their strong non-linearity and multi-disciplinary nature. This paper presents a tightly coupled FSI numerical model and computational algorithm for hydraulic fracturing simulations in predetermined fracture networks.|","Document Type

Wellbore stability is of critical importance in all drilling operations. Wellbore instability may cause stuck pipes, lost circulation, and/or collapse of the wellbore, resulting in high drilling cost and significant time loss. In this study, computer simulations using FLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua) were conducted on the stability of horizontal wells in shale formations. Laboratory-tested geomechanical properties of seven shale samples and in-situ stress conditions collected from the literature were used. Computer simulations were carried out to estimate minimum downhole pressures for maintaining wellbore integrity in each type of shale formation under different states of in-situ stresses. The results showed that the minimum downhole pressure to maintain wellbore stability is positively related to stress differentiation and pore pressure, and negatively related to internal frictional angle and cohesion of the surrounding rock. The determination of the minimum downhole pressure from the regression analyses may serve as a basis for engineers to quickly select proper mud density when drilling horizontal wells in potentially problematic rock formations, particularly shale formations.|","Document Type

A new approach to upscaling and modeling of geomechanical properties using clusters has been set-up for Vaca Muerta Formation in the Neuquen Basin of Argentina. Using wells with core and cross-dipole logging tools, a core calibrated anisotropic model of the formation has been established. Clusters were determined from a logging suite comprising only gamma ray, compressional slowness, and bulk density in a key exploration well, and this cluster group was applied to several more wells in the study area. Using microseismic data obtained from three of the wells in the study area with two fracturing stages each, the vertical extent of microseismic events was determined, and the clusters obtained through our analysis have been upscaled over this interval using Backus averaging. All four upscaled wells show similar results by cluster for elastic stiffness coefficients and Youngs moduli, with a very tight range of values. Poissons ratio is more variable and a vague trend with the clusters is noticed. When compared to the core data, similar trends are observed in the stiffness coefficients and Youngs moduli. These clusters have been used as geomechanical facies to populate a 3D MEM which can be used to couple the petrophysical model for the study area, regional stress model, regional structure, and natural fracture network in order to combine the fully coupled geomechanics and flow effects in hydraulic fracturing treatments. The method we have developed allows for anisotropic properties to be applied over a wide area with limited available logging data.|","Document Type

Fluid flow in fractured rocks has been a very difficult problem that has stymied many workers. A major cause of this problem is the disconnect between the geology of fractured rocks and the assumptions of Darcys Law. Darcys Law is based on the average permeability over a uniform mass of rock or soil, but the permeability of fractured rock is anything but uniform, and tends to be log-normally distributed with a high degree of variability. Darcys Law requires the arithmetic mean permeability but log-normal distributions are centered around the geometric mean. If the variability is low, the geometric mean will be close to the arithmetic mean so that the error is not serious. However, if the variability is high, as is typical of fractured rock, the geometric mean can be several orders of magnitude lower than the arithmetic mean, resulting in profound error and failed calculations. This paper shows how to obtain the arithmetic mean of the log-normal distribution so that permeability data from fractured rock can be used in Darcys Law.|","Document Type

The objective of this paper is to investigate the failure process of brittle rock in particle scale under compression with different confining pressures. Three-dimensional discrete element code PFC3D is adopted to perform the numerical simulations where intact rock is represented by an assembly of rigid spheres bonded at their contacts. The numerical model is firstly calibrated by comparing the simulation results to the laboratory data of Beishan Granite. Good agreement can be found between the numerical and experimental results in terms of uniaxial compression strength, Youngs modulus and Poissons ratio. Responses at particle scale are further investigated in order to gain insights of the micro mechanisms of the failure process of brittle rock. Increment of micro cracks is examined under different confining pressures. The development of micro cracks to a major fracture is investigated by exploring the location of cracks occurring at different strain intervals. Orientation distribution of micro cracks is linked to the orientation distribution of stress acting on parallel bonds. Moreover, the effects of confining pressure are examined by comparing results from uniaxial compression test to those of triaxial compression tests. With the increase of confining pressure, the micro crack failure mode changes from tensile to shear.|","Document Type

The long-term thermal-hydraulic-mechanical response of a generic salt repository for high-level nuclear waste is investigated. In-drift emplacement of the waste packages and subsequent backfill of the drifts with crushed salt are assumed. The aim of this research is to evaluate the long-term integrity of the natural salt and consolidated backfill barriers. For this purpose, we use an updated version of the TOUGH-FLAC simulator, able to deal with large strains and creep. The simulator also includes state-of-the-art constitutive relationships and coupling functions. The Lux/Wolters constitutive model for natural salt is used. The simulations are two-way coupled and include the stages of excavation, waste emplacement, backfilling and a post-closure period of 100,000 years. The simulation results show that the excavation damaged zone is healed within the first years and that the backfill reconsolidation is complete within the first decades. Depending on the magnitude of the pore pressure relative to the minimum principal stress, hydraulic damage within the host rock may occur at a larger scale. The comparison of coupled simulation results with those issued from a case that disregards the mechanical processes shows the necessity to account for the mechanical effect in order to accurately predict the long-term evolution of the barriers.|","Document Type

Upfront predictions of hydraulic fracturing and gas production of potential shale gas targets in Europe are important as often large potential resources are deduced without detailed knowledge on the potential for successful stimulation. Such predictions are challenging as they need to be based on limited available data, i.e. without well tests or proper case studies. In this study, a geological model was constructed for a representative area in the South of the Netherlands (Noord-Brabant province) where a potential shale gas target (the Posidonia Shale Formation) is present in the subsurface. Petrophysical analysis of rock properties and geomechanical analysis of the stress field are performed. The sensitivity of hydraulic fracturing to rock properties, stress state and treatment schedules was studied using a commercially available hydraulic fracturing simulator. A systematic series of simulations was performed for a range of input parameters to address geological uncertainty and optimum stimulation treatment. The results show that uncertainty in leakoff coefficient and minimum horizontal stress are most important in predicting fracture dimensions and conductivity. Minor upward growth of fractures is observed for all scenarios. Analysis of Coulomb stress changes due to hydraulic fracturing shows that opening of fractures alone is unlikely to cause fault reactivation.|","Document Type

This paper presents a numerical implementation of the coupled hydro-thermal-mechanical logic in the commercial code FLAC3D. The numerical model uses the Boussinesq approximation in which fluid density variations are neglected in all but the body force term of the equation of motion. The numerical solution is compared to an analytical solution (obtained using stability analysis) for a convection cell in a confined layer heated from below. Numerical simulation examples are presented to illustrate the development of various cell configurations in a layered system heated from below. The numerical model can be applied to the analysis of geothermal groundwater convection in sedimentary basins. The study of the convection mechanism is important because it provides a natural heat exchanger that can be accessed without engineered hydraulic fracturing because of high natural permeability.|","Document Type

True triaxial tests have been carried out in two quartz-rich, high porosity, sandstones, Coconino (n = 17.5%) and Bentheim (n = 24%) by maintaining constant but different <U+03C3>2 and <U+03C3>3 and raising <U+03C3>1 until failure occurred (<U+03C3>1, peak). For each constant <U+03C3>3 level, <U+03C3>2 was varied from test to test between <U+03C3>2 = <U+03C3>3 and <U+03C3>2 = <U+03C3>1. <U+03C3>1,peak for a given <U+03C3>3 increased with <U+03C3>2, reached a maximum (up to 15% higher than when <U+03C3>2 = <U+03C3>3), and then declined so that when <U+03C3>2 approached <U+03C3>1, <U+03C3>1, peak was about equal to its base value when <U+03C3>2 = <U+03C3>2. A separate series of tests was carried out using a novel loading path by maintaining constant Lode angle T (= 0°). This series of tests characterized the dependence of the octahedral shear stress at failure toct,f on the octahedral normal stress at failure <U+03C3>oct,f when <U+0398> = 0°. The latter tests were used to obtain the necessary parameters employed in a three-invariant failure theory proposed by Rudnicki (2013). The theory was then applied to predicting the variation of <U+03C3>1,peak with <U+03C3>2 for a given <U+03C3>3. The prediction reasonably replicated the typical ascending-then-descending <U+03C3>1,peak vs. <U+03C3>2 trend observed experimentally in both sandstones, confirming (with some limitations) the applicability of the Rudnickis (2013) theory.|","Document Type

A comprehensive understanding of rockfall trajectories is the key to effectively control rockfall hazards. An important characteristic that distinguishes different rockfall models is the presentation of the rock block in the model. Lumped mass models represent rock as a dimensionless point while rigid body models can consider block geometry in rockfall simulations. The potential blocks of the Mardin Castle are selected to study the differences between the lumped mass and the rigid body simulations. The trajectories of the lumped mass model are exactly the same for any size of blocks while rigid body models generate different rockfall paths and bounce height and run out distance accordingly. Increase in block size and non-circularity, cause large divergence between lumped mass and rigid body models. More reliable and conservative protection measures can be designed according to the rigid body simulations.|","Document Type

In this work, we present results of coupled fluid flow and geomechanical modeling associated with the Co2 injection at three different wells (KB-501, KB-502, KB-503) at In Salah, Algeria. Our recent numerical studies focused on the KB- 502 Co2 injection well, where a double-lobe uplift pattern has been observed in the ground-deformation data. The observed uplift patterns at KB-501 and KB-503 are different, with no clear influence of deep fracture zone mechanical response. In this study we improved our modeling with TOUGH-FLAC considering inelastic deformations in the injection zone, which responds to a Mohr- Coulomb failure criterion. For the case of KB-502 we introduced a fracture zone, modeled as in past considering inelastic deformations, but including a more detailed failure criterion. In addition, we modeled a stress-dependent permeability and bulk modulus, according to a dual continuum model. Mechanical and hydraulic properties of the injection reservoir and those of fracture zones at the three injection wells were determined through inverse modeling with iTOUGH2 by matching the simulated spatial and temporal evolution of uplift to the corresponding InSAR observations as well as by matching simulated and measured pressures. We found an excellent match between simulated and observed variables, with residuals well within the limit of the observation errors. The estimated values for the parameterized mechanical and hydraulic properties are in good agreement with previous numerical results.|","Document Type

Discontinuity sample size influences the experimental shearing parameters of rock joints. To study how peak shear strength evaluation depends on sample size several shear tests were conducted on artificial joints prepared with molds used for encapsulating rock joints. Discontinuity surfaces were shaped with two different saw-tooth profiles. For each one three joint surface sizes were considered: 64, 100 and 144 cm2. The same series of shear tests with dry joint surfaces was repeated with wetted discontinuity samples. Some reduction was observed in peak shear strength values. Tests with dry surfaces were simulated in numerical calculations that reproduced satisfactorily experimental results. Size effect seems to be more important when normal stress is high. With low normal stress imbrication cohesion is influenced by sample size. Some reflection is advisable to propose a transition from one situation to the other. Calibration of numerical models with more laboratory tests will validate them to be used in later developments.|","Document Type

A comparison of ground movements obtained from tiltmeter array with modeling results is presented in this paper. Results from the field monitoring and geomechanical models show ground uplift along the trajectories of Co2 injection wells.

During the lifetime of an oil field, well integrity should be taken into account under the geomechanical perspective. This work shows the influence of geomechanical effects resulting from reservoir development over the integrity of a well, employing partially coupled fluid-mechanical simulations. This paper also presents a practical workflow, implemented in a GOCAD ambient as a plug-in, to perform the mesh building considering reservoir and adjacencies besides the data preprocessing for the geomechanical simulations. The submodeling technique was adopted to analyze the rock behavior around the well in a local model, and the casing response under the geomechanical effects observed in the global simulation. The well casing collapse was evaluated in the submodel by the von Mises criterion. The simulation results showed the importance of employing a rigorous fluid-mechanical methodology in well integrity analysis, once the stress states in the well region were fairly affected by the accounting of geomechanical effects, reflecting on the casing yielding onset. The developed tool for pre-processing and finite element mesh generation allowed to perform geomechanical analyses in a simple and intuitive way, allowing the employment of the coupling methodology in the routine of reservoir engineers.|","Document Type

In this paper we propose a model for the compressibility of unconsolidated sands along a zero lateral strain stress path which includes the effects of texture and mineralogy on the stress dependent compressibility. It is first developed quite generally to describe the evolution of a network as a function of modifying the number of bonds and nodes in a network. This network model is quite general and may be applied to a variety of physical phenomena such as permeability, resistivity etc. Here the network is mapped to a simple physical model for compaction where the nodes describe a compaction site which activates at a specific stress and the bonds represent the structure of the grain pack. The higher the bond number the higher the threshold stress at which the site activates. The proposed model naturally includes nonlinear phenomena. In the case of compaction this would include the prediction of the onset of deformation band formation. The predictions of the model are compared to an extensive set of experimental compressibility measurements. Parameters describing the effects on uniaxial compressibility for sorting, angularity, and grain size are reported for pure quartz sands. Models are also developed for the inclusion of feldspar, clay and phyllite for quartz sands.|","Document Type

The Folsom Dam Joint Federal Project is being undertaken to increase the spillway capacity of Folsom Reservoir in order to meet the demands imposed by an updated assessment of the probable maximum flood. The auxiliary spillway consists of an approach channel from the reservoir, a control structure, and a spillway chute and stilling basin that discharge spillway flows into the American River downstream of the existing spillway. The stability of the rock slopes upstream of the control structure and approach walls were evaluated using kinematic analyses to screen for critical geometry followed by limit equilibrium analyses of the kinematically-feasible cases to design slope reinforcement where necessary. Variability in the joint orientations was accounted for using a probabilistic analysis based on the measured scatter in orientation for each joint set. A fully three-dimensional (3D) analysis of the approach channel sidewalls, taking into account both existing and planned excavation geometry, existing and planned rock slope reinforcement, and the planned reinforced concrete approach walls, was also performed.|","Document Type

In this paper, the use of microseismic data for calibration and modification of wellbore temperature models will be introduced. Moreover, fracturing fluid distribution obtained using the modified temperature numerical model is coupled with the microseismic field data for several Eagle Ford shale wells to improve hydraulic fracture stimulation characterization. By measuring the temperature change along the wellbore, distributed temperature sensing (DTS) data may provide relative fluid distribution. This information may be used to assess the simple geometry of the hydraulic fractures, the fracture initiation points along the wellbore, wellbore integrity issues, and the effectiveness of isolation tools. With recently published wellbore temperature models, quantitative information about which zones receive the stimulation fluid can be numerically solved. However, DTS measurements and fluid distributions calculated using DTS data are restricted to the wellbore and near wellbore environment. For far field diagnostics of hydraulic fracturing stimulation other measurements are needed, specifically microseismic. By combining these two measurements, a new workflow is created which incorporates both the far field and wellbore measurements to characterize hydraulic fractures, both real-time and after the stimulation job. This workflow is especially useful in reservoirs that are naturally fractured or in wellbores were stress shadowing effects are significant, such as multistage fracturing multiple wells that are in close proximity to each other. In these scenarios the path that the fluid travels may be complex, even in the near wellbore environment. Due to this complexity, fluid distributed calculations based on DTS data may provide misleading results. Using information gained from microseismic, the wellbore temperature models may be modified to increase the reliability of the numerically calculated fluid distributions. The purpose of this paper is to propose how microseismic data may be used to modify the wellbore temperature models, and how stimulation fluid placement determined from the modified models may then be coupled with the microseismic to improve hydraulic fracture stimulation characterization.|","Document Type

This paper presents a multi-scale lattice Boltzmann/finite element scheme that quantitatively links particulate mechanics to hydraulic properties of a grain assembly obtained from a simple shear discrete element simulation. A spatial homogenization is performed to recover the macroscopic stress from the micro-mechanical force chances. The pore geometries of the shear band and host matrix are then quantitatively evaluated through morphology analysis and flow simulations. Hydraulic properties estimated from multiscale flow simulations are compared with those inferred from volume averaging and geometric averaging schemes. Results from the discrete element simulations imply that grain sliding and rotation occur predominately within the dilatant shear band. These granular motions lead to dilation of pore space inside the shear band and increases in local permeability. While considerable anisotropy in the contact fabric is observed within the shear band, anisotropy of the permeability is, at most, modest in the assemblies composed of spherical grains.|","Document Type

This paper presents an experimental investigation on both monotonic strength and fatigue crack kinetics for Berea sandstone. It is found that for all specimens the Paris-Erdogan law is applicable for a wide range of the amplitudes of the stress intensity factor. The fatigue tests also indicate that there is a small-crack growth regime at the beginning stage, where the growth rate decreases as the crack propagates. The fracture kinetics for both the small-crack growth and the Paris regimes is subjected to a strong size effect. During the strength and fatigue tests, the damage process is examined by the digital image correlation method, and it is shown that the length of the fracture process zone under cyclic loading is about 60% larger than that under monotonic loading. In parallel with the experiments, a theoretical model is developed to explain the observed size effect on fatigue crack kinetics.|","Document Type

This paper describes how 3DEC can be used to model rock as an assembly of tetrahedral (tet) blocks bonded at their contacts and how this can be used to study veined rock masses at a large scale by introducing tensile strength heterogeneity at the block contacts. The 3DEC approach differs from particle-based methods in its ability to represent a zero initial porosity condition, as well as highly interlocked irregular block shapes that provide resistance to moment after contact breakage and associated high uniaxial compressive strength to tensile strength ratios and friction angles. An approach to constructing these models with 3DEC is outlined and the results of studies on veined rock mass strength and fragmentation associated with mining are described. In general, the results of testing to date suggest that the approach may be well-suited to studying the mining response of massive veined rock masses.|","Document Type

Longwall mining is growing rapidly in Illinois. A coal company was faced with crossing a 3-m normal fault in the development entries and the longwall face while mining a 375-m wide longwall face. Limited geologic and geotechnical data were available related to the fault. There were significant concerns about additional spatial displacements along the fault plane as the face approached and crossed the fault zone. These displacements could result in additional loading on the development entries on the headgate and tailgate sides as well as in the face area that could affect ground control performance in the face area. Field monitoring, observational and numerical modeling studies were performed to develop data that would assist the company to plan for additional supports in the development entries and take appropriate safety measures while advancing toward the fault and crossing it. Numerical modeling consisted of analyzing a 3-D structural model using the FLAC3D with the fault plane incorporated as ubiquitous joint. This model was used to analyze incremental displacements and stresses due to the deformations of the fault plane as the face advanced and crossed it. Additional stiff supports were installed in headgate entries around the stage loader and 60-m outby of the longwall face (solid).|","Document Type

An important question which arises during numerical analysis of mining is the residual strength of the rock mass since it significantly affects the stress-carrying capability of yielded ground and the potential for stress-shedding to more competent ground. There are few guidelines for estimation of the residual strength of rock masses. In many ways a rock mass that has yielded and subsequently bulked a significant amount acts similar to rockfill. Although rockfill shear strength is controlled more by fragment shape, fragment strength and porosity of the assembly than by the shear strength of discontinuities, it is possible to draw analogies between these two behaviors. For example, a bulked assembly of rock fragments and an individual rock joint have several common characteristics when subject to shear, including a transition from dilative behavior (with minimal fragment or asperity damage) at low normal stress to extensive crushing of contact points at high normal stress. These results in high instantaneous friction angles at low levels of confinement and a curved peak shear strength envelope for both rock masses and rockfills. In this paper the Barton and Kj?rnsli [1] model for predicting rockfill shear strength is explored as a criterion for estimating the residual strength of rock masses at both low and high strains (i.e. immediately post-peak and after a significant amount of shearing). The proposed model is tested through analysis of simple slope and pillar models.|","Document Type

Natural and artificial fractures in shale and tight sand reservoirs make commercial production of unconventional oil and gas resources possible. Identification of fractures in the rocks is critical in rock characterization and important to designing multistage fracturing in horizontal well to maximize the production. Although imaging methods have been used to characterize the fracture distribution, they are time consuming and expensive, and sometimes are constrained by the availability of equipment. In this investigation we developed a model to evaluate the fluid transient flow in a homogeneous rock sample, or non-fractured core sample. It is noted that all fluid flow behaviors in the non-fractured core sample should follow the developed theoretical model. Any obvious deviations from the homogeneous model indicate the existence of fractures or microcracks considering the fact that fractures have much higher flow capacities than those of pores in homogeneous rocks. Since the proposed model relies on permeability test data only, no additional cost is needed. The proposed model is a useful tool to identify fractures or microcracks in the core samples based on rock permeability test data, which are often available in core analysis.|","Document Type

The stress intensity factor at a fracture tip in a porous medium subjected to a fluid injection is studied. This factor evolves during the transient flow phase and tends to a limit value for the steady state. For simple fracture geometries without propagation and for constant injection pressures, finite element simulations show that this factor reaches its maximum value in the steady state regime. This result allows simplifying significantly the study and modeling of hydraulic fracture propagation because the determination of the steady flow solution is much easier and faster than the transient flow. In addition, some couplings between hydraulic and mechanical problems disappear under steady state flow and make it possible to establish some closed-form approximate expressions. These can be useful especially in the context of CO2 sequestration projects where the fluid injection is pressure-controlled.|","Document Type

A number of guidelines for the field estimate of intact rock strength are available. Although all vary slightly in terms of the boundaries of the strength classes, they generally rely on reaction to a number of simple index tests. The errors and uncertainties associated with estimation of strength using these schemes are high and strength estimates need to be treated with caution. Undertaking point load index testing in the field is a useful tool that can provide data to augment field strength estimates and laboratory test data. Field point load index test data can be converted to an equivalent uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) but this relationship should be calibrated through twinned UCS and point load index tests. A case study is presented for an investigation in highly anisotropic banded iron formation of the Hamersley Province, West Australia. The relationship between UCS and point load index strength for the site is shown to be strength dependent. The calibrated field point load index test data is provides additional information on the variability of the rock strength that could not be captured by limited laboratory testing.|","Document Type

The propagation of a single fluid-filled fracture from the surface of a semi-infinite isotropic elastic solid, subjected to both a transient temperature field and a constant source fluid pressure that is less than the confining stress, is studied using a boundary element method. Fluid flow in fractures is described by the lubrication equation, while the local pressure is determined by the strong coupling between elastic deformation, heat conduction and fluid pressure. Numerical results show that the combination of cooling-induced tensile stress and the source pressure can enhance the propagation speed. Parametric studies are carried out for identifying speed regimes and show the importance of the initial fracture aperture. Three speed regimes are found to exist. If the fluid penetration into the fracture is heavily restricted, the fracture length grows exponentially at early time, and then it suddenly reaches a large speed and progressively decelerates in a finite transition time as fluid diffusion speed varies, but eventually it follows the exponential fracture growth curve at a higher index for stable fluid flow in high-permeability fractures. The time-dependent crack growth behavior does not show any signs of unstable growth, even in the high-speed transition regime. The predictions of crack growth kinetics show a good agreement with some published experimental results and highlight the stabilizing effect of fluid transport on crack growth.|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing re-distributes pore pressure and stresses inside rock and causing failure by fracture initiation and/or activation of discontinuities such as natural fractures or layering boundaries. The clear result of this process would be enhancement of the formation permeability. In this paper, poroelastic numerical method is employed to investigate interactions of hydraulic fractures and porous rock. Besides, evolution of potential failure (microseismic events) during hydraulic stimulation is studied. The model uses indirect boundary element method. Temporal variations and pressure-dependent leak-off, hydro mechanical response of porous matrix, fluid flow in matrix, couplings of matrix volumetric deformation and pore fluid dissipation, and hydraulic fractures interaction are taken into account. Results clearly show the modification/redirection of principal stresses around pressurized hydraulic fracture. It also shows that modified stresses cause failure around the fracture tip which generally covers a bigger area than the fracture itself and could results in an overestimation of the stimulated reservoir volume. Then, pressurization of multiple parallel fractures studied. As expected, it is found that fracture geometry and the distance between hydraulic fractures are the most important factors in modifying the stress state and pore pressure and consequently extent of failure region. It was also observed that the opening of a fracture induces shear stresses on adjacent fractures. The SIF for pressurized cracks was calculated for Mode I and Mode II, and it was shown that when the distance between hydraulic fractures increases, the Mode I SIF also increases and the Mode II SIF decreases.'ep.|","Document Type

The stable and safe mining of deep tabular excavations is an ongoing problem of considerable technical and economic interest requiring an understanding of the interactions between local rock failure processes (metre scale), the structural impact of the overall layout shape (tens to hundreds of metres in scale) and the regional mobilization of geological structures (kilometer scale). In this paper, a limit equilibrium model is used to simulate local on-reef fracture processes that may also exhibit time-dependent failure characteristics. The traditional energy release rate design criterion (ERR) is re-interpreted as a metric of extraction sequence stability by including explicit energy dissipation mechanisms in the computational framework. A desirable feature of the limit equilibrium model outlined here is that it provides an explicit representation of the extent of the fracture zone near the edges of a tabular excavation that is responsive to regional stiffness variations induced by individual mining pattern configurations. The model is illustrated by considering the extraction of a raise connection through a pillar and by observing the implications of mining rate changes at one edge of a parallel-sided panel on released energy values. |","Document Type

Waterflooding is by far the most widely used method to increase oil recovery; however, it is less effective in heterogonous channelized reservoirs because injected water move easily to channels and left behind most oil unswept. Polymer augmented waterflooding is a technique by which recovery is enhanced in heterogonous channelized reservoirs. Injected polymer improves conformance hence recovery by diverting flooded water into unswept portion of the reservoirs. The stress change due to polymer adsorption could be significant and need to be accounted. 
In this study, implicit in pressure and explicit in both saturation and polymer concentration (IMPES), finite difference numerical simulation was formulated and implemented. The implemented approach is used to study the performance of polymer augmented waterflooding by varying relevant reservoir and well parameters. Both homogenous and channel dominated heterogonous reservoir permeability cases were considered with more emphasis on channeled cases. A Langmuir adsorption as a function of polymer concentration was used to account for the irreversible adsorption of polymer during flooding. The effect of polymer adsorption on mobility and permeability was accounted for by a viscosity adjustment and residual resistance factor formulae. The stress change created as a result of polymer adsorption and pore pressure change is accounted by explicitly calculating the stress after pressure is computed from the fluid flow simulator in each iteration. 
From the cases considered in this study, both permeability reduction due to stress change and adsorption of polymer has considerable influence on oil recovery. Hence it is recommended to investigate these effects for any reservoirs (especially for more stress sensitive reservoirs) during screening and implementation of polymer flooding.|",""

Diffusive Mass Transfer (DMT) can result in crack rebonding, and mechanical stiffness recovery. On the one hand, viscoplastic laws relating creep microscopic processes to microstructure changes are empirical. On the other hand, theoretical models of damage and healing disconnect thermodynamic variables from their physical meaning. The proposed model enriches the framework of Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) with fabric descriptors. In order to infer the form of fabric tensors from microstructure observation, creep tests were carried out on granular salt under constant stress and humidity conditions. A stress path comprising a tensile loading, a compressive unloading, a creep-healing stage and a reloading was simulated. Macroscopic and microscopic model predictions highlight the increased efficiency of healing with time. A preliminary Finite Element model illustrates the impact of healing on the stress distribution in the Excavation Damage Zone (EDZ). The model presented in this paper is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of damage and healing in rocks at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, and the long-term assessment of geological storage facilities.|","Document Type

The shear loading performance of fully grouted rock bolts is presented. A new experimental method, two types of rock bolts (D-Bolt and rebar), joint gap opening effect, and three types of host rock material were conducted. The bolts have similar loading capacity whilst the loading angle has obvious influence on the deformation capacity of the D-Bolt. The maximum total failure displacement of the D-Bolt decreases from 140 mm (0°) to 70 mm (40°, 60°, and 90°), whereas that of the rebar keeps a smooth increase from 29 to 53 mm. The deformation capacity of the D-Bolt is 270%50%larger than that of the rebar with increasing loading angle. The bolt has a larger deformation capacity in comparatively soft rock than in hard rock. A slight increase trend of failure load with a decrease of rock strength can be observed with 90° loading angle. The bolt subjected to 60° or 90° loading is much stiffer. The total stiffness of the bolting system is contributed mainly by shear component as the stiffness in shear direction rises significantly from 20° to 90°. The displacement capacity of the bolts increased with the joint gap.|","Document Type

Underground cavities in salt rock formations used for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) undergo cyclic loads and are subject to a fatigue phenomenon that induces a decrease of rocks strength and stiffness. A micromechanical analysis of this phenomenon is necessary to understand its mechanisms and elaborate relevant constitutive models. The polycrystalline nature of rock salt has a crucial effect on crack propagation and rock damage and, hence, on fatigue behavior. This behavior was investigated herein on the basis of self consistent upscaling approaches for viscous heterogeneous materials. The internal stresses in the polycrystal were modeled based on experimental data available for halite single crystals, and a monotonic compression test was simulated, which allowed tracking the triggering of fatigue damage. Results show that tensile stresses are developed in the polycrystal under global compressive load, the amplitude of which depends on the macroscopic load rate or frequency. These tensile stresses can exceed in some conditions the tensile strength of grains or of grains interfaces and cause cracking and damage in the polycrystal.|","Document Type

Petroleum exploration and production from unconventional oil and gas resources have gained great momentum throughout the world to meet the ever increasing demand of energy. Knowledge of geomechanical properties of target reservoirs ensures producing hydrocarbons from unconventional resources safely, environmental friendly, and economically. Pore compressibility is one of key parameters in drilling and completion design. Because the measurement of pore compressibility is time consuming and cost expensive, estimation of pore compressibility from other information sources is highly demanded. Pore compressibility indirectly estimated from other aspects not only is a good reference for the direct measurement, but also is an important supplement in case no direct measurement is available. In this study, we developed a method to determine the pore compressibility using permeability experimental data. The comparison indicates that the pore compressibilities from the proposed method match with those from direct measurement. The combination of the proposed method with direct measurement can be employed to ensure the reliability of the direct measurement and to quantify the uncertainty resulting from instrumentation and human errors, irregular core plug, and/or non-uniform deformation.|","Document Type

This paper is devoted to micromechanical modeling of the overall elastoplastic behavior and damage evolution in clayey rocks. The studied material is composed of a porous matrix which is embedded by linear elastic mineral inclusions. The solid phase of porous matrix is described by a pressure sensitive plastic model with a non associated flow rule. With a two-level homogenization procedure, the macroscopic plastic criterion of the heterogeneous material is deduced and takes into account effects of pores and mineral inclusions. Then it is assumed that the material damage is related to progressive debonding of mineral inclusions. The Weibull's statistical function is used to describe the varying probability of inclusion debonding. Finally, the proposed micro-macro model is applied to describe the macroscopic behavior of a typical clayey rock. Comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data show that the proposed model is able to capture the main features of the mechanical behavior of the studied material.|","Document Type

This paper presents experimental investigations on mechanical behaviour and permeability of a porous limestone. Hydrostatic and triaxial compressive tests with permeability measurement have been performed under drained condition. Permeability is measured along the axial direction. The results permit to identify two basic plastic mechanisms: plastic shear and pore collapse, and to characterize the effects on permeability. Under low confining pressure, permeability reduction is controlled by the deviatoric stress in elastic phase; after the onset of plastic shear, the deviatoric stress induces plastic dilatation and enhanced permeability; when the deviatoric stress reaches the peak strength, or the shear bands are formed, the permeability decreases slightly. Under high confining pressure, permeability reduction is also controlled by the deviatoric stress before pore collapse; after the onset of pore collapse, the deviatoric stress induces plastic compaction and weakens permeability; when the deviatoric stress reaches the onset of plastic shear, two plastic mechanisms are competitive, the permeability decreases continuously but with a reduced rate; finally, the plastic shear dominates the plastic mechanism and the permeability may not increase due to pore collapse. Generally, these works show that the evolution of mechanical behaviour and permeability is directly related to plastic mechanisms: plastic shear and pore collapse.|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique that makes the recoveries from the vast unconventional hydrocarbon resources in US economically feasible. Proppants are granular materials that are injected into hydraulic fractures to keep them open following a fracturing treatment. Hence, the proppant selection is of particular significance in petroleum industry. Due to recent advances in imaging technologies and high-performance computing, estimation of the elastic and transport properties of proppant packs at different closure stresses using imaged-based simulations is a credible alternative to direct experiments. In this study, transport properties (permeability and inertial flow parameter) of a ceramic proppant pack exposed to varying loading stresses are calculated using Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model simulations. The images of this packing shows rearrangement of the packing structure, embedding of the grains at the rock wall, and crushing of individual proppants. LB simulation results of this packing show that the permeability and inertial flow parameter are less sensitive to stress variations before crushing of the grains occurs.|","Document Type

The Marcellus Shale is one of the main U.S. shale plays with more than 140 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of recoverable gas/condensate (E.I.A) in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Using the appropriate completion and stimulation designs for reservoirs in a given location is crucial to increase the productivity of the play. Understanding rock properties and reservoir characteristics in gas condensate area and their behaviors during the well stimulation is necessary in order to optimize treatment design. This case study aims at optimizing well and completion design parameters such as well spacing, lateral length, azimuth or hydraulic fracturing properties and improving well productivity. An integrated reservoir study involving geomechanics, fracture design and production analysis was carried out, coupled to a multivariable statistical analysis. The purpose of this paper is to apply multivariable statistical analysis in conjunction with production analysis to understand the relationships between rock properties and hydraulic fracturing efficiency within the reservoir. Fifty percent of the Marcellus Shale is composed of clay in the area of interest and typically, clay shales are anisotropic in strength and deformability. The brittle failure characteristics vary from east to west of the play which can affect the proppant transport and ultimately the well productivity. The investigation is based on both proprietary and public information data for the Marcellus formation (around the area of interest in Marshal County, West Virginia). Production proxies, such as maximum gas and condensate rate in the first 12 producing months were selected and merged with well completion and stimulation data. Final data sets were then subjected to a multivariable statistical analysis and a commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application was used to understand geographical performance variation within the play. Fracture modeling and Rate Transient Analysis (RTA) were applied to this study to identify flow regimes and obtain determine some hydraulic fracture and reservoir properties. At last, the relationships between well performances, completion design and reservoir behavior were better understood.|","Document Type

In this study, both experimental and numerical studies were performed to investigate the impact of a bi-material interface on crack propagation. A set of thickness values for the weak interfacial layer was used in the experiments to investigate its influence on fracture propagation. In the numerical studies, the aforementioned experimental phenomena were simulated first, with the focus on calibrating the numerical model. Second, a numerical investigation of the influence of the strength and stiffness of the interface layer on crack propagation was performed. The influence of the interface layer permeability on the propagation of hydraulically generated fractures across the interface layer was also investigated. During the numerical studies, a simplified 3D Finite Element Model was built and used. The poroelastic plastic damage model is used to simulate crack propagation. The load of the numerical model for the 1st set of calculations is the point force in 3-point bending, which simulates the experimental phenomena. Loads in the 2nd set of calculations include the gravity load which balances the initial geostress field and the fluid injection flow rate.

From the microscopic viewpoint, caprocks contain microcracks which make caprocks anisotropic in mechanical and hydraulic properties. Additionally, the growth of microcracks could lead to permeability increasing exponentially, which extremely harms caprock sealing efficiency. To assess caprock sealing efficiency accurately, a fully coupled model should include caprock deformation, two-phase flow, CO2 sorption and damage evolution of caprocks. The purpose of this paper is to present such a model for investigating caprock sealing efficiency. Firstly, a conceptual model is proposed for the CO2/water flow in a caprocks with microcracks. In this model CO2/water flow is described by two-phase flow equation with variable porosity and permeability. This provides a solid basis to the further development of numerical simulations for the caprock sealing efficiency assessment. Finally, this fully coupled mathematical model is applied to a caprock layer to investigate the combined effect of fully coupling processes on the caprock sealing efficiency.

Conventional stability analysis of rock slopes during earthquakes is often confined to vertically propagated ground motions. One of the main reasons for the limitation is due to the lack of a rational yet simple way to apply an input motion of a specific incident angle. In this study a method of ground motion input was implemented for this application in analyzing a jointed rock slope. In a nutshell, it involved extending a problem domain by wrapping it with an elastic region and converting the incident waves into nodal forces in addition to make a boundary non-reflecting. The approach is general, but here only the plane strain problem was tackled and thus only two dimensional P-wave was considered. A jointed rock is defined by an elastic modulus, a Poisson ratio, the joint orientations and the strength of the joints. A 1:1 jointed rock slope of 30 m in height was used as the base rock slope. An El Centro record of 1979 was employed as the base ground motion. Three incident angles were considered in the analysis. Results obtained indicated that incident angles do have a significant impact on the stability of a jointed rock slope, and the severity of the impact depended on the relative orientation of the incident wave with respect to that of the joints.|","Document Type

In this study, a coupled poro-elasto-plastic Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to calculate a set of scenarios of fault reactivation which could occur. The potential for fault reactivation is estimated numerically for faults surrounding a well designed for drilling cuttings reinjection in offshore West Africa. This well is in a block bordered with 3 major faults. The results of these calculations on fault reactivation are used to design the injection pressure and further control the total volume of drilling cuttings which can be safely injected. Numerical results obtained with the FEM model include: distribution of equivalent plastic strain within the whole model, distribution of von Mises equivalent stresses, and the displacement field under a given pore pressure boundary condition at the bottom of the model. The plastic region is the area where the fault is being reactivated. In this way, results of both the location and the level of fault reactivation are obtained and visualized.

This study explores the application of an Equotip Hardness Tester (EHT) to unconventional shale formations for the purpose of estimating unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and further developing the logging of UCS derived by the EHT. This application of EHT overcomes the limitation of intact core recovery required for preparation of test specimens with standardized geometry for traditional rock mechanics laboratory tests where laminations in shale often prevent test specimen preparation. The EHT can measure the rebound hardness numbers (RHNs) to estimate UCS on the surfaces of both intact and laminated/cracked cores. Initial validation of the process was performed using aluminum specimens with six different lengths. Extensive RHNs measurements and UCS tests were conducted to develop new empirical equations for conversion of RHNs to UCS. The UCS log estimated by RHNs can be used to further calibrate petrophysical models and contribute to frac design by discriminating fracable zones and frac barriers.|","Document Type

The motivation is firstly to confirm existence of the post-injection surge in the AE rate observed by other investigators. Secondly, unlike previous investigations, a re-pressurization stage is included to test whether AE is driven by the interaction of the two hydraulic fracture surfaces as they contact one another during the closure period that follows an injection-shut in cycle. Our results show that the AE rate indeed increases when the pressure is relieved after the first injection/propagation stage. However, re-opening the fracture through a second pressurization and allowing it to close again proved unsuccessful in causing a second increase in the AE rate. Instead, the AE rate is observed to decay hyperbolically with the time from the first moment of pressure relief with no impact from the second injection/closure stage. This hyperbolic decay in AE rate is in accordance with Omoris law, that is, it is statistically similar to earthquake aftershocks. The AE in our laboratory experiments were therefore apparently not associated with closure but rather to the somewhat surprising propensity of the rock to produce AE aftershocks from the vicinity of a hydraulic fracture under zero-loading conditions during the hours to days following its creation.|","Document Type

Understanding how failure mechanisms and fluid flow patterns develop in response to fluid injection into a dense granular medium is critical to the design and diagnosis of engineering applications such as hydraulic fracturing and waterflooding in unconsolidated formations. In this work, the process of fluid injection with a non-Newtonian fluid is investigated numerically using the distinct element code PFC2D® coupled with a pore network model. The analysis assumes the fluid rheology to be power law. Effects of the injection rate and the rheological parameters on the fluid flow and grain displacement patterns are examined. The numerical results suggest that the near wellbore behaviors in the injection process are governed by the high shear rate rheology. As the injection rate increases, fluid infiltration becomes limited and localized failure characterized by the growth of fractures or fluid channels occurs. As the injection rate becomes large, the breakdown pressure becomes insensitive to the fluid rheology.|","Document Type

In underground coal mining, failure is expected to occur at pillar edges as areas are mined out and stresses redistribute. Depending on the post peak behavior of the coal and the local mine stiffness, the mode of failure can be either stable or unstable. In this study, a mechanically coupled numerical model is used to simulate a realistic mining process as experienced in underground coal mining. A discrete element model with softening contact behavior in PFC2D is used to simulate the coal seam, while an elastic continuum in FLAC2D is used to simulate the inner coal and mine roof and floor. In situ stresses are installed and a tabular excavation is widened to induce pillar edge failure. A series of PFC2D model behaviors, called stability indicators, are used to analyze the resulting failure. The stability indicators used here are the work performed by the damping mechanism, the kinetic energy, and the mean unbalanced force. The analysis demonstrates that the stability indicators are able to distinguish between stable and unstable failure. Also, the spatial distribution of damping work and contact softening shows the co-occurrence of model instability and damage.|","Document Type

The present work initially presents an overview and the theoretical background of the Material Point Method (MPM) and details of its numerical implementation for coupled fluid-mechanical problems. This method is particularly useful when analyzing large strain problems in solid/fluid media including coupled problems, in particular, for geomechanical and geological media. The method possesses both Eulerian and Lagrangian characteristics which makes it suitable for the solution of a number of problems especially when compared to the usual techniques such as the Finite Element Method (FEM). Using the FEM, sometimes remeshing can make the analysis of certain problems particularly cumbersome. In particular, in the present work the MPM is used firstly for the determination of the complete failure pattern of openings, from the initiation until its complete closure, in two different scales, laboratory and tunnel lengths. This problem may involve large strains and contact situations. The last example includes fluid-mechanical coupling under dynamic conditions. Here, the dynamic effects associated with the impact of a rock block in a saturated porous media in a slope is evaluated.|","Document Type

We developed recently a new apparatus which allows laboratory fracturing experiments under tri-axial compression up to 15 MPa with pore water pressure up to 15 MPa. Silica sands with particle size of about 125<U+03BC>m are used as the simulated formation materials. In addition to the sand, some amount of kaolinite flour is mixed for adjusting permeability. The mixture is layered in a mold to form a cubical specimen of 200 <U+00D7> 200 <U+00D7> 200 mm3 with aid of a specially-designed press machine. A fracturing fluid with viscosity of 300 mPa s is injected into a specimen through a slit of a steel pipe buried in the specimen. After the tests, we excavate the specimen bit by bit and observe how the fracturing fluid has invaded into the specimen. In the present study, to examine the effect of pore water on the fracture formation, we carried out the tests for the specimens under various conditions of water saturation, pore pressure and confining stresses. Then we found that the fracturing pressure changes in proportion to the confining stress, and it is not influenced by water saturation and the initial value of pore pressure.|","Document Type

Deep saline aquifers have a great potential for geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and proper assessment of host and cap rock is needed to guarantee that the procedure is safe. Temperatures and pressures at which most of the possible host rocks exist dictate that CO2 is present in a supercritical condition, having both gas and liquid properties. Hence, rock-fluid interaction has to be studied and measurements of poroelastic parameters are necessary. Sandstone formations are mostly considered as the possible host rock. However, in some countries only calcite-rich formations can satisfy the requirements for safe geologic CO2 sequestration.
This paper deals with measurements of poroelastic parameters of calcarenite (or Apulian limestone), which is 95-98% calcite. Jacketed and unjacketed hydrostatic compression experiments and undrained plane strain compression tests provided the full set of poroelastic parameters. Additionally, the specific storage coefficient was calculated. Inability to obtain constant values of Skempton B coefficient even at high pore pressures (~ 4 MPa) and the decrease in P-wave velocity with water injection revealed partial dissolution of calcarenite in water at high pressures. This phenomenon, as well as the mechanical behavior of rock in contact with supercritical CO2, are currently under consideration.|","Document Type

Elastic and plastic mechanical properties of liquids-rich shale rocks play a critical role in well placement and stimulation. In this study, elastic, plastic, and failure behavior of the Lower Jurassic Nordegg Member from various wells in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is investigated with laboratory triaxial compression tests. The triaxial compression tests show a wide range of elastic parameters, e.g. Youngs moduli ranging from <10 GPa to >30 GPa and Poissons ratios from <0.15 to >0.35. Mechanical anisotropy is also observed with vertically-oriented samples (normal to bedding) generally having lower compressive strength and Youngs modulus than horizontally-oriented samples (parallel to bedding). The characteristics of plastic deformation, brittle and/or ductile behavior, and residual strengths are also investigated. The variability in measured mechanical properties suggests the highly variable lithologies and fabrics in these samples. Efforts are made to delineate possible correlations between the rock mechanical properties, mineralogy, fabric, porosity, and pore-throat size distribution. The study also discusses the implications of the variable elastic and plastic mechanical properties on determining optimal placement of horizontal wells in the Nordegg Member, designing for multistage-fracture stimulation and selecting appropriate proppant. Proppant embedment and fracture conductivity are discussed using laboratory data and analytical and numerical analyses.|","Document Type

The implications of ice build-up on surface rock excavations can prove to be costly over the design lifetime of a slope. In areas subject to significant precipitation and cold temperatures, ice accumulation can unknowingly wreak havoc on surface rock excavations and lead to an increase in the frequency of rock and icefall events. Ice build-up can destabilize a rock slope by expansive action (ice-wedging), by surcharging portions of the slope face, and by inducing an ice-dammed condition where water-pressures are allowed to build-up on discontinuity surfaces as a result of inadequate drainage during periods of thaw. Although icefall may logically be treated as a variant of the classic rockfall problem, there are some significant differences between rockfall and icefall hazard evaluations. High-energy icefall impacts can also result in a significant amount of shatter, which can result in the release of ice projectiles. Ice build-up mitigation techniques can take the form of simple drainage elements and periodic cold-weather maintenance efforts, or can incorporate more advanced treatments like engineered topographic enhancements and bio-stabilization. In cases where source zone treatment is not permissible, engineered barriers may be incorporated for mitigating the risk of icefall impact to the traveling public where appropriate. Through our research and project case histories, this paper and presentation will describe some of the technical challenges associated with the burgeoning practice area of icefall evaluation, the importance of long-term monitoring and maintenance programs, and mitigation strategies for dealing with the under-appreciated problem of icefall at both the source and impact zone.|","Document Type

Spalling near a free surface in highly stressed rock is an open topic in design of underground openings. Spalling is often considered as an indicator of a potential collapse mechanism such as a rock burst, and therefore, is of high importance. In this study, a hybrid discrete-finite element model is used to simulate the surface instability. The bonded particle model was calibrated to mimic the mechanical properties of a Berea sandstone. Numerical results are compared with experiments performed using the University of Minnesota surface instability apparatus, which reproduces the state of plane strain near the free surface in a semi-infinite medium subjected to far field compressive stresses. The damage in the rock was monitored by acoustic emission. It was observed that the friction between the rock and the platens, as well as material ductility, affects the fracture pattern and the failure phenomenon. In particular, the existence of friction is important in providing lateral stress between the rock and the platen in order to assist the initiation of fracture from the free surface.|","Document Type

Nail pullout tests for the application of nail rock reinforcement were simulated using finite element analysis, and boundary conditions were representative of equivalent pullout tests. The numerical models combined a frictional nailrock contact formulation and an elastoplastic constitutive law for the rock. This approach was chosen in order to include both restricted dilation and frictional slip. Key properties were varied in order to assess their impact on pullout resistance. Cox's analytical shear lag model over predicted the apparent nail-rock contact stiffness due to inappropriate boundary conditions. The numerical model managed to capture the qualitative response of the nail during pullout, though absolute values of pull force were somewhat overestimated. The highest pullout forces were obtained when the strength of the rock was fully mobilized before slip occured. Nail-rock friction and initial contact stress were therefore the most important determinants of maximum pullout force. Radial specimen confinement and rock dilation did greatly influence maximum pullout force, but were more important in increasing nail displacement at maximum pullout force due to their effect on contact hardening.|","Document Type

An extensive measurement program was implemented by the authors for the former USBM during 1990s, in full cooperation with the mining company. The intent was to develop techniques for assessing changes in roof stability in underground mines and civil facilities. Initial activities utilized both static and tomographic techniques to develop a field method for assessing roof stability. These measurements identified the interaction among roof, pillar, and floor structural elements and related the deterioration in roof conditions to premature failure of the mine foundation (floor). Both static and geophysical measurements were obtained in the laboratory and in a western U.S. mine to study the in situ load-deformation behavior of floor material and to identify the location, timing, and growth of damage near mine excavations. This work was supplemented with three-dimensional numerical modeling to help explain the cause of damage.
It was shown that the stress field influenced the degree of damage to roof rock during excavation. Roof deformation and the extent of the damage zone grew rapidly as a result of failure in the mine floor. This failure was associated with pillar unloading and pillar shifting toward the abutment block, which increased compressive stresses in the mine roof near the pillar line. Laboratory and field measurements complemented each other, providing critical input for stability assessments and numerical models.|","Document Type

Some rocks, such as shales, are highly anisotropic in their mechanical behavior. In such rocks, the value of the maximum principal stress that causes shear failure depends not only on the confining stress, but also on the angle <U+00DF> between the maximum principal stress and the normal vector to the bedding plane. Triaxial compression experiments were carried out on two types of organic-rich mudstones at different bedding angles <U+00DF> and confining pressures <U+03C3>3. Two triaxial compression datasets from experiments and 10 datasets from the literature were fit to the Pariseau and the Jaeger plane-of-weakness (JPW) models. Results show that Pariseaus model is more accurate for 10 of the 12 anisotropic rocks, whereas the JPW model is more accurate for the other two rocks, which were both rocks that had a low degree of strength anisotropy. Post-test examination of computerized tomography (CT) and thin-section images shows that for highly laminated organic-rich shales, there is a transition regime of angles <U+00DF> lying between angles of about 10°<<U+00DF><35°, wherein the failure surface follows an irregular path that may jump between the weak plane and intact rock. In this regime, the strength of the rock is lower than the strength predicted by the JPW model.|","Document Type

Understanding the hydro-mechanical properties of shale formations is becoming increasingly important as they play important role in production of the unconventional resources as well as geological carbon sequestration where shales typically form the cap rock for reservoir sequestration. Fractures can provide high permeability pathways for fluid flow and leakage in very low permeability shales. The layered microstructure of shales can result strong hydro-mechanical anisotropy along with the stress dependence in shale fracturing behavior. This paper aims at providing a better understanding of: 1) fracturing behavior of shales due to shearing in relation to stress and intrinsic anisotropy, and 2) the effects of fracturing to the changes of permeability in shales. 
Triaxial compression tests have been performed on shale cored horizontally by simultaneously measuring the permeability and P and S wave velocities. Structural anisotropy of shale is evaluated in terms of Thomsen's (1986) shear wave splitting parameter. The relationship between permeability and splitting parameter suggests that brittle fractures are suddenly formed along bedding plane immediately after reaching macroscopic yield point at low confining stress, whereas shear fractures are formed gradually after yield point. It is demonstrated that the splitting parameter is a useful index for permeability of horizontal shale subjected to shearing.|","Document Type

We show an application of the Step-Rate Injection Method for Fracture In-Situ Properties (SIMFIP) which is dedicated to quantifying both discontinuities hydraulic and mechanical properties in situ variations using coupled pressure/deformation measurements in boreholes. The method has been applied to estimate the efficiency of fractured zone stimulation. The apparatus and operating procedure are first described together with data recording and processing. We show that SIMFIP tests generate and allow monitoring pluri-micrometer dilatant slip on pre-existing fractures, representative of mechanisms invoked in reservoir scale stimulations. In situ fractures permeability, elastic stiffness, apparent friction, dilation, and moment can be estimated from the slip, opening, water pressure and flow rate data that are synchronously measured during the test. In the presented case study, key results are that fractures well oriented for slip display a factor-of-40 permeability increase for a relatively small 80 x 10-6 m slip associated to a high dilation rate. Never the less, it also appears that the high dilation induced by the stimulation may cause a high mechanical weakening of the fractures, increasing the potential for induced seismicity.|","Document Type

Understanding the behavior of the fracture network allows for the potential of incorporating the observed fracture network into reservoir models necessitating the identification of fracture behavior over a wide magnitude scale -3 < M < +3. Here, we discuss seismic events that were recorded by a multi-array multi-level network consisting of high frequency geophones located near the reservoir and arrays of accelerometers and low-frequency geophones deployed near the surface. The hybrid system captures a larger bandwidth, allowing for the integrated analysis of the source signal at various scales. Comparatively speaking, our observations suggest that the larger scale events identified on the near-surface network contribute upwards of 80% of the overall seismic budget or seismic energy release associated with the stimulation process. Additionally, these events accounted for a further 11,870 m2 of activated fracture surface area, approximately 10,295 m2 more than would have been estimated from the downhole array alone. Overall, the identification of the actual discrete fracture network over many size scales allows for a better understanding of the fracturing processes associated with stimulations.|","Document Type

Surveys aimed at obtaining estimates of key fracture trace parameters should constitute a well-conceived sampling plan rather than adhoc measurements. If sampling windows are used to obtain data for estimation of fracture trace density and mean fracture trace length, the sampling plan should address the aggregation of data from multiple windows. The paper discusses estimation of density and mean trace length from this point of view. We demonstrate use of a first-order Taylor series approximation to represent the mean trace length estimator, and we show that this approach is consistent with a simple vector interpretation of data from multiple windows.|","Document Type

This study introduces an unload-induced direct-shear model to investigate the dynamic triggering of frictional slip on a rock fracture filled with granular materials. A constant shear stress and a decreasing normal stress are applied on the filled fracture, which is initially in a frictional equilibrium state. A displacement meter and two load cells synchronously measure the slip displacement and the applied normal and shear stresses, respectively. The frictional slip is triggered when the shear stress reduction is smaller than the normal stress reduction. The initial shear stress obviously affects the slip triggering under the same normal unloading condition. The advantages and limitations of this model are discussed at the end.|","Document Type

The main purpose of casing cementing is to assure zonal isolation and borehole integrity. The aim of this paper is to describe the elements associated with borehole integrity in salt zones. To achieve this, a numerical analysis of the contacts amongst the rock salt, cement and casing was carried out using the finite element method. The problem was divided into two parts. The first part focuses on a step-by-step procedure from drilling to cementing. The second part considers the long-term response of the wellbore after cementing. This paper focuses on the drilling of the wellbore and on the hardening of the cement. The casing was simulated as a metallic, plastic material with a von Mises yield surface with associated plastic flow. The cement was simulated first as an elastic material with a step-by-step strengthening gain and then in the last step as a plastic frictional material with a linear Drucker-Prager yield surface. Finally, the time, stress, temperature dependent behavior of rock salt was defined as a secondary or steady state double mechanism creep law. A non-linear, 3D finite element (FE) commercial program was chosen (ABAQUS), and some subroutines were created (FORTRAN) to develop the creep law. The paper also discusses issues such as salt in-situ stresses, induced stresses by the drilling fluid and slurry, and cement hardening processes. Developments of stresses through the different steps were analyzed and contact between these three different materials (salt, casing and cement) were also studied. The main contribution of this research is determining the effect of salt creep and contacts amongst the materials before, during and after drilling the well.|","Document Type

The evolution of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) entails spatially and temporally evolving permeability fields. During non-isothermal fluid injection, thermo-elastic stress and fluid pressure changes act upon partially open or hydrothermally altered fracture sets to enhance formation permeability. The physical couplings that drive this behavior are non-linearly dependent upon one another to varying degrees. To explore these interactions we are developing a simulator capable of coupling the dominant physics of shear stimulation using a variety of methods, allowing flexibility in the use of monolithic or staggered numerical schemes. The new simulator uses standard Galerkin and control-volume finite elements to balance fluid mass, mechanical deformation, and thermal energy with consideration of local thermal non-equilibrium and/or dual-porosity heat exchange between fluids and solids or fractures and intact rock. Similarly, changes in mechanical stress and fluid pressure can be rigorously coupled in single or multiple continua. Permeability is allowed to evolve under several constitutive models tailored to both porous media and fractures, considering the influence of thermo-hydromechanical stress, creep, and elasto-plastic shear and dilation in a ubiquitously fractured medium. From this basis we explore the coupled physical processes that control the evolution of permeability during shear stimulation and long-term evolution of a geothermal reservoir.|","Document Type

Shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas (CH4) in the United States over the last decade. Due to its unconventional characteristics, injecting carbondioxide (CO2) to enhance shale gas recovery (ESGR) is a potentially feasible method to increase gas-yield while both affording a sink for CO2 and in reducing the potential for induced seismicity. This study examines CO2 -ESGR to better understand its feasibility and effectiveness. We explore the roles of important coupled phenomena activated during gas substitution especially vigorous feedbacks between sorptive behavior and permeability evolution. Permeability and porosity evolution models developed for sorptive fractured coal are adapted to the component characteristics of gas shales. These adapted models are used to probe the optimization of CO2 -ESGR for injection of CO2 at overpressures of 0MPa, 4MPa and 8MPa to investigate magnitudes of elevated CH4 production, CO2 storage rate and capacity, and of CO2 early-breakthrough and permeability evolution in the reservoir. For the injection pressures selected, CH4 production was enhanced by 2.3%, 14.3%, 28.5%, respectively, over the case where CO2 is not injected. Distinctly different evolutions are noted for permeability in both fractures and matrix due to different dominating mechanisms. Fracture permeability increased by ~ <U+2153> for the injection scenarios due to the dominant influence of CH4 de-sorption over CO2 sorption. CO2 sequestration capacity was only of the order of 104 m3 when supercritical for a net recovery of CO2 of 108 m3.|","Document Type

Gypsum (a mix of Hydrocal B-11 and Diatomaceous Earth) is used by the MIT rock mechanics group as a model rock material. Unconfined compression tests on pre-cracked specimens with high speed camera observation showed macro-cracking processes of gypsum similar to other materials; however in contrast to the other materials, no microcrack process zone could be observed. On the other hand, environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) observation of gypsum showed limited micro-cracking preceding the crack initiation. This indicates that a microcrack process zone in gypsum might exist but it is not visible in high speed camera photography because of the scale. It was therefore decided to use acoustic emission (AE) to determine if such microcracks occur. To this end, prismatic specimens containing pre-existing flaws were tested under uniaxial compression, and the cracking process was monitored with both AE and high-speed camera imaging. AE results revealed that although ESEM images show the occurrence of some micro-cracking before macro-cracking, so far it could not be detected by AE.|","Document Type

The geological storage of Co2 and the extraction of geothermal energy from deep saline aquifers are promising methods, of mitigating global warming and obtaining a valuable source of renewable energy. In such processes the porosity and permeability of the reservoir rock are the two governing factors. Porosity can be easily predicted and is conventionally used to identify permeability properties. However, such identification is inaccurate, because the presence of irregularities such as bedding and authigenic quartz significantly reduces the permeability of even highly porous rock. This paper investigates the effect of bedding and the presence of authigenic quartz on brine permeability in sandstone using two types of sandstones with similar porosities, Warwick white (WWS) and Warwick golden (WGS), from the Queensland Basin, Australia. Permeability tests were conducted on 38mm diameter and 150mm long sandstone samples for a range of injection pressures (4  7MPa) under 10 MPa confining pressure at 30°C temperature, using a highly precise core flooding apparatus. The experimental data provide important data for the geological storage of Co2 and the production of geothermal energy from deep saline aquifers.|","Document Type

The key factor in successful construction of urban tunnel projects is selecting a suitable excavation procedure in soft ground. The choice of the excavation procedure strongly influences the cost and time for tunnel construction. The aim of this paper is to analyze delay in liner installation for tunnel construction using one- and two-pass lining system via three-dimensional finite element numerical modeling. The tunnel is assumed to have a circular cross section in Chicago glacial clays with a diameter of about 3.8 m and a centerline at a depth of 10.5 m below the ground surface. The soil profile consists of compressible clay deposits (i.e. Blodgett and Deerfield) and a relatively incompressible hard silty clay stratum (i.e. Park Ridge) and the tunnel alignment is assumed within Deerfield compressible clay layer. The thickness of the inner liner is assumed 12.7 cm. The constitutive model used to characterize the clays in the simulation is the Modified Cam Clay model. The soil stratigraphy was assumed to be uniform within each layer. The one and two-pass lining systems are modeled in ABAQUS using Model Change option and Load Reduction method, respectively. For load reduction method, the concentrated loads in equilibrium with the initial stress field are applied along the perimeter of the tunnel. These forces were sequentially reduced after initial liner placement to evaluate the creep effect. The results of 3D finite element analyses with emphasis on ground stability, axial and radial deformations of the tunnel, and stresses transferred to the liner are presented for both analyses.|","Chicago Glacial Clays, One-pass and two-pass lining systems,  Modified Cam Clay material model,  Load Reduction Method"

Fractures often control subsurface fluid flow and efforts to predict near-surface fluid flow typically focus on quantifying the relative influence of aperture and surface roughness on transmissivity. At greater depths, lithostatic and tectonic stresses play an increasingly important role in controlling fracture transmissivities. For the case of well-correlated fracture surfaces, such as those expected in new tensile fractures, fracture transmissivities quickly become negligible as a normal stress is applied to the fractures. However, if these fracture surfaces are displaced in shear, the fractures remain open and conductive at much higher stresses. Shear displacement of two well correlated or perfectly mated surfaces leads to anisotropy in the correlation structure of the fracture aperture field. In the presence of large normal stress, it is likely that only fractures subjected to some shear displacement will remain conductive, and thus, they are likely to exhibit some degree of anisotropy. Predicting the degree of anisotropy requires quantifying the combined influence of surface roughness, shear displacement of the fracture surfaces and the applied normal stresses. We use previously tested computational models to explore the influence of shear displacements of fracture surfaces subjected to a sequence of normal displacements (increasing stress) on transmissivity both parallel and perpendicular to the shear displacement of the surfaces. Results suggest that normal deformation of displaced fracture surfaces can lead to an order of magnitude increase in the anisotropy ratio from that observed in the unstressed fracture. These results suggest that the influence of normal stress on fracture anisotropy must be considered when implementing effective-continuum or discrete-fracture-network representations of fluid flow through fracture rock masses.|","Document Type

The overall strength of a rockmass is determined by the intact rock strength and characteristics of the rockmass structure. In complex rockmasses this structure consists of both joints and other fractures (interblock structure) and intrablock structure such as veins. As excavations go deeper, intrablock structure has been found to have a significant impact on rockmass behaviour. Complex numerical modelling for modern geotechnical design requires input parameters for structure, including normal and shear stiffness, and strength, which have a critical influence on modelled rockmass behaviour. This study focusses on extending joint stiffness and strength concepts to veins by calibrating numerical finite element Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests with explicit vein geometries that were determined by petrographic analysis of veins in thin section. In some cases, different calibrated properties were found to have equivalent stress-strain profiles in UCS tests.

Robust and reliable hydraulic fracturing models that appropriately account for random initiation of fractures, strongly nonlinear coupling among deformation, fracturing and fluid flow in fracture apertures and leakage into porous rock matrix, would be a key step toward developing a better understanding of physics associated with hydraulic fracturing process.

The coupled DEM-network flow model reproduces a variety of realistic growth patterns of hydraulic fractures. The effects of in situ stress, fluid viscosity, heterogeneity of rock mechanical properties and injection rate on the fracture patterns will be presented and discussed. In particular, simulation results of multistage horizontal wellbore with multiple perforations clearly demonstrate that elastic interactions among multiple propagating fractures, strong coupling between fluid pressure fluctuations within fractures and fracturing, and lower length scale heterogeneities, collectively lead to complicating fracturing patterns.|","Document Type

Sedimentary rock in the Earths crust is often layered and contains fractures which gives rise to two sources of seismic anisotropy, namely, textural and structural. These two sources of seismic anisotropy can have aligned or non-aligned symmetry axes depending on the orientation of the fractures relative to the layering. An acoustic wavefront imaging method was used on fractured transversely isotropic media to unravel the interaction between the fractures and the matrix layering. Wave-guiding theory for parallel fractures in transversely isotropic matrix shows that the delays of guided-modes are mainly affected by the fracture stiffness, signal frequency and fracture orientation with respect to the layering. From the experimental data, the apparent anisotropy was dominated by fractures at low stress because the energy was confined between the low stiffness fractures. At high stresses, the apparent anisotropy was controlled by the matrix because the fracture stiffness was sufficient to enable wave transmission across the fractures. The interpretation of the presence of fractures in anisotropic media can be determined if seismic measurements are made as a function of stress, which eliminates many fracture-generated guided-modes.|","Document Type

Existing laboratory methodologies for characterizing the pore volume compressibility of rocks are summarized. Special emphasis is placed on the two most common in the industry pore volume compressibility testsuniaxial strain pore pressure depletion tests and uniaxial strain effective stress loading tests. We carefully overviewed a rigorous mathematical description of uniaxial deformation of porous rocks implemented in these tests, derivation of pore volume compressibility coefficients from stress-strain data, and assumptions made in these models. Many industry-relevant porous rocks demonstrate nonlinear stress-strain behavior. As a practical workflow for characterization of pore volume compressibility, we propose using piecewise linear approximations of loading diagrams with constant compressibility coefficients. The linearized model provides a suitable description of nonlinear rock response within certain limited intervals of loading trajectory. For the correct use of established pore volume compressibility properties in applications, it is important to validate that predictions are made for the equivalent loading paths, stress, and pressure levels as used in the linearization intervals. Several examples of mechanical rock behavior were considered, focusing on the end-member cases of high- and low-grain compressibility compared with bulk compressibility. We also discussed implications of some rock microstructures, including mudstones, on mechanical properties, to provide a reference for better interpretation of real rock behavior.|","Document Type

An optimized velocity model is an important step towards the goal of accurate and precise seismic results. The assumption of a single or layered velocity model is not always appropriate in examples such as rock volumes that contain complex shaped geological units or large voids. For this reason, this study presents a 3D velocity model method that can be used for source location and source mechanism analysis. Examples from two case studies are presented with the first being an open stope mine, and the second being a block cave mine with 5 geological domains. Using calibration blast data, a significant improvement is shown when the excavation stopes are accounted for in the location velocity model. It is also shown that accounting for the shapes of different geological domains and cave voids produce more accurate raypaths for the seismic energy than from using a single velocity model and straight raypath assumption. This improvement in accuracy is benefiting the integration of seismic results with numerical models and the overall effort to improve the safety and productivity in the rock mechanics industry.|","Document Type

This paper describes a workflow involving a reservoir flow simulator coupled with a finite element geomechanical simulator. Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing jobs are modeled by simulating injection of water into the reservoir - using stage spacing, stage sizes and pump rates as parameters to the well models. Constitutive models are specified for fracture propagation and shear failure due to induced stress changes in the reservoir. Coupling is also provided through stress dependent flow transmissibility multiplier tables. Simulation based sensitivity studies are carried out on stage spacing and stage size as well as strength of the reservoir rock . Maps of the ratio between deviatoric stresses (at the actual stress states) and failure are built as a function of space and time (for the duration of the fracturing job). These maps can be correlated against maps of recorded microseismicity and used to better understand the mechanism and growth of the stimulated reservoir volume.

Tight formations or the reservoir rocks with extremely low permeability, make vast hydrocarbon fields in the United States and worldwide. In contrast to conventional reservoirs, production from tight formations is only economic when such formations are hydraulically fractured. Economic production from tight formations relies on the existence of a network of connecting fractures in the rock to create a more volumetric pattern of fracture. To achieve this goal, we have proposed a novel method for fracturing rock by thermal means, in which the rock is frozen prior to hydraulic fracturing, leading to a reduction of effective stress and creation of thermal cracks. The question is how much is the effective rock permeability improved by cooling down the hot reservoir. We use the discrete element method (DEM) to obtain a network of thermal fractures as the rock is frozen. The permeability can then be calculated using a pore network model which is not the subject of this paper. Here we present the Discrete Element Method (DEM) analysis for thermal fracturing and show the effect of main parameters involved in the solutions obtained from the DEM, including the stiffness of rock.|","Document Type

Often, a key factor in the successful hydraulic fracture stimulation of unconventional reservoirs is the opening or shearing (and later extension) of natural fractures or weakness planes around a created hydraulic fracture. The behavior of natural fractures, or weakness planes, in response to hydraulic fracture stimulation can be complicated. Furthermore, the stimulation of these fractures and weakness planes is dependent on several critical, in-situ conditions that can increase (or decrease) the contribution of natural fractures and weakness planes to well production. The optimal economic completion, then, requires considering these factors during both stimulation design and post-stimulation evaluations.
The simplistic, and traditional, assumption that hydraulic fractures are bi-wing, planar and symmetric around the wellbore has tended to bias the interpretation of different aspects of the stimulation process. However, hydraulic fracture monitoring methods, such as microseismicity, pressure evaluations, and the coring through of hydraulic fractures, have confirmed the complex nature of fracture propagation in unconventional plays, often due to the presence of natural fractures and weakness planes. Therefore, an improved consideration of natural fracture and weakness plane behavior during hydraulic fracturing will result in a better understanding of fluid treating pressures and hydraulic fracture geometry, which will help lead to more accurate estimations of production for unconventional plays. 
In this paper, the results of an extensive parametric study of in-situ stress conditions, in-situ pressure, natural fracture mechanical properties (cohesion and friction angle) and characteristics (joint orientation and initial aperture), and different operating conditions (single stage, simultaneous hydraulic fracture stages, and sequential hydraulic fracture stages) on injection (net) pressure behavior is presented. The results were generated using a 2-D distinct element model and capture the important role that, for example, initial natural fracture aperture and in-situ pressure play in the development of hydraulic fracture injection pressures in unconventional reservoirs.|","Document Type

Underground storage is currently being considered by numerous countries as a long term solution for the disposal of high level nuclear waste. Research and design within each national program is generally tailored to a specific rock type, such as stable granitic plutons, bedded salt formations, clay, and sedimentary rocks ranging from limestone to shale. One important technical aspect of these designs is the accommodation of the mechanical impacts of thermal inputs (heating) from the fuel as it goes through the remainder of its life cycle. The results of experiments completed in a variety of different geological settings, including FEBEX by ENRESA in Grimsel, Switzerland, the Drift Scale Test (DST) at Yucca Mountain, the Aspo Pillar Stability Experiment (ASPE) from the Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) in Sweden, and the Mine-By Experiment (MBE) by Atomic Energy Canada Limiteds (AECL) Underground Research Laboratory (URL), are analysed and compared to examine how thermal loading and the modelling process varies between different rock types.|","Document Type

In this work, a hybrid discrete-continuum numerical model was used to simulate hydraulic fracture (HF) crossing and interaction with natural fractures or weakness planes. The model provided unique capabilities for investigating effects which have usually been overlooked or not able to be modeled in many of the previous studies on the subject. Multiple effects, such as the influence of stress conditions, material in-homogeneity (stiffness and strength contrast), natural fracture properties (crossing angle and friction angle), and injection parameters (injection rate and fluid viscosity) were investigated in this new work. Three types of intersection between an HF and orthogonally aligned natural fractures were identified by varying the coefficient of friction of the natural fractures and the stress ratio. In addition, the intersection angle between an HF and natural fractures or weakness planes was found to significantly affect the crossing. Decreasing the intersection angle with the natural fractures impeded direct crossing and favored the arrest of an HF. Material in-homogeneity and injection parameters were found to also greatly affect the HF crossing of natural fractures. Ultimately, the simulations showed that the geometry of an HF can be greatly affected by the interactions with adjacent natural fractures and weakness planes and that complex HF propagation patterns will occur due to complicated crossing behavior during hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured reservoir systems.|","Document Type

The horizontal differential stress (HDS) in the lithosphere is mainly caused by plate motion. With depth increasing, the stress increases to the maximum and then decreases due to the fast rock creep rate at high temperatures. The maximum HDS and its depth may be related to the focal depth of earthquakes. Hence, studying the maximum HDS and its depth is helpful to understand stress environment of the focal zone. Knowing the stress gradient with increased depth in local lithosphere is one of important issues. In this study, the estimation of the maximum HDS as well as its depth in a region of western China was shown. The stress gradient with depth in local lithosphere was obtained by in-situ stress measurement using hydraulic fracturing method in 18 deep boreholes. As a consequence, the maximum HDS as well as its depth was determined by confining temperatures and mineral flow laws. The maximum HDS in the local lithosphere was 127~690 MPa at around 23~49 km depth due to rock compositions. The depth was highly possible close to local focus depth of most earthquakes before Wenchuan Mw7.9 earthquake.|","Document Type

Generally, the features used to evaluate horizontal stresses (breakouts, DIFs, on-gauged sections, LOTs) only give one equation. This means that the methods that evaluate horizontal stresses by focusing at one depth cannot be used to determine the stress state as one equation is lacking. Other methods assume relations between horizontal stresses and depth and evaluate the constants of these relations for the computed stresses to match well features. They are expert-dependent. This paper presents a new method to determine horizontal stresses that takes the best of both existing methods without having their drawbacks. It assumes relations between the horizontal stress magnitudes and depth based on geology and plots all well features into one single stability diagram. Then a statistical analysis allows calculating the constants of the relations and determining which features are effectively explained by the stress state and which are not. This method can be used to determine the stress state from features observed in more than one well and its results only depend on a priori assumptions and not on a posteriori expert decisions.|","Document Type

Fracturing in reservoir rocks is an important issue for the petroleum industry - as productivity can be enhanced by a controlled fracturing operation. Fracturing also has a big impact on CO2 storage, geothermal installation and gas production at and from the reservoir rocks. Therefore, understanding the fracturing behavior of different types of reservoir rocks is a basic need for planning field operations towards these activities. In our study, the fracturing of rock sample is monitored by Acoustic Emission (AE) and post-experiment Computer Tomography (CT) scans. The fracturing experiments have been performed on hollow cylinder cores of different rocks - sandstones and chalks. Our analyses show that the amplitudes and energies of acoustic events clearly indicate initiation and propagation of the main fractures. The amplitudes of AE events follow an exponential distribution while the energies follow a power law distribution. Time-evolution of the radial strain measured in the fracturing-test will later be compared to model predictions of fracture size.|","Document Type

The complex fracture network or stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) can be induced by hydraulic fracturing of the unconventional reservoirs. The SRV dimension is one of the main drivers in a horizontal well performance after the hydraulic fracturing operation. It is of great importance to simulate the SRV dimensions to identify the optimum hydraulic fracturing treatment parameters. In this research, a new analytical model is proposed to accurately simulate the SRV dimension created from hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in unconventional reservoirs. More specifically, a SRV dimensional model is developed to simulate SRV dimensions using effective stresses, injected slurry volume and other reservoir and pumping data during the generation of the hydraulic fracture network. The SRV dimensional model is calibrated using microseismic data from 6 stages of a hydraulic fracturing job in a horizontal well penetrating the Glauconite formation in Hoadley field, Alberta, Canada. The calibrated SRV dimensional model can serve as an optimal fracture spacing estimator for future hydraulic fracture job designs. The average simulated SRV width is smaller than the average fracture port spacing and therefore for this study it is suggested to have the fracture port spacing tighter and equal with the simulated SRV width for optimum production.|","Document Type

A finite difference method (Flac2D) and dimensional analysis have been applied to study a cavity developed through hydro-excavation of a mineral resource during borehole mining. The structural impact of differential internal fluid pressures on the cavity periphery has been numerically modeled. The research is focused on the effect of critical factors associated with the mining process on the largest principal stress in the rock (around the cavity roof). The goal was to observe the effect of cavity dimension, internal pressure (cavity pressurization), K (horizontal stress/vertical stress), vacuum (negative pressure), depth and method of extraction on the induced maximum principal stress. It was concluded that increasing internal pressure, cavity length, and depth of cover will significantly increase the induced maximum principal stress around the cavity. Applying negative pressure will cause stress concentration to move from roof of the cavity to the sidewalls and corners of the cavity. Increasing internal fluid pressure inside the cavity will increase the induced shear stress at the cavity roof corner.|","Document Type

High injection rates in water injectors leads to mobilization of particles in unconsolidated formations and creates preferential flow paths within the porous medium. Channelization in porous medium occurs when fluid-induced stresses become locally larger than a critical threshold (rock stress); grains are then dislodged and carried away, hence porosity and permeability of the medium will be altered along the induced flow paths. Additionally, rapid shut-ins result in pressure imbalance between the wellbore and formation. Flowback of the particles results in sand accumulation, and consequently loss of injectivity, which is a common problem in unconsolidated formations like the ones in deep water Gulf of Mexico. Experimental studies have confirmed the presence of dependent and independent flow patterns; however, there is no integrated model to describe flow patterns and predict probable issues for water injection at the reservoir scale. The objective of this study is to provide a model for a channel initiation/propagation during injection and flowback in injection wells. A finite volume model is developed based on multiphase fraction volume concept that decomposes porosity into mobile and immobile phases where these phases change spatially and evolve over time that leads to development of erosional channels in radial patterns depending on injection rates, viscosity, magnitude of in situ stresses and rock properties. The model accounts for both particle releasing and suspension deposition. The developed model explains injectivity change with injection rates observed in unconsolidated reservoirs.|","Document Type

Successful production of oil and gas from shale reservoirs and other tight reservoirs largely depends on the artificially-created fractures. The quality of the artificial fractures is determined by the geomechanical properties of the formation. Ductile behavior of the formation rocks presents a challenge in hydraulic fracturing, while sections with brittle behavior are the priority for fracturing operation. If the mechanical properties of the formation can be predicted without additional drilling, the hydraulic fracturing process can be better optimized economically. Utilizing the example of the Bakken formation, this paper investigated the regularity of the geomechanical properties and its correlation with the stratigraphic sequence. More than 160 Bakken samples of different depths from 8 wells were collected and used in laboratory tests. Geomechanical properties of these samples were measured. Based on the test results, these samples were categorized either as ductile or brittle. Then the variation of their geomechanical properties was correlated with the stratigraphic sequence. This correlation was established in order to provide an explanation to the variation of the brittle characteristic of the rocks. Since the general stratigraphic sequence model of the Bakken formation is already identified and mapped by previous researchers, this correlation provides an approach to predict the geomechanical properties in different intervals of the formation, and offers support in selecting, designing, and optimizing the hydraulic fracturing operation. The methodology developed in this paper can be also applied in other tight reservoirs and formations.|","Document Type

Our current laboratory investigations quantified the local stress states on a laboratory fault which control the transition of sliding from stable (quasi-static) to unstable (dynamic), commonly referred to as rupture nucleation. A fault was experimentally modeled using two Poly(methyl methacrylate) samples in a direct shear configuration. A pressure-sensitive film was employed to localize and map the contact junctions (asperities) throughout the interface A portion of the fault, characterized by a high density distribution of larger asperities, experienced considerably less slow (aseismic) slip than neighboring regions. Foreshocks detected acoustically were observed to coalesce in this region moments before the interface rapidly slipped. A high definition video camera was focused on this region and light passing through asperities appeared brighter than the non-contacting regions. Foreshocks in this slip deprived region caused, sudden changes in light intensity passing through these asperities and were concomitant with recorded acoustic emission. Source radius of failing asperities measured from the camera (0.56 mm) were similar to that estimated from the Brune corner frequency model (0.81 mm). Dynamic triggering of smaller strong asperities directly adjacent to larger asperities (measured by the camera) likely increased the high-frequency content measured in smaller foreshocks.|","Document Type

Downsizing an overcoring diameter to 60 mm (BX), the Compact Conical-ended Borehole Overcoring technique (BX CCBO) proved suitable for adverse conditions and difficult access from surface in deep levels South African gold mines. BX CCBO in-situ stress measurements have been carried out at seven sites at depths of 1.0 to 3.4 km, the measured maximum principal stresses, ?1 ranging between 76 and 146 MPa. In South African gold mines, such a number of in-situ stress measurements have never been carried out previously in the ?1 and depth ranges relevant to the described studies. The in-situ stress measurements allowed us to confirm that an assumption on far-field (initial) stress gradient was acceptable with only slight modifications. An improved assumption on far-field stress gradient allowed us to better constrain both the stress and strength on the M>2 earthquake faults with ?1 ranging between 100 and 177 MPa. The stress range was also confirmed by analyzing breakouts and core discings in a hole drilled through a ML2.1 hypocenter. At one site where 1 was 100~110MPa, a BX CCBO was compared with a CSIRO cell in a good agreement, although some issues were found to address regarding BX CCBO measurements.|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracturing has been an essential technique for enhancing production in oil, gas and geothermal reservoirs for decades. Constructive interactions between induced fractures by hydraulic stimulation and pre-existing ones are critical to the success of stimulation treatment and understanding this complex process remains a challenging task. A coupled hydro-mechanical (HM) process has been implemented based on the existing fracture mechanics modeling code FRACOD (Fracture Propagation Code) where the Displacement Discontinuity Method (DDM) is used to simulate rock fracturing processes. In the paper, we presented theoretical foundation of the code with the focus on the implementation of HM coupling. Two verification cases were provided in which the FRACOD results show a very good agreement with the analytical ones from Kirsch solution and the hydraulic fracturing process in intact rock has been successfully modelled. Finally, two demonstration examples were conducted to simulate the hydraulic fracturing in fractured rock mass to account for the interaction between induced and natural fractures.|","Document Type

Fracture mechanical tests on samples collected from the Crystal Geyser field site, Utah indicate that sandstones naturally bleached by Co2-rich fluids have significantly lower fracture toughness values than adjacent, unaltered sandstones whereas altered and unaltered caprock siltstones collected from the site yield similar values. Both the short rod (SR) and double torsion (DT) test methods give comparable results for multiple test specimens from the same samples. Co2-related alteration at the Crystal Geyser field site is reflected in the bulk mineralogy of siltstone samples collected near fossil Co2 seeps and primarily characterized by an increase in calcite. Dissolution of Fe-cements, along with the remobilization and precipitation of secondary carbonates and clays noted by petrography, are likely responsible for the geomechanical weakening effect in sandstones. Subcritical crack index, another fracture parameter obtained from the DT test, is also affected by Co2-related alteration. These results suggest that long-term mechanical behavior of Co2 reservoir and seal rocks may be affected by interaction with Co2-rich fluids requiring the consideration of coupled chemical-geomechanical processes and time-dependent geomechanical behavior in Co2 reservoir simulations.|","Document Type

This study investigates the impacts of rock anisotropy (mainly transverse isotropy, TI) on the near-wellbore stress distribution and the consequential creation of drilling induced tensile fractures (DITF). First, by utilizing an earlier analytical solution, a theoretical model has been successfully developed and implemented in conducting sensitivity studies. This model is applicable to any specific borehole orientation, rock anisotropy, and in-situ stress conditions. The results indicate that the TI medium can significantly influence the stress concentration around the wellbore, and consequently, affects the onset of borehole failure. Second, a tensile fracture tracing program has been coded based on the stress model coupled with Ongs wellbore-stability design code. Parametric studies lead to the following findings: i) en echelon tensile fractures appear in asymmetrical pairs, ii) fracture trajectories depend on the formation anisotropy. Finally, this model can help constrain in-situ states of stress incorporating with the DITF observed in image logs.|","Document Type

The displacement discontinuity method is particularly suitable to model crack and fault problems, as it possesses the property that the displacements at the two sides of the element are discontinuous, physically very similar to a crack or a fault. In this study, the displacement discontinuity was applied to simulate the transition of the fault system in central Taiwan from 1935 to 1999. And the results properly show the transition of regional stress field and the propagation of the faulting during the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. In order to assess and mitigate the risk of active fault induced earthquake in the future, it is essential to more reasonably link the stress analysis and risk analysis. A probabilistic algorithm was coupled with the displacement discontinuity method, and the coupled method was applied to the reliability-based risk analyses, with the consideration of uncertainties of mechanical and geometrical parameters.|","Document Type

In this study we will show how fractographic (i.e., fracture surface morphology) data of exfoliation fractures (i.e., fractures subparallel to landscape surfaces limited to near-surface rock masses) and three-dimensional numerical modeling can be used to infer orientations of principal rock mass stresses in topographically complex Alpine areas. Analysis of exfoliation fracture plumose axes, i.e., fractographic features that indicate main fracture propagation directions, and supposed local maximum compressive principal stress (<U+03C3>1) orientations at the time of fracture formation, suggests complex directional trends of near-surface <U+03C3>1 within trough valleys of the Grimsel region (central Swiss Alps). We investigated near-surface stress tensors with a threedimensional, elastic numerical model to 1. deduce evidence that plumose axes form parallel to <U+03C3>1 in an overall compressive (farfield) stress field, and to 2. increase our knowledge of near-surface stress orientations in Alpine settings. Model results illustrate that superposition of topographic stresses with realistic horizontal strains reveals complex near-surface s1 trajectories that widely follow the patterns of plumose axes. The model results demonstrate large variations of stress orientations, which cannot be captured by small numbers of classical stress measurements. In-situ stress measurements support exfoliation fracture formation under compression and principal stress directions as inferred from our numerical model.|","Document Type

Experimental study of a two cutters PDC bit-rock interaction shows that increase in the confining pressure reduces ROP through two mechanisms. The negative influences of confining pressure on the bit performance in addition to the rock strengthening under elevated borehole pressure (BHP), is the accumulation of crushed cuttings material in between the face of bit cutters and rock surface in the zone of penetration. The flow of crushed cuttings material on the surface of the PDC cutter causes additional confinement of the rock surface in the zone of the penetration due to friction.
On the other hand, utilizing a bit with an appropriate jet flow significantly improves ROP. In order to maximize the positive effect of bottom hole cleaning on ROP, the jet velocity has been raised to achieve cavitation condition by reducing the pressure with a high flow velocity ahead of the nozzles. However, the experimental results indicate that there are optimal conditions for applying a high velocity jet flow ahead of the bit, which yields maximum ROP when the cutters penetrate the rock mainly under the chamfer. After the effective cuttings removal condition, further increase in jet velocity no longer assists the bit to penetrate the rock faster.|","Document Type

Rock cutting mechanics has been studied in order to better understand drilling process in cutter scale. The cutting energy is mainly dependent of cutter orientation and rock properties. It was previously reported in the literature that specific energy is strongly dependent of backrake and siderake. Although there have been good attempts to develop an analytical solution to describe the cutting process, the siderake effects are not taken into account. This paper proposes an analytical solution for the rock cutting considering both backrake and siderake. The proposed model is considered for sharp and blunt cutters agrees with data described in literature. With the new model, specific energy can be predicted for any cutter orientation. Focusing on a parametric study for two hypothetical rocks, the model has shown that higher backrakes and/or siderakes increase the specific energy in a exponential-like trend. The backrake effect is strongly dependent of the rock internal friction angle though. The effects depth of cut and confining pressure were also investigated. Moreover, the effects of cutter bluntness are presented through the E-S diagram.|","Document Type

The difficulties associated with applying the digital image processing techniques and in particular digital image cross correlation (DIC) to determine the surface displacements of rock specimens in Brazilian tests are discussed in this study. In recent years, advanced digital imaging tools and techniques have opened new horizons to capture and monitor surface and even internal displacement fields. DIC is a noncontact method to determine displacements between two successive digital images taken from a loaded specimen at two different strain levels. Though the fundamentals of the DIC technique seem to be simple, in practice determination of small surface displacements on rock specimens could be a challenging task due to image noise, image resolution, surface texture, etc. In this research, the effect of image resolution, camera and lens types, different surface textures, and data interpolation to reach sub-pixel accuracy were studied. The results show that results are highly sensitive to the surface texture, size of the charge-coupled device (CCD) of the camera, and employing sub pixel accuracy generates smoother displacement contours. Moreover, in case of rigid body motion of the specimen using zoom lenses does not show any significant effect on the obtained displacements.|","Document Type

The mechanistic response of an Umbrella Arch (UA) support system that is used as a portion of the overall temporary support in poor tunneling conditions (weak/loose ground/subsidence prone zones) is not currently well understood. This paper compares existing empirical solutions to existing semi-analytical solutions related to UA support systems. The results of such a comparison illustrates the fact that most of the existing models have been designed according to conditions associated with shallow excavations. To date, there is no generally accepted empirical model has been produced in order to incorporate and capture the effects of an Umbrella Arch installed at depths. Therefore, in order to analyze the mechanistic response of an Umbrella Arch system in squeezing ground conditions at depth, a three dimensional (3D) finite difference numerical model was created. A parametric analysis was conducted on the interaction parameters (stiffness parameter in the normal and shear direction of the forepole elements that constituted the UA) to find a possible range of UA element deflection profiles. These deflection profiles were then used to test and modify the pre-existing semi-analytical response. The results of this study produced a new semi-analytical model for Umbrella Arches installed in squeezing ground conditions.|","Document Type

Hydraulic fracture breakdown and reorientation data collected from two test instrumented borehole sites have been analyzed to assess the effect of the initiation type on the treating pressure. Vertical boreholes were drilled and fractures were placed in a conglomerate at depths of 140 to 180 meters into a far-field stress field that favored horizontal fracture growth. Axial initiation resulted in high injection pressures, as a result of near-borehole tortuosity generated as the hydraulic fracture reoriented to align with the far-field stresses. A fracture initiation analysis determined that initiation at the abrasively cut slots should occur before axial initiation. Acoustic scanner logging of the boreholes after fracturing demonstrated that, in many cases, axial initiation occurred and when this was the case, treating pressures were high and consistent with near-borehole tortuous fracture paths. Transverse initiation from the vertical boreholes at pre-cut slots lowered the injection pressures by up to 12 MPa for water injected at approximately 500 liters per minute.|","Document Type

Salt rock mechanics has long been recognized as important in potash mining. Currently the petroleum engineering industry in Brazil is facing challenges related to this rock. Discoveries of carbonate reservoirs sealed by thick salt rock layers motivated researchers to consolidate background and workflows. Accessing pre-salt reservoirs means drilling through salt rock layers, hence special methodologies are required to evaluate the stability and integrity of wellbores. Salt rock has a different behavior than common sedimentary rocks, requiring special attention to deformation and dissolution. From a mechanical point of view, creep is one of the most important deformation mechanisms of salt rock in mining and petroleum engineering. State variables such as stress state and temperature are determinant for creep response. A representative constitutive model for creep in salt rock is particularly important in order to predict and prevent operational problems due to excessive displacements, such as the necessity of new drillings, stuck pipe or even wellbore loss. Three power-law-based creep constitutive models are investigated based on finite element simulations: Norton's Power Law, Double Mechanism Creep Law and Multi Mechanism Deformation Creep Law. The commercial finite element code ABAQUS® is adopted as the simulation tool, in which both Double Mechanism and Multi Mechanism creep models are coded as user subroutines. A creep analysis along an interval of pre-salt wellbore located at Campos Basin is carried out to compare the creep laws. Numerical results are compared to caliper data. The performance of the Multi Mechanism Deformation Creep model is highlighted.|","Document Type

Single Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) cutter tests were conducted with cutters of different diameters and chamfer sizes on Carthage Marble rock samples at pressurized conditions. The cutter size does not seem to affect the frictional response; however, the chamfer size has a considerable influence on the friction and aggressiveness of the cutter. Unlike the normal force, the cutting force was observed to be insensitive to the chamfer size for the same cut depth, in the tested conditions. Data analysis was performed and resulted in introducing an empirical relationship between the cutter back rake angle and the friction angle. This was then used to obtain the equivalent back rake angle for each chamfered cutter as a function of cut depth. The empirical relationship was also used to clarify the relation between the shear angle and back rake angle. The relationship was then combined with a recently developed analytical model for rock cutting to develop a combined model that accounts for the complex relationship between back rake angle and friction angle on the face of cutter. The combined model demonstrates decent predictability for Shale. 
This study has significant implications in cutter design, as it provides a more robust semi-empirical basis to account for the cutter geometry. It is also useful in enhancing current PDC bit simulations.|","Document Type

The Solution Mining Research Institute (SMRI) has recently embarked on inquiries into the effect cyclic loading (both mechanical and thermal) might have on salt. Some of this interest stems from the concept of using salt caverns as a storage medium for renewable energy projects (e.g., Compressed Air Energy Storage [CAES] with wind power) where daily pressure cycles in the cavern are conceivable as opposed to the seasonal cycles expected for typical natural gas storage projects. RESPEC and the Institut fur Aufbereitung und Deponietechnik (Chair for Waste Disposal Technologies and Geomechanics) at Clausthal University of Technology (TUC) jointly executed a rock mechanics laboratory study using both facilities for performing triaxial cyclic loading creep tests on rock salt recovered from the Avery Island Mine in Louisiana, USA.
The cyclic triaxial creep tests were performed under various load paths including compression, extension, and compression/extension. In addition, the tests were performed under both dilative and non-dilative stress regimes. The cyclic compression creep data was compared to static creep tests performed under similar conditions and the results indicated that the cycling of the applied stress did not have a dramatic effect on the specimens creep rate as long as the applied stress was not in the dilational regime. Furthermore, the cyclic compression tests were compared to a numerically simulated creep test at the same stress and temperature conditions, and the comparison matched closely for the nondilational loading segment.|","Document Type

The expected ground conditions in a geotechnical baseline report (GBR) are one of the most important aspects of any tunneling project  both from the owner and the contractor perspectives. However, often the expected ground conditions are presented with either a list of intact rock parameters, rockmass classification systems, or a limited number of domains along the tunnel alignment, all of which do not adequately capture the variability in the actual rockmass behavior. This paper presents a new method of incorporating the expected rockmass behavior along a tunnel alignment, where three critical geomechanics parameters (the in-situ stress, rock strength, and rockmass structure), are used to determine the entire range of rockmass behavior. A case study is applied to quantify the likelihood of each rockmass behavior occurring per individual tunnel domain along a tunnel alignment, producing one to four rockmass behaviors in each domain. The increased qualitative and quantitative knowledge of the expected ground conditions may improve project scheduling and costing, construction planning, and reduce the possibility of a differing site condition claim.|","Document Type

Cohesion debonding and friction mobilization along discontinuities are studied in the laboratory by monitoring seismic wave propagation through a discontinuity and measuring slip displacements using Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Slip was imposed on two individual blocks of gypsum through a contact surface that had both cohesion and friction. Investigation of slip was carried out by acquiring transmitted and reflected compressional, P-, and shear, S-, waves prior to and during failure of the specimens. DIC was used to monitor the discontinuity by measuring the surface displacement field. Direct shear experiments performed on gypsum specimens with cohesion revealed that debonding (loss of cohesion) occurred before the peak shear strength was reached, and that friction mobilization and cohesion debonding do not occur simultaneously along the discontinuity. In fact, the amount of slip that is induced due to debonding is an order of magnitude smaller than the slip needed for mobilizing the full frictional strength of the discontinuity. The loss of cohesion has distinct seismic signatures and resulted in a significant decrease in transmitted amplitude, an increase in the reflected amplitude, a significant reduction in wave velocity, and a sudden reduction of the dominant frequency of the waveforms for both compressional and shear waves.|","Document Type

The interaction of the loading machine and rock specimen is studied in this paper. The rock is modeled as a bonded particle discrete element system, while the machine is discretized using finite elements. Three aspects of rock-machine interaction including the effect of machine stiffness, end platen friction coefficient, and sample aspect ratio will be investigated. It is illustrated that the machine stiffness can drastically change the post-peak stress-strain curve; a soft machine underestimates the slope of the post-peak curve. The numerical results suggest that by increasing the sample aspect ratio, the effect of end platen friction can be reduced. Furthermore, it is observed that end friction is the main reason for the phenomenon of deterministic size effect and this size effect can be effectively removed if the end friction can be reduced to zero.|","Document Type

While the supercritical Co2 injection technology has been successfully employed for utilization operations such as enhanced oil recovery, there are some social and technical challenges with its large-scale implementation for storage purposes. Induced seismicity due to Co2 injection is one of primary concerns associated with the technology and it needs to be properly addressed. In this study, a set of 2D coupled Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) modeling was performed to investigate the effects of the reservoir porosity and thickness on the magnitude of induced seismic events. The model included a limited-dimension pre-existing fault which cannot be easily detected by geophysical surveys. The numerical modeling was used to simulate changes in the stress distribution in the reservoir, fault and surrounding rock due to Co2 injection. The fault slip obtained from the model was then correlated to the magnitude of earthquake for each case. Three reservoir thicknesses and three reservoir porosities were examined in parametric studies. The results showed that thin reservoirs have higher probability of failure and will result in larger-magnitude induced seismic events. Reservoirs with higher porosity were shown to have longer rupture time and larger events.|","Document Type

This paper presents a comprehensive numerical modeling framework integrating macroscopic continuum and microscopic discontinuum numerical modeling methodologies. The continuum model is formulated on the poro-elastic-plastic theory in combination of erosion law. The discontinuum model couples discrete element method with pore-scale fluid flow model (e.g., lattice Boltzmann method). The microscopic discontinuum model can capture most primary hydromechanical physics occurring in the sand production process but its computation cost is very expensive, so it is used to develop erosion laws through performing extensive parametric study in modeling small-sized problems. The developed erosion laws are integrated into the continuum model to investigate real-sized problems. The theoretical formulations of the poromechanics and erosion laws are briefly reviewed. The discrete element  lattice Boltzmann coupling scheme is described with a couple of examples demonstrating its suitability in serving as a virtual laboratory for erosion law improvement or calibration.|","Document Type

This study is to analyze pore pressure data acquired with a novel measurement system that is installed for a pilot test just outside a cased well within a sand formation in the North Sea. The system uses a wireless communication through casing to transfer measured data from well outside to inside. Long-term trend in the measured pore pressure is consistent with a formation-testing-based estimate. On the other hand, the measured pressure and temperature show rather high oscillation in short-period scale, especially during shut-ins. Finite element (FE) modeling study is performed in order to understand this behavior. We find that the oscillation is caused mostly by thermal effects in the tubing, not by any abnormal formation pressure, during injection. The FE modeling study also shows that the thermally-induced pressure oscillation can be removed, and the formation pore pressure is recovered. Finally, the FE modeling study is extended to explore potential behavior of the pressure data when the system is installed in shale formation.|","Document Type

The sudden change in drilling conditions taking place at an interface between two rock layers creates parasitic forces and moments at the bit, which locally perturb the borehole trajectory. This perturbation can be determined by coupling a bit/rock interaction law with a model for the bottom-hole assembly (BHA). In this paper a linear bit/rock interaction that accounts for the difference of rock properties across the interface is developed and coupled with a BHA model, simplified on account that the positions of the stabilizers are assumed fixed in position when computing the influence of the interface at the length scale of the bit. The BHA is then modeled by springs that prevent the bit from moving freely. The theoretical predictions for a cylindrically-shaped bit are consistent with experimental results reported in the literature. A preliminary study on the influence of the main parameters influencing the perturbation is also presented.|","Document Type

The deformation of synthetic halite is investigated at the scale of its polycrystalline microstructure. Images recorded during compression test performed in the chamber of a scanning electron microscope on centimeter sized samples are analyzed by Digital Image Correlation techniques and reveal the combined contribution of crystal slip plasticity and grain boundary sliding (GBS) and opening. Specifically developed processing routines allow us to quantify the relative contributions of both mechanisms to the overall strain, and their dependences with temperature. These surface measurements are complemented by full 3D analyses based on synchrotron X-Ray absorption computed tomography on similar samples. The analysis of the CT volumes at various load levels by Digital Volume Correlation routines, confirms the complex localization of deformation at the scale of the microstructure.

Fracture intersections provide connectivity among fractures and fracture sets, yet few studies have focused on methods to characterize intersections and the response of intersections to changes in stress. An experimental investigation was performed to determine if distinct elastic-wave modes exist that propagate along fracture intersections. Ultrasonic waves propagated along the intersection between two orthogonal, synthetic fractures in aluminum were compared with waves that were propagated through the bulk and along single fractures as a function of stress. Intersections give rise to several elastic-wave modes not observed for a single fracture that are sensitive to contact points along an intersection, i.e., a linear non-welded contact. In addition, observation of the intersection waves is affected by the relationship between the applied external loading configuration and the polarization of the shear wave source. Intersection waves have the potential to provide a new method for monitoring the condition of fracture intersections.|","Document Type

The viscous character of rock salt can cause problems during drilling and well construction operations, but can be favorable during well abandonment. The natural process of salt creep can reinstate the integrity of rock salt caprocks and create an additional well barrier. The method requires removing of a part of the casing set across a salt caprock formation. Differential stresses at the wellbore wall will initiate the process of creep leading to a reduction of wellbore radius and closure of an uncased wellbore section. Geomechanical numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate the creep-induced wellbore convergence in salt formations. A two-component creep constitutive material model was used, which takes into account the contributions of both the non-linear creep component, dominant under high differential stresses, and the linear creep component, dominant under low differential stresses. The calculation results expectedly show an increase in the creep strain rate with depth due to increasing temperature and differential stress. However, the creep strain rate decreases exponentially as the wellbore radius decreases. The shortest borehole closure time for a depth of 3.5 km, which is applicable to well abandonment in the K12-B CO2 Injection Project in the Netherlands, amounts to about 500 days.|","Document Type

The occurrence of roof falls in underground mines has been reduced, largely to improvements in roof bolt technology, but continue to be a common source of mining-related injuries and fatalities. Particle flow modeling is an effective tool for simulating rock processes and behaviors related to mining activities. In this study, particle flow modeling is used to simulate the deformation of a roof layer in a room-and-pillar mine. Shale and sandstone models are compared, as are different roof bolt configuration scenarios. As input parameters would predict, the shale roof models deform more than the sandstone roof models. Greater bolt spacing is also associated with greater maximum deformation of the roof layer. Similar, more detailed studies of this nature could be used for predictive modeling to mitigate the risk of catastrophic roof falls in underground mines and to optimize the bolt configuration for unique mine factors.|","Document Type

The long-term thermal-hydraulic-mechanical response of a generic salt repository for high-level nuclear waste is investigated using the TOUGH-FLAC simulator, developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the FLAC-TOUGH simulator, developed at Clausthal University of Technology. Although these sequential simulators rely on the same flow and geomechanics software, they are based on different numerical schemes. One of the aims of using two different approaches to model the same scenario is to gain reliability on the results obtained. The two simulators include state-of-the-art constitutive relationships and coupling functions. The generic scenario studied assumes in-drift emplacement of the waste packages and subsequent backfill of the drifts with crushed salt. The Lux/Wolters constitutive model for natural salt is used. The simulations are two-way coupled and include the stages of excavation, waste emplacement, backfilling and post-closure. This work has been performed within the framework of a collaboration effort between Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Clausthal University of Technology. Although the predictions presented in this paper cover a post-closure period of 100 years, it is intended to continue the benchmark until 100,000 years. The results obtained so far provide confidence in the capabilities of the two simulators to evaluate the barriers integrity over the long-term.|","Document Type

A study to evaluate the impact of operational pressure cycles on the long-term stability of underground hydrocarbon storage caverns in Singapore was performed. As the stored products are withdrawn for consumption and subsequently replenished during operations, frequent storage pressure variations inside the caverns are anticipated. This study evaluated whether such storage pressure fluctuations, which tend to affect rock mass strength and support strength with the passage of time, will have a significantly negative effect on the overall stability and operational life of the caverns. The study assessed the impact of pressurization and depressurization cycles on the global stability of the storage caverns using numerical models, while assuming progressive weakening of the rock mass and rock support. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to evaluate the response of the cavern rock mass to variations in a set of critical input parameters.

Strength retrogression occurs in cements at high temperatures when calcium silicate hydrate phase in hydrated cement converts to alpha dicalcium silicate hydrate phase. The higher the temperature, the quicker the rate of transformation of calcium silicate hydrates. This conversion changes the structure of the hydrated cement leading to increased porosity, permeability and lowered compressive strength. The real problem lies in the great increase of permeability which makes the cement conductive to corrosive formation fluids and therefore impairs the primary function of cement as hydraulic barrier material. Class H cement cores (water to cement ratio: 0.38) with slurry density of 1.97 g/cc (16.40 ppg) were cured at constant temperatures of 90 °C and 100% relative humidity over a period of 28 days. In addition, cores with same slurry design were cured in water bath at ambient conditions for 28 days as control samples. Higher permeability values in cement cores cured at high temperature shows the onset of strength retrogression. Lower Vickers hardness measured in the cement sample cured confirms the onset of strength retrogression. This is as a result of packing of large, coarse calcium silicate hydrate crystals observed using scanning electron microscopic imaging technique.|","Document Type

Stress distribution in anisotropic rock medium especially shales are very complex. This anisotropic behavior has a dramatic effect on wellbore stability during fracturing operation to extract oil. To overcome a high quality drilling in the medium, understanding of stress distribution and deformation regime is required. Different parameters of rock medium such as pore pressure, rock strength, and in-situ stresses make a crucial role in evaluating the wellbore stability. The Bakken Formation in Williston Basin, North Dakota, has different layers of shales with anisotropic geomechanical parameters such as Poissons ratio, Youngs modulus, shear modulus, and rock strengths based on the laboratory experiments. Although vertical drilling is the most frequent drilling method, it is not an efficient method for oil production; thus inclined wells are inevitable. In this study, mechanical performance of the inclined drilling method was investigated to fill the current lack of knowledge about its effect on wellbore stability in this anisotropic formation. The elastic anisotropic geomechanical model based on Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria was applied to analyze inclined wellbore stability in Bakken Formation shale layers using Finite Difference Method. To study the mechanical response of drilling in the anisotropic medium, stress distribution, deformation and plastic zones of the rock adjacent to the hole were examined. In addition, the effects of different inclination angles of the wellbore versus depth were studied. Results indicate a correlation between wellbore deformations as the drilling inclination angle changes from vertical to inclined orientation. Stress contours and maximum principle stress distribution indicate an extended zone of higher stresses around the symmetric line of wellbore.|","Bakken Formation,  Wellbore Stability,  Finite difference Method,  Anisotropic Medium"

Roof design is dependent on roof rock mass characteristics. CMRR was developed by studying the strong roof units of Appalachian coal fields and is used for characterizing rock mass, determining appropriate mining methods, chain pillar design, achieving lower coal production costs, and a reduced number of roof falls and worker injuries and fatalities. CMRR is determined by evaluating the spacing and frequency of bedding planes, joint sets, slickensides, other discontinuities, and strength of each rock unit in the bolted interval above the mine roof. This index ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 being a solid roof. In this study, roof support design of an Illinois underground coal mine is investigated to identify the applicability of CMRR-based design approaches to Illinois weak roof rock. The core information and rock lab tests are used to determine dry and wet CMRR. These values also are estimated using underground information. The connection between roof falls and designed roof systems will be discussed for coal mines with weak sensitive roof rocks. This study demonstrates the applicability of CMRR rock mass index for designing of roof supports in room and pillar coal mines with weak and moisture sensitive rocks.|","Document Type

Moradi, Southern Illinois University| Shafii, I., Southern Illinois University| Singh, K.S., Prairie State Generating Co.","|Abstract
Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) and Indirect Tensile Strength Index (ITS) are two of the most important geomechanical properties of rocks, which are used for designing rock slopes, excavations and tunneling. These parameters also have wide application in the mining industry since they are used in rock mass classification of roof, floor and pillars of coal mines to select the most economical mining method and mining geometry. Standard test methods for determination of UCS and ITS have been presented by prominent organizations such as ASTM and ISRM. However, the mentioned test methods for evaluation of UCS and ITS are tedious, time consuming and expensive, in contrary to the Point Load  Axial (PLA) and - Diametral (PLD) test methods, which are simpler and run quickly. Since the loading and the failure mechanism of UCS and ITS tests are similar to PLA and PLD, respectively, the correlations between these pairs are anticipated. The main objective of this study is to identify the relationship between the unconfined compressive strength and the axial point load test as well as the relationship between the indirect tensile strength and the diametral point load for the shale, clay stone and limestone roof rocks in the Illinois Coal Basin. The studied data are the results of rock mechanics tests performed on the roof rock core samples of a coal mine in Illinois, as it is established by the ASTM. The results indicate that there is a correlation between UCS and PLA, as well as ITS and PLD.|","Document Type

The paper presents further developments of the boundary element technique for solving three-dimensional problems of piecewise homogeneous elastic media containing multiple cracks of arbitrary non-planar shapes (previous results were reported in [1, 2]). In the developed technique, the elastic fields are represented by integral identities. Triangular elements are used to discretize the boundaries and polynomial (linear and quadratic) approximations of the unknown variables are adopted. In-plane components of the fields and geometrical parameters are arranged in various complex-valued combinations to simplify the integration. No singular integrals are involved since the limit, as the field point approaches the boundary, is taken after the integration. Analytical integration over each element is reduced to that over the contour of the element via application of Cauchy- Pompeiu representation [3]. The collocation method is used to set up the system of linear algebraic equations to find the boundary unknowns. Geoengineering applications of the method are discussed.|","Document Type

When drilling through shales, the borehole wall is fully exposed to the actions of the rotating drillstring and stabilizers, which can affect the wellbore stability. In the present work, we report a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) study of how the shale borehole wall is affected by prolonged exposure to a rotating drillstring/stabilizer and circulating mud during drilling. A for-purpose built pressurized cell was used to expose the samples to drilling conditions, and drilling-induced damages were preserved by fluorescent epoxy after the experiment. The samples were thereafter dried, and the zone closest to the hole was investigated by SEM and EDX. It was found that the strongly rotating drillstring/stabilizer caused shale ""smearing"" in the near-hole region, meaning that loosened shale fragments were re-deposited onto the borehole wall. This smear effect may have a stabilizing effect for a certain timeframe, and it is important to investigate the stability regarding further downhole operation in a well. This material may slow down migration of mud into the borehole wall, and thus contribute to stabilization of the borehole.|","Document Type

We propose a stabilized approach based on Nitsche's method for enforcing contact constraints over crack surfaces. The proposed method addresses the shortcomings of conventional penalty and augmented Lagrange multiplier approaches by combining their attractive features. Similar to an augmented Lagrange multiplier approach, the proposed method has a consistent variational basis resulting in stronger enforcement of the non-interpenetration constraint. At the same time, the proposed method is purely displacement-based and alleviates the stability challenges common to mixed methods. The method also retains the computational efficiency of penalty approaches by eliminating the outer augmentation loop necessary for augmented Lagrangian approaches and resulting in smaller system matrices.|","Document Type

Core samples obtained from sidewall coring hardly meet the specifications for strength or elastic property measurements as described in ASTM or ISRM. However, strength and elastic properties obtained from sidewall core samples during triaxial testing conditions are important in drilling, completion and reservoir modeling. Past percussion and advanced rotary coring wireline tools have been used to cut 25.4 mm (1.0-in) plug samples, but recent advances in technology have made it possible to obtain 38.1 mm (1.5-in) plug samples from openhole wellbores. Correcting for unconfined compressive strength (UCS) obtained from core plugs with length-to-diameter ratios of less than 2 is well established using the ASTM correction factor (1986). The suitable correction factor to apply for confined compressive strengths (CCS) and its associated elastic properties during triaxial loading is not well studied.

Strain capacity prediction is important for strain-based design (SBD) of welded pipelines operating in harsh environments involving discontinuous permafrost, active seismicity, and offshore ice gouging. Current strain capacity prediction models consider only a single flaw; however, potentially multiple defects neighboring one another may exist. As a result, practical engineering tools are needed to assess such cases. In the current paper, it is shown that the existing flaw interaction rules developed for allowable-stress design are not applicable for SBD, which can lead to overly conservative or non-conservative assessment. A combined numerical modeling and experimental testing investigation was performed to develop interaction rules for co-planar surface flaws specific to SBD pipelines. Advanced finite element (FE) modeling was used to simulate flaw interaction and full-scale tests (FSTs) were conducted to study the effects of flaw spacing on pipeline strain capacity. The FE modeling was first validated against the experiments and then used to develop surface flaw interaction rules through a parametric FE study. Using the rules, multiple flaws were converted into an equivalent single flaw resulting in the same pipeline strain capacity.|","full-scale tests,  flaw interaction rule,  strain capacity, Strain-based design"

Analysis of the rigid body dynamic performance for offshore pipeline plough is important for structural OPP optimization, fatigue strength examination and hydraulic system design.

The towing force of the offshore pipeline plough and force in the skid arm are calculated by the rigid body dynamic model using soil resistance as input in ADAMS. This integrated simulation model is validated by the comparison of simulation and land test results. The simulation results show that the towing force at the beginning of trenching process declines as the water wave height increases when the wave has negative amplitude, but there is less impact during deeper trenching. The towing force increases nonlinearly as values of the soil technical parameters rise steadily.

On-bottom stability of subsea pipelines has been the focus of substantial research in recent years with particular emphasis on the topic of pipe-soil interaction. Numerous models have been developed to predict the pipe-soil interaction behavior under combined vertical and horizontal loading scenarios. The Verley and Sotberg energy based soil resistance model for silica sand is among these models. The model is recommended by Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and widely accepted and used by subsea pipeline design industry to model the pipe-soil interaction on silica sand soils. Calcareous sand soils are found in many of the worlds offshore hydrocarbon development regions including offshore of Western Australia. The engineering characteristics of the calcareous sand are different from those of the typical silica sand soils. As such, Verley and Sotberg parameters for silica sand soils are not suitable for calcareous sand soils.

Suction caissons are widely used in mooring systems for deep water oil and gas development projects. The response of a caisson in sand is different from its response in clay under pullout force. In this study, three-dimensional finite element (FE) analyses are conducted to calculate the pullout capacity of a suction caisson subjected to various oblique loadings. The FE modeling is performed using Abaqus FE software. In the mooring systems, the caisson could have a significant movement and rotation before reaching to the maximum pullout force. Therefore, the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method available in the Abaqus/Explicit is used in the present FE analysis to avoid numerical issues due to excessive mesh distortion at large displacements that typically encountered in the FE formulations in the Lagrangian framework. The sand around the caisson is modeled using the Mohr-Coulomb model. The effects of key variables, such as loading angle, mooring position and aspect ratio, on pullout capacity and rotation of the caisson are presented. The comparison between FE and centrifuge test results is also shown.|","mooring position,  sand,  loading angle,  Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method,  pullout force, Suction caisson"

Jack-up rigs are mobile offshore structures that are founded on the seabed with the aid of spudcans or matted foundations. These foundations are connected to trussed or tubular legs supporting the rig hull and the legs can be jacked vertically during installation. To ensure stability of the rigs and to reduce the risks of instability arising from causes such as scouring, leg punch-through, etc., adequate spudcan penetration into the soil is required. Deep penetration of the spudcan causes large soil deformation. If the spudcan is close to any existing structures, the penetration may cause deformation to the structure foundation, such as pile foundation of existing jacketed platforms. As a result, a need exists to assess this problem. Numerical modeling of the process of spudcan penetration adjacent to an existing pile foundation is a challenging problem due to the complexity of interaction between the spudcan, soil and pile. In addition, soil has a very complex constitutive behavior which is strongly dependent on soil stratigraphy, soil type (sandy vs. clayey soils) within each layer and loading conditions (drained vs. undrained). This paper describes an advanced 3D continuum finite element analysis methodology using Explicit Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian (CEL) technique to simulate the spudcan penetration into soils and evaluate the effects of spudcan penetration on adjacent pile foundation. Soil and pile responses to the spudcan penetration are presented in this paper. As the state-of-practice to evaluate the pile response is an un-coupled approach by solving the soil and pile response separately, this paper also compares the coupled/un-coupled analyses to evaluate pile response to large soil deformation.|","CEL,  pile,  interaction, Spudcan,  soil,  finite element"

As a quasi-static analysis, the configuration and tension distribution of various mooring lines are presented under the combined impact of currents and waves. The hydrodynamic loads of current and wave are calculated by using Airy wave theory and Morison equation. Then, the interaction between mooring lines and soil is also considered in this paper. A comprehensive comparison between the present model and previous result is performed and shows good agreement.

The offshore wind industry has in recent years showed an interest for using suction buckets for foundations of Offshore Wind Turbines (OWT). Bucket foundations can be used both with monopod support structures and multi-leg support structures as an alternative to monopiles, gravity based foundations and piles. This paper discusses whether the experience from design of foundations for oil and gas structures and the general procedure considering cyclic loading of soils are applicable to bucket foundations for OWTs. The general framework based on the stress path method and the accumulation procedure have earlier shown to be applicable for different foundation problems. The procedure has been verified in model and field tests and some of them are relevant for OWT conditions. Tests and findings from research outside NGI focusing on buckets foundations for OWT are discussed in light of the NGI-procedure. The paper explain why some of the recommendations in literature regarding tension loading of buckets are too conservative.

With the increasing of extreme weather events, more attention has been drawn to the protection of coastal structures. Wave-induced seabed instability is a major factor that may damage the coastal structures. In this paper, a 2-D quasi-dynamic u-w-p model is developed to examine different seabed behavior under different wave actions. Further, this paper aims to acquire a better understanding of the soil failure process, which will be able to reduce the possible damage of coastal structure caused by extreme weather events. In u-w-p model, acceleration, velocity, and displacement terms are considered separately for both solid and fluid phases. The u-w-p model also can be simplified based on actual condition. The governing equations of u-w-p model are deduced from constitutive law and conservation law under certain assumptions. The numerical solutions are developed by using finite difference method (FDM) and three major factors (pore water pressure, effective vertical stress and shear stress) are outputted from the models as major analysis target. The result shows that both liquefaction and shear failure have low potential to occur in clayey seabed, this may caused by the dense soil structure and low permeability of clay. The pore water pressure vary linearly according to the depth, however, this variation is not significant in clayey seabed (with 6.4% decrease from the surface to bottom). In addition, there is no phase lag in clayey seabed. The excess pore water pressure will not accumulate quickly and reach a massive value inside the clayey seabed.|","shear failure,  linear wave theory, Finite Difference Method,  seabed"

Significant uncertainty exists in terms of the underlying soil failure mechanisms governing the behaviour of displacement piles in sand. In addition, the installing pile (diameter D = 0.5~3 m) with a trapped soil wedge at the base and/or the using of a driving shoe often creates a conical tip. This resembles the geometry of finless torpedo anchor (D = 0.8~1.2 m) and cone penetrometer (in lower scale with D = 0.035~0.0437 m). This paper describes large deformation finite element (LDFE) analysis of the penetration of conical pile foundations in silica sand, identifying the evolving soil failure mechanisms around the object and the end bearing resistance. The results are validated against centrifuge test data, with reasonable agreement obtained. The pile tip angle and sand relative density are shown to have significant influence on the mobilised soil deformation patterns and consequent end bearing resistance. Higher penetration resistance and more proportion of vertical soil flow (concentrating adjacent to the advancing pile) are in associated with higher relative density and greater tip angle.|","large deformation FE,  soil flow mechanisms, Pile foundations,  silica sand,  end bearing resistance"

The spudcan requires the suitable design considering the soil, platform, and environmental conditions. Its shape needs to be designed to secure sufficient reaction of soil so that it can prevent overturning accidents. Its shape also has to minimize the installation and extraction time. Even in the same soil condition, the reaction of soil may be different depending on the shape of spudcan, mainly the slope of top and bottom plates. Therefore, in this study, the relation between the slope of plates and the reaction of soil with and without water jetting is analyzed to better understand their interactions and correlations. For the investigation, a wind turbine installation vessel (WTIV) is selected as the target jack-up platform and the Gulf of Mexico is considered as the target site. A multi layered (sand overlying clay) soil profile is applied as the assumed soil condition and the soil-structure interaction (SSI) analysis is performed by using ANSYS to analyze the effect of the slope change of the bottom plate and water jetting on the reaction of soil. This kind of investigation and simulation is needed to develop optimal and smart spudcan in the future. |","Soil-Structure Interaction model, Jack-up platform,  Finite Element Analysis,  Water jetting,  Top and bottom plates,  Structural design,  Optimal slope,  Spudcan"

Nearby field production effects in field development is a key consideration in well design for safe well delivery and HSE considerations. Formation Pore Pressure Prediction (PPP) aims to identify and manage formation pressures with associated subsurface uncertainties/risks, and serves as input into well design and delivery. Reservoir injectivity, depletion from hydraulic communication with other reservoirs, and fault seal reactivation, amongst others are some of the common processes that could alter the in-situ pore pressures of virgin reservoirs. Thus planning a well where these subsurface uncertainties and more exist, would pose the challenge of quantifying the uncertainties and incorporating them into the wells PPP/design to allow for safe well operations, protecting lives, properties, and the environment. 
This was the case of a development oil well (Oganza-015), planned to be drilled into the virgin and appraised block-B of the Oganza Field in the Niger Delta. Regional (map and correlation) and Production data from the field suggest that some of the reservoirs are in hydraulic communication with two producing nearby fields (Okpokiri and Ekunam) via a common aquifer, and as such would have seen some level of depletion due to production from these nearby fields. Other identified subsurface uncertainties in this block include, the reservoir structural tops and bases, fluid contacts (original vs. present), fluid type and density/gradient, connectivity between blocks (by aquifer or hydrocarbon zones), fault extension and transmissibility, strength of aquifer/gas cap, etc. Related risks with drilling through these depleted reservoirs include; mud losses that could lead to a well control situation, differential sticking and loss of drill string with BHA, casing burst, and other reservoir management issues. 
An integrated approach via quantitative seismic interpretation, appraisal, development, and production data analyses in PPP for the planned Oganza-015 well was adopted to manage the aforementioned uncertainties and associated risks. This incorporated all available seismic (seismic velocity), geological (maps and sand correlation), petrophysical (porosity sensing well logs, fluid type and gradients), reservoir engineering (RFT, PVT), drilling (mud weights, drillability exponent), and production (BHP) data. 
This work further demonstrated that the Oganza Field is hydrostatic in-situ with average pressure gradient of 0.433psi/ft, and that slight depletion (ca. 0.425psi/ft.) at some deeper reservoir levels has occurred. These and other subsurface uncertainties were taken into consideration in the PPP that has been put forward for a safe well design and delivery. 
In this paper, a PPP workflow for design and safe delivery of development wells targeting and/or traversing virgin reservoirs under depletion using seismic velocity and appraisal well data is presented.|",""

A novel methodology of predicting sand debris production based on the yield zone and fracture energy dissipation of experimentally produced shear fractures, created under various triaxial stress states, is presented. This technique involves determination of the lateral extent of the failed rock around a wellbore, quantifying the energy available for fracturing and applying experimentally determined comminution constants to estimate the volume and mass of debris created. In more brittle and competent rocks, grains are deformed elastically with increasing stress, storing strain energy in the process. During failure, the stored strain energy is released as heat energy, seismic energy and also in the context of sand production as comminution of grains into debris. 
The proportion of energy which accounts for the generated debris is estimated from the ratio of the energy dissipated in the creation of debris (EA) to the fracture surface energy (GIIC) required for the extension of the failure surface. The fracture surface energy (GIIC) is determined from the shear stress on the failure surface and the slip along it (slip weakening curve) generated during triaxial tests. The debris will be accumulated between the failure surfaces and may be available for sand production. This technique is used to determine the propensity of sand production of several reservoir sandstones.|","Document Type

Subsea development with long tieback to the beach is becoming the most economic cost effect method for deepwater development 
In such deepwater environments multiphase fluid production accompanied by sand production is inevitable. Subsea developments/tiebacks are risk averse to sand/multiphase production for effective flow assurance. 
The major challenges for the asset teams  in the development of  such fields are in how to: 
Provide inputs into the subsea and topsides design in terms of possible quantity and particle size distribution of sand, and frequency of sand produced and transported  through the wellbore into the subsea and topside facilities |Optimise  the well design that is fit-for-purpose |Maximize the  individual wells  production and field development performance |Effectively manage the sand and multiphase fluid production as well as the facilities integrity |Deploy appropriate sand management strategy that is fit for purpose including Critical evaluation of appropriate  sand control method  Surface Control vs Subsurface |Minimise the impact of sand production on the wells and subsea production facilities |Minimize operational cost and non-productive time and guarantee flow assurance  end-to end across the entire composite production system from reservoir through the wellbore to the topside and flow lines |Manage the waste disposal including the environmental impact assessment arising thereof. 
Achieving these objectives is the driver for our unique integrated engineering service and solutions strategy presented in this paper. 
The paper presents the step by step total sand management solution strategy that can enable managers of the subsea installations and complex fields to improve intervention and production efficiency through continuous process optimisation, reducing non-productive time and also guaranteeing flow assurance that can reduce lifting costs per barrel. The systematic approach is supported with the case study of a recent subsea development project study in the Gulf of Guinea field characterised by stacked volatile oil/condensate heterogeneous sand pools in 5000ft of water depth supported by detailed illustration of how the key geology and geophysics (G&G)  and engineering data have been harvested for the integrated risk assessment. The reservoirs are being developed and produced via subsea flowlines, production manifolds, pipelines and risers to an FPSO. Pattern waterflood is also incorporated using seawater as injection source 
The paper for the first time introduces the SMARTSAND Cum SMARTMULTIPHASE - two unique technology products that allow the planning team provide end to end solutions that clearly answered the following key questions: Will each of the wells produce sand?; when and how much sand will be produced?; How can the sand production be prevented or reduced without compromising fluid production?; How are the sand producers and  the multiphase transportation managed as well as enhance production? 
The case study has detailed out the risk assessment steps that are an essential process to minimise the impact of sand production in deepwater/subsea environment. Results from the example case study in this work confirm that log based data and corresponding over and above core data provide the best approach to detailed reservoir characterization defined by reservoir quality index (RQI) and flow zone indicator(FZI) required for sand production rate prediction  and transport analysis. 
The paper ends with how charging the reservoir with water injection can be an effective sand control method by extending the sand failure envelop and extensively prolong the onset of sand production.|",""

Nigeria has abundant hydrocarbon reserves. This work is aimed at reviewing the production profile of an existing Well-Y in Niger-Delta and simulating the process using Petroleum Experts IPM 7.0 software (precisely MBAL) with Microsoft office excel 2007. For the case study, the pressure, PVT and production data at Niger-Delta are used. From the production history table, the reservoir pressure is continuously above the bubble point pressure, 2200 psig. The producing Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) is estimated to be the solution GOR, 500 SCF/STB. Hence, the data is consistent with the PVT, since there is no free gas. Based on the response of the Campbell plot, the presence of an aquifer as a source of energy is very likely. Therefore Hurst-van Everdingen-Modified model is used as the aquifer model. The energy plot shows that the dominant drive mechanism is the water drive. From the decline curve analysis, it is observed that the decline curve type is hyperbolic with the smallest standard deviation of 0.0200079 STB/day and exponent of 1.24149. The results demonstrate that the approach is suitable for decline curve fitting and offers a new insight in decline curve analysis in the presence of unusual observations. This study is useful for the unconventional fields. It is deduced that the thickness of the reservoir is high enough and the point of perforation is far from the Oil-water Contact (OWC) to the extent that the water produced is negligible compare to the oil production. Hence, water encroachment is not considered for the economic limit. The economic limit is estimated to be 191.60bbl/day theoretically but in practical sense, no company in Nigeria would produce at that rate. Based on the prediction plot, it is recommended that the production should continue till at least 01/01/2015 because the reservoir pressure is still sufficiently high.|","Document Type

Geomechanics data are usually dependent on log data and reservoir rocks often deforms due to depletion in the life of a field. These changes occur as a result of changes in the stress on such rocks which are imposed by drilling, production and injection activities and these changes can be unfavourable to the operators when drilling new wells in the same field. Thus, these changes have to be accurately predicted and mitigated (if undesirable).  In this study, the accuracy of these vital geomechanical parameters obtained through sonic and gamma ray logs were compared and a correlation between both was established. Comparison was also made with respect to key indices including cost, safety, ease of acquisition etc. Only Unconfined Compressive Stress (UCS) as a geomechanical parameter was evaluated using several logging methods. The correlation coefficient range of 0.993 to 1 for various well logs analysed from the unconfined compressive stress obtained from the Sonic and Gamma ray logs. This would prove very useful especially for the marginal field operators in Nigeria and mature fields that do not have sonic logs as it would enable a more accurate derivation of geomechanical properties and the accruing benefits of a geomechanical analysis study.  The nagging limitation of the Petrophysical log approach is the accuracy of the logs as spurious correlations were noticed from defective logs.|",""

Sand particles are usually produced with oil, gas and water from the reservoir, constituting several operational challenges. Presence of sand in the production stream can cause erosion of upstream facilities and  even more commonly  clogging of flowlines and accumulation in production vessels; reducing residence time and thereby performance of separator internals. Operators have experienced expensive plant shut downs due to excessive sand production and hence demand for highly efficient, robust and compact solution for upstream sand removal from production streams. 
This paper presents a recent advancement in the design of compact sand removal equipments, for applications in subsea separation systems, offshore topsides and onshore process plants. The FMC Technologies inline desander technology is based on an innovative cyclonic separation principle, utilizing a smart stationary swirl element to develop an enhanced separation force. 
The desander design is governed by mechanistic models which describe the dynamics of sand particles dispersed in a radial flow field. Produced sand particles are separated from process stream by virtue of their inertia, and radial acceleration developed within the motion field. They are extracted as concentrated slurry through the reject outlet of the desander. The unique geometry of the desander and its internal design enables development of a low pressure core inside it, which initiates a reversed flow of the clean separated fluid into an underflow outlet.  As part of the development process of the inline desander, CFD simulation studies were also carried out to study the flow patterns developed in the desander and model the trajectory of the sand particles inside it. 
Extensive technical information about the technology development process of the compact desander is discussed in this paper; with reference to qualification tests and R&D reports. Some of its successful applications in challenging situations and advanced production facilities are also discussed.|","Sand production,  Inline desanding technology"

It has been globally estimated to cost the drilling industry more than $1billion annually in rig time, materials and other financial resources. Lost circulation is the total or partial loss of drilling fluids or cement slurries into highly permeable zones, cavernous formations, or natural/induced fractures during drilling or cementing operations. Lost circulation usually occurs when the hydrostatic head pressure of the column of drilling fluid exceeds the formation pressure. |This expensive problem is typically minimized or prevented by blending additives into the mud or cement system.

The loss in circulation was believed to be caused by natural fracture systems and high permeability within the zones to be cemented. The additive was first tested in the laboratory and determined to be efficient at countering the type of losses expected, and then was used in the field. |This paper will focus on the laboratory testing and the field application of the monofilament polypropylene fiber in two Niger Delta wells.

In planning or upfront engineering of well XYZ, it was found that the geology and structure was complex with multiple sheets of over thrust faults and highly dipping beds. Some of the faults were associated with highly laminated shale intervals which was one of the major challenge recorded while drilling previous wells. Therefore, a comprehensive study was performed using several offset well data to predict instability across the three depleted sands (W4009, W5000 and W5001) that posses major challenges while drilling four previous wells.  Proactive and analytical tasks were undertaken to circumvent anticipated drilling problems while drilling well XYZ in Niger Delta (some of this drilling problems ranges from major tight spots to stuck strings due to sub-optimal geomechanical evaluations). Additionally, a fault stability analysis was carried on, to ascertain the integrity of the traversed fault zones within the base of W5001 sand. In-view of wellbore and fault stability analysis, and considering offset wells drilling events, a drilling strategy was mapped taking into consideration all the risks, mitigations, and prevention of possible drilling problems with the best mudweight and trajectory design recommendation. Hence, maintaining a stable wellbore and considering the implication of in-situ stress variation, a mechanical earth model (MEM) was developed to handle all the geomechanical issues that might pose during drilling, POOH, casing running and cementing of recent XYZ well. In accessing the dangers posed while drilling through previous faulted depleted sand intervals, estimation of critical parameters that has to do with shear strength of the fault, ROP, hydraulics, pore pressures and insitu stresses at current conditions were modeled.  For this reason, the faults were typically assumed as open faults during the fault stability analysis as being done by (Barton and Zoback 2000) in their previous studies. 
Finally, in maintaining stability while drilling through these sands, four different tracking procedures were taken into consideration to enhance integrity while drilling, POOH, casing running and cementing. This includes; Track 1  building a 3D mechanical earth model/fault reactivation advisor, Track 2  accessing the frictional interplay and shear strength criteria for the sands, Track 3  Pore pressure estimation within the healed/open faults and depleted intervals in the field,  and Track 4  safe mudweight window/wellbore stability identification. 
Putting all these scenarios together helps in drilling well XYZ Niger Delta safer compared to previous wells earlier drilled within the same foothills, this helps in minimizes drilling challenges and major NPTs posed by wellbore instability.|",""

Borehole instabilities during drilling are more common in shale formations than in most other rock formations. The assessment of in-situ stress and analysis of borehole failure due to instability and weak bedding planes represents one of the most critical factors when evaluating borehole stability that causes borehole failure. Significant amount of research have been done in this area which resulted in various mathematical models about the issue of borehole failure, stability and plane of weakness due to bedding. So far, unified decision about the plane of weakness and failure of borehole on shale is yet to be fully realized by the industry, the most common of these losses are: widening of the well, washouts, stuck pipes, cavings, and deformation of the casing, amongst others. This work highlights the effect of shale bedding plane failure on wellbore stability and the angle of attack for stable drilling conditions in weak bedding planes by developing a robust tool to account for the criterion/conditions for identifying and drilling weak bedding planes , the rock strength for weak bedding planes (Uniaxial Compressive Strength UCS), minimum mud pressure to prevent shear failure & wellbore slip or slip shear failure in weak bedding planes and suitable attack angle to the bedding planes was also developed. 
The proposed tool has increased drilling efficiency and has been validated with field data. The advantage of this process is reduction in drilling difficulties and non productive time (NPT) in field operations in the Niger Delta where well construction targeting deeper horizons are proving to be a challenge. The new rock strength for weak bedding planes (UCS) helps to predict the minimum mud pressure to prevent shear failure & wellbore slip or slip shear failure in weak bedding planes having determined the best angle to place the well (angle of attack).|",""

The use of quantitative techniques in the evaluation of pore and fracture pressures across entire well path plays an important role in successful well delivery. The ability to correctly predict geo-pressures before drilling and manage them during drilling is a critical success factor to safe drilling of wells and cost reduction especially in deepwater environments. 
Compressional velocities have been used to provide indirect estimate of pressures prior to drilling; the method is well established Rodney Littleton et al, (74487). Vertical effective stress-Compressional velocity models in offset wells when fitted with empirical models can be applied to calibrated seismic velocities in prospect well locations to predict pore pressures. The accuracy of this method however depends on factors not limited to geology, compaction trend, seismic anisotropy, consistent velocity picking/gridding, input to gathers, over pressure prediction, etc. To raise the confidence level in the seismic based prediction, a simple yet pragmatic methodology has being used to demonstrate how combining velocity based pressures with pressure cell modeling can yield formation pressures across entire well paths with much higher degree of certainty. 
This work therefore discusses a study done on a deep water Nigeria field; where Seismic velocities have been used to predict pore pressures. The outcome was combined with pressure cell based methodology (standard method for pore pressure prediction in sands) to reduce the inherent uncertainties in sand pore pressure predictions. The results shared in this paper have already been used in effective design of several deep water wells in offshore Nigeria.|",""

A major global oil and gas producer has recently embarked on decommissioning of temporarily abandoned wells onshore, Nigeria. This was largely informed by a drive to ensure commitment to safeguarding of people and the environment and to ensure industry regulatory compliance/best practice. In addition in some cases human habitation has since encroached around these wells; most of which were drilled over 30 years ago and have since outlived their useful life. 
The decommissioning entailed total removal of both surface and sub-surface well equipment, installing permanent barriers to effectively isolate fresh water reservoirs from hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs in an environmentally safe manner, and subsequently restore the surface location, as close as possible, to its original state. Therefore, traditionally a conventional work-over rig would have been required. 
However, after an in-depth analysis technical, economic and safety- the producer chose a combination of the Hydraulic Workover Unit (HWU) and the Casing Jack Dual Stage Work Platform (CJ-DSWP) over the conventional workover rig. The HWU3 and CJ-DSWP4 was provided by Tecon Oil Services, an indigenous services company. The HWU and CJ-DSWP are compact hydraulic units with very small foot print; HWU rigged up directly on the wellhead2, is used to POOH (pull out of hole) the tubing strings and to secure/plug the well, CJ-DSWP deploys internal pressure pipe cutter to cut the casing, safely pull the casing to surface and cut them to shorter lengths for easy handling. 
The combination of the HWU and CJ-DSWP has safely decommissioned over 4wells as at December 2013 and also brings a huge cost saving compared to conventional workover rig.

Wellbore instability presents serious challenges to drilling activities, worldwide. It also has its effect when the wellbore is in production mode. Wellbore instability can be one of the greatest pre-conditions for Non-Productive Time (NPT) during drilling operations, if not anticipated and planned against accordingly. 
The principal stresses in the earths crust are vertical and horizontal in direction. Our wells are not always exactly vertical or horizontal, and it is the stresses parallel to and perpendicular to the well path that we are most interested in. The knowledge of these principal stresses will help plan a stable wellbore. 
Some of the factors that affect wellbore stability include, rock strength, mud weight, temperature fluctuations, wellbore geometry, drillstring vibration, stress and strength anisotropy, drilling fluid filtrate invasion, well path orientation and inclination. All these, must be scrutinized and ensured that they in no way affect the safe and efficient delivery of the well. In summary it must be ensured that the total stress redistribution down the subsurface is equal to the summation of the radial stress and hoop stress. 
Wellbore instability can result in serious operational problems like borehole collapse, lost circulation, stuck pipe etc, which are undesirable and have dire financial implications. It is therefore extremely important that drilling engineers anticipate this problem during planning and well design and introduce measures to curb it.  
This paper discusses the causes of wellbore instability, underscores the importance of geomechanical analysis as a preventive measure, reviews the various wellbore stability models currently applied in the industry, and presents a well design guideline on how to plan against wellbore instability problems. |","Document Type

With the advent of the multicore central-processing unit (CPU), todays commodity PC clusters are effectively a collection of interconnected parallel computers, each with multiple multicore CPUs and large shared random access memory (RAM), connected together by means of high-speed networks. Each computer, referred to as a compute node, is a powerful parallel computer on its own. Each compute node can be equipped further with acceleration devices such as the general-purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to further speed up computational-intensive portions of the simulator. Reservoir-simulation methods that can exploit this heterogeneous hardware system can be used to solve very-large-scale reservoir-simulation models and run significantly faster than conventional simulators. Because typical PC clusters are essentially distributed share-memory computers, this suggests that the use of mixed-paradigm parallelism (distributed-shared memory), such as message-passing interface and open multiprocessing (MPI-OMP), should work well for computational efficiency and memory use. In this work, we compare and contrast the single-paradigm programming models, MPI or OMP, with the mixed paradigm, MPI-OMP, programming model for a class of solver method that is suited for the different modes of parallelism. The results showed that the distributed memory (MPI-only) model has superior multicompute-node scalability, whereas the shared memory (OMP-only) model has superior parallel performance on a single compute node. The mixed MPI-OMP model and OMP-only model are more memory-efficient for the multicore architecture than the MPI-only model because they require less or no halo-cell storage for the subdomains. To exploit the fine-grain shared memory parallelism available on the GPGPU architecture, algorithms should be suited to the single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) parallelism, and any recursive operations are serialized. In addition, solver methods and data store need to be reworked to coalesce memory access and to avoid shared memory-bank conflicts. Wherever possible, the cost of data transfer through the peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) bus between the CPU and GPGPU needs to be hidden by means of asynchronous communication. We applied multiparadigm parallelism to accelerate compositional reservoir simulation on a GPGPU-equipped PC cluster. On a dual-CPU-dual-GPU compute node, the parallelized solver running on the dual-GPGPU Fermi M2090Q achieved up to 19 times speedup over the serial CPU (1-core) results and up to 3.7 times speedup over the parallel dual-CPU X5675 results in mixed MPI+OMP paradigm for a 1.728-million-cell compositional model. Parallel performance shows a strong dependency on the subdomain sizes. Parallel CPU solve has a higher performance for smaller domain partitions, whereas GPGPU solve requires large partitions for each chip for good parallel performance. This is related to improved cache efficiency on the CPU for small subdomains and the loading requirement for massive parallelism on the GPGPU. Therefore, for a given model, the multinode parallel performance decreases for the GPGPU relative to the CPU as the model is further subdivided into smaller subdomains to be solved on more compute nodes. To illustrate this, a modified SPE5 (Killough and Kossak 1987) model with various grid dimensions was run to generate comparative results. Parallel performances for three field compositional models of various sizes and dimensions are included to further elucidate and contrast CPU-GPGPU single-node and multiple-node performances. A PC cluster with the Tesla M2070Q GPGPU and the 6-core Xeon X5675 Westmere was used to produce the majority of the reported results. Another PC cluster with the Tesla M2090Q GPGPU was available for some cases, and the results are reported for the modified SPE5 (Killough and Kossack 1987) problems for comparison.|","Linear Solver, Parallel Acceleration, Reservoir Simulation, Multi-Paradigm , Heterogeneous Computing"

Horizontal wells that intersect multistage transverse fractures created by low-viscosity fracturing fluid with low proppant loadings are the key to revitalizing production from the Mississippian Barnett shale in the Fort Worth basin in Texas. However, direct laboratory measurements of both natural- and induced-fracture conductivities under realistic experimental-design conditions are needed for reliable well-performance analysis and fracture-design optimization. In this work, a series of experiments was conducted to measure the conductivity of unpropped natural fractures, propped natural fractures, unpropped induced fractures and propped induced fractures with a modified American Petroleum Institute (API) conductivity cell at room temperature. Fractures were induced along the natural bedding planes, preserving fracture-surface asperities. Natural-fracture infill was taken into consideration during conductivity measurements. Proppants of various sizes were placed manually between rough fracture surfaces at realistic concentrations. The two sides of the rough fractures either were aligned or were displaced with a 0.1-in. offset. After pressure testing on the system integrity, nitrogen was flowed through the proppant pack or unpropped fracture to measure the conductivity. Results from 88 experiments show that the conductivity of hydraulic fractures in shale can be measured accurately in a laboratory with appropriate experimental procedures and good control on experimental errors. It is proved that unpropped, aligned fractures can provide a conductive path after removal of free particles and debris because of the brittleness and lamination of shale. Moreover, poorly cemented natural fractures and unpropped displaced fractures can create conductivities up to 0.5 md-ft at formation-closure stress, which is one to two orders of magnitude greater than the conductivity provided by cemented natural fractures and unpropped aligned fractures. This study shows that propped-fracture conductivity increases with larger proppant size and higher proppant concentration. Longer-term fracture-conductivity measurements indicate that, within 20 hours, the fracture conductivity could be reduced by as much as 20%.|","Barnett Shale, fracture conductivity"

Produced-water reinjection (PWRI) is an important strategy for deriving value from waste water (Abou Sayed et al. 2005), but its implementation can face challenges related to injectivity and safety issues. Reinjection in fracturing regime is often the only option to guarantee the sustainability of injectivity (Detienne et al. 2005), but it can present some risks to be anticipated early in the design phase. The first objective of a PWRI-design study is to supply water-quality specifications to petroleum architects (in terms of solid and oil contents) to allow for the design of water-treatment facilities. The second objective is to supply injection-pressure specifications for the design of injection pumps and an injection network. These specifications must allow for sustaining well injectivity over the life of the field, while preventing any risk of caprock failure. The water-quality specification is of prime importance because a maximum of contaminant injection is sought to minimize the cost related to water treatment, but at the same time, it must prevent any injectivity loss or excessive increase of pressure beyond which fracture confinement is no longer possible. Water quality and injection pressure are thus linked to each other. They are deduced by simulation on a case-by-case basis. The modeling approach used by Total was presented in previous publications (Detienne et al. 1998, 2005; Ochi et al. 2007). The objective of this paper is to detail the manner in which the two parameters are deduced when uncertainties on input data are considered. Indeed, a workflow for uncertainty management based on experimental design and Monte Carlo theories was implemented to combine the simultaneous effect of a relatively large number of uncertain parameters, each of them being characterized by its own probabilistic distribution. Two-thousand simulations were run systematically, and water-quality and injection-pressure specifications were supplied with a probabilistic value (P10, P50, and P90). Application of this approach to real-design examples is detailed and discussed in this paper.|","water quality and injection pressure specifications, produced water reinjection, design, modeling, uncertainties assessment"

DHD uses a diffuse interface description for fluid-fluid interfaces that is implemented via the density-functional approach applied to the hydrodynamics of complex systems. In addition to mass and momentum balance, a full thermodynamic energy balance is considered. Hence the simulator inherently takes into consideration multiphase and multicomponent behavior and is suited for nonisothermal cases which allows the handling of many physical phenomena including multiphase compositional flows with phase transitions, different types of fluid-rock and fluid-fluid interactions (e.g. wettability and adsorption), and various types of fluid rheology. |The DHD simulator is a research prototype optimized for high-performance computing (HPC) and applied to porous media systems. We demonstrate the utility of DHD to simulate two-phase flow displacement ranging from the classical Lenormand pore-scale displacement events and Roofs snap-off criteria to more complex cooperative phenomena like capillary desaturation and relative permeability. The simulation results are benchmarked against experimental data in coreflooding, a 2D micromodel, and synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography experiments and provide good agreement.|","Document Type

Here, pore-scale displacement events in porous rock were imaged in situ in real time in natural rock under dynamic flow conditions, where the pressure gradient and the viscocapillary balance were maintained during scanning. Two elementary processes, Haines jumps in drainage and snap-off in imbibition, were studied in detail for sintered glass, sandstone, and carbonate rock. We found that most Haines jump events do not displace the wetting phase pore-by-pore, but typically involve 10 to 20 individual pores and that filling events are cooperative.

The filtration of solids in the injection water in a frac pack is the primary factor controlling the injectivity decline in frac-packed water-injection-well completions. The injectivity may decline rapidly or much more slowly, depending on the degree of frac-pack filtration. The widening and lengthening of frac packs and the associated loss of sand control are affected also. However, there are no experimental data available for the filtration coefficient at high velocities that are typical in frac packs. In this research, the filtration coefficients were measured experimentally in high-velocity flows encountered in frac packs. The solid concentrations and pressure drops across proppant-pack sections were measured correlated with earlier filtration theory and permeability-decline models. The filtration coefficients were measured at various flow rates and for different proppant sizes. Our experiments show that at high fluid velocities, the filtration coefficient is significantly lower than that estimated from prior correlations that are based on low-velocity filtration. We have developed new empirical correlations for filtration coefficients at high flow rates in frac packs. The improved filtration coefficients were used as the primary input into a well-injectivity model. The proper estimation of the filtration enabled us to more accurately analyze the impact of injection rates and proppant selection on injector performance (i.e., predict long-term injection-well behavior. The effect of particle filtration in the frac pack, and its effect on injector performance, was captured accurately for the first time. The newly presented empirical correlations coupled with a model for frac-pack growth in the injection well allowed us to estimate accurately the fracture dimensions and the long-term water injectivity of frac-packed injectors. These results can be used for frac-pack design, proppant selection, and specification of injection-water quality.|","water injection, injectivity, frac-pack, sand control, filtration"

In spite of the fact that multistage hydraulic fracturing from horizontalwells is the fastest growing and arguably the most economically importantapplication for well stimulation, numerous fundamental questions remain thatare relevant to determining how long to make each isolated interval and howmany perforation clusters to place within each interval. This paper providesnew insights into this problem by predicting how many hydraulic fractures canbe expected to grow simultaneously from multiple perforation clusterspressurized by a single injection stage. These predictions are obtained from acoupled mathematical model that includes the contributions of fluid flow, rockbreakage, and pressure loss through the perforations to the total powerrequirements for the growth of arrays of multiple hydraulic fractures. Fortypical shale gas stimulations, radial hydraulic fractures are predicted togrow from all perforation clusters, with progressive reduction in the number ofhydraulic fractures, thereby maintaining a ratio of the radius to the spacingthat is a small amount less than unity. If the hydraulic fractures arecontained to a height H, then multiple Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) -likehydraulic fractures are predicted to continue growing, with the length of eachhydraulic fracture increasing throughout the injection and with a spacing thatis approximately 1.5 H when perforation losses are strong andapproximately 2.5 H when perforation losses are negligible. Thesegeometric predictions are consistent with previously published observationsbased on microseismicity associated with stimulations in the Barnett Shale.|","Document Type

The basic question then arises: Are the simulation tools that we have suitable for the job? Can they explain, and ultimately forecast, the contribution to flow from natural or hydraulically induced fractures? Ultimately, we need to be confident that the results from such models are sufficiently reliable for decision-making purposes. As Alexandre Emerick stated in JPT (April 2014), The goal is to generate models for production forecasting aiding the decision-making process involved in the development and management of petroleum reservoirs. |The ability to model this increasingly important asset class is one of the primary issues facing reservoir and simulation engineers today. Our existing arsenal of simulation tools is certainly time-tested for conventional assets, but can they deliver reliable forecasts for this emergent class? Recent literature is rich with relevant studies ranging from fundamental laboratory experiments to entirely empirical, data-driven, approaches for predictive reservoir management. These articles raise numerous questions, including the possible oversimplification of a complex problem, the very nature of the production mechanisms, and the role played by any pre-existing discrete fracture networks. |Additional concerns relating to accuracy and reliability of the underlying data used to populate such models have also been raised. Keeping an open mind on this topic is, I feel, appropriate. One needs to balance the very real need for such predictive tools today with the recognition that future evidence may disrupt certain preconceptions. To this end, four articles have been selected that span a spectrum of ideas. One considers practical applications and solutions, while another covers the emerging technique of molecular simulation. Another eloquently probes various notions in our current state of understanding of shale assets and examines issues in interpreting the forecasts furnished by our simulation models. The fourth article demonstrates some creative thinking by representing a planar fracture by use of a proxy comprising a coupled flowing network model, a concept that may prove flexible and warrants further investigation. Conventional modeling tools used to predict flow in tight, fractured shales (e.g., dual-porosity models, local grid refinements, tartan grids) may, indeed, provide reliable forecasting. Analytic and data-driven approaches are also acceptable in some circumstances. However, as our knowledge in exploiting these assets deepens with new theory, laboratory experiments, and field and operational experience, we should be prepared to reconsider some of todays axioms in the future.|",""

The block is in Sichuan province, and the target zone is Longmaxi hot shale, a Silurian formation. Its matrix permeability is extremely low (100 to 300 nanodarcies), but it is rich in natural fractures. Hydraulic fracturing has been shown to be critical to enhancing production. A collaborative approach was applied to the completion of the shale gas wells during appraisal. |Introduction |Most of Chinas proved shale-gas resources are in the Sichuan, Tarim, and Ordos basins. Chinas technically recoverable shale-gas resources are estimated at 1,275 Tcf. The operator jointly appraised a shale-gas block in Sichuan with PetroChina. The project team needed to make several determinations in the early phase of the project, such as whether there is sufficient gas in the shale formation and whether the gas can be extracted at a high-enough (commercial) rate. From the production technologists perspective, the technical objectives of the early wells included the following: |Test the ability of the Longmaxi hot-shale interval to be fractured under high formation pressure. |Establish baseline fracture designs for the Longmaxi hotshale interval, at greater than 3500-m true vertical depth (TVD), and systematically evaluate the design parameters. |Establish an effective multidisciplinary workflow. |Gather fracture-stimulation-performance data and subsurface-pressure information. |Determine the productivity of the gas from the appraisal wells to prove the presence of a shale-gas play. |The joint-appraisal phase began in November 2010. While planning the drilling of deep wells to evaluate the Longmaxi formation, data were obtained from several shallow wells at a location close to the surface. Extensive laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate the geochemical properties of the rock. In addition, some rock-mechanics properties were measured. The drilling of the first well (Well A) began in December 2010, and hydraulic fracturing began once the well reached designed depth. To date, five wells have been drilled; two are vertical, and three are horizontal.|","Document Type

These wellbores have historically variable quality and quantity of cement that will have undergone ranging degrees of degradation. Wellbore performance in a single wellbore is dependent on the wellbore events (i.e. pressure and temperature changes) that occur within the life of the wellbore (Fourmaintraux et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2007). 
There is significant uncertainty surrounding the integrity of existing wellbores due to a lack of data. Successful implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) will depend on solving the small-scale leakage problem associated with localized flow along wellbores. Our knowledge of oil wellbore performance under different life stages of a well is still weak. Consequently, each wellbore is unique and general conclusions about well integrity are difficult to ascertain from analyzing only a single well. Each wellbore is considered as a risk and robust tools are needed to allow for the assessment of the performance for wellbores and investigate wellbore leakage mechanism. 
In this paper, a full lifecycle methodology is proposed to assess wellbore integrity as a measure of the risk of leakage. The methodology identifies the key elements to model the wellbore element and incorporates the use of a statistical approach to better understand the uncertainty in the risk estimation and interaction between various parameters controlling the model.|","Integrity, Life Cycle, Leakage, CO2, Wellbore"

In SAGD, steam is injected into an upper horizontal injection well, while emulsified bitumen and condensed water are produced from the lower horizontal production well. Produced water is treated and recycled to generate steam. Water management is a key factor in the operation of the whole process. Reservoir water losses are an essential part of the physics of the subsurface process with enormous implications for the water management. Prediction of reservoir water losses is critical to the design and operation of SAGD wells and facilities. For the purpose of forecasting water losses, three different approaches have been taken. The obvious inherent assumption in these methods is the ability of cold water to move through cold reservoir from higher pressure to lower pressure areas. This paper presents three methods to forecast reservoir water losses: the empirical, the analytical and the numerical simulation methods. These different approaches are complementary and incrementally complex allowing for flexibility (depending on time demand to create the forecast and required precision of the results).

Reservoirs like oil sands are shallow unconsolidated formations and stress dependent. During steam-assisted drainage (SAGD) the effective stress increases as results of either increasing in temperature or pore pressure. Rock properties for instance permeability will be induced by this change to influence therefore reservoir calculations. 
To understand the behavior of stress-strain in unconsolidated reservoir during a SAGD, a series of drained triaxial compression tests were performed to study the shear-induced changes in absolute permeability at low stress conditions. The experimental program included stress-strain tests under two different paths: isotropic unloading and increasing of mean stress was followed by permeability tests at each levels of strain and at different confining effective stresses.  
Results from this study showed a substantial increase of absolute permeability in the lower case of 50 kPa of effective confining stress. This gain was up to 88%. In the higher level of effective confining stress, however, there was a decrease of absolute permeability. 
The aim of this project was to provide an empirical correlation linking the absolute permeability to effective confining stress and volumetric stain so that the behavior of absolute permeability at different overburden depths will be understood.|","Geomechanics, SAGD, Permeability, Folw in Porous media"

The use of this type of survey in history matching SAGD simulation models has also grown significantly, allowing engineers to match not only the volumes, temperatures and pressures, but the shapes of the steam chambers as well. In the authors experience, however, before 4D Seismic surveys can be used confidently to history match the steam chamber shapes, we need to understand what 4D seismic represents. Prior proposals suggest steam or gas chamber volume, stress change volume or temperature change volume. To investigate this, the current study examines the impact of various physical property changes impacting the surveys (in particular, geomechanical effects), so that the appropriate 4D seismic history matching criterion are established. 
To determine how the above factors impact the 4D seismic surveys, this study investigates the relative impact of various property changes that occur in-situ during the SAGD process, with the intent to determine what changes have the biggest impact on seismic velocity. A number of SAGD simulation runs were conducted using typical oil sands geology with fully coupled geomechanics. Afterwards, the change in pressure-wave velocity and shear-wave velocity at the simulation grid blocks at various times during the simulation was calculated.

Nexens Long Lake and Suncors Firebag SAGD projects reported existence of intersecting lean zones that behave as thief zones, causing the operating pressure to be lower than the desirable value to reduce heat loss in the lean zones. Given a high steam-oil ratio, long and continuous lean zones located vertically above or near a wellbore pose a challenge. Log analyses and core experiments reveal that the distribution of lean zones is close to being periodic in the upper and middle parts of the McMurray Formation in Athabasca. A simulation model with periodic lean zones is established to analyze the effects of these lean zones on SAGD performance. 
We investigate the effects of vertical distribution, horizontal spacing and sizes, and spatial relationship with SAGD horizontal wells. We classify the locations of lean zones as above an injector (AI), between an injector and a producer (BIP), and below a producer (BP). For each location, we assign different spacing for neighboring lean zones of different sizes. A lean zone must reach a critical size before this area can act as a thief zone, which is most significant in AI and BIP situations. In general, BP cases are hardly influenced by lean zones. We further control the vertical distribution of these zones using a triangular periodic function that depends on layer depth and connate water saturation. Changing the period of the dominant function yields different kinds of lean zone distribution patterns; we run simulations for each pattern. Results show that lean zones with small periods have significant effects on SAGD performance. We vary the injection pressure to obtain the highest net present value (NPV) based on the fact that more steam is released through the lean zones at a higher pressure.|","SAGD, lean zone, thermal simulation"

Simple homogeneous models are suitable for understanding basic reservoir engineering parameters and for simple sensitivity analyses. However in real reservoirs with heterogeneities such as at Nexen Long Lake, a comprehensive geomodel which includes all the available geology and geophysics knowledge is necessary in order to extract the greatest value from the simulation efforts. 
A geomodel is representative of the real reservoir if simulation of the geomodel is able to reproduce the production history of the reservoir (history matching). For a typical SAGD pad, the parameters to be matched include the injection and production rates, downhole injection pressures, and pressure and temperature of observation wells. 
Based on our experience, for this process to be effective and reasonably timely a team consisting of the geologist, geophysicist, geomodeler, production and reservoir / simulation engineer must work interactively and in an iterative, trial and error fashion. 
The geomodelling part is presented in Part 1(10), of this paper and in Part 2 the simulation results are reviewed. The simulation process can be divided into three main parts - history matching, sensitivity analysis and forecasting. Once the history matching part is done, the geomodel is ready to be used for the other two parts. 
High water saturation zones, also referred to as lean zones and top water, play an important role in different stages of a SAGD project. A detailed strategy is necessary to deal with them and to optimize the production. Simulation results show that one needs to be able to increase the total fluid rate and solve the sub-cool limitations at the time of contact with these lean zones.

However full-field numerical simulations of multi-physics processes by any coupling strategies are technically impossible with current computer CPUs. Under these conditions, analytical methods can be used as approximate techniques instead of numerical simulators, as they are much faster and yet are useful tools for preliminary forecasting and sensitivity studies. In analytical models, inclusions of all flow variables impacts into geomechanics frameworks make the equations so complex and almost impossible to solve. This paper provides a flow-based domain decomposition workflow for performing different analytical coupling schemes in different reservoir compartments. 
Since the intensity and complexity of reservoir geomechanics vary over reservoir domain, one can divide the reservoir to some sub-domains and assess different geomechanical responses separately in each sub-domain.The presented analytical proxy, suggest decomposition of the whole domain in into two parts of heated zone and wetted zone, for rapid assessment of geomechanics. The heat flow equation was combined with mass and momentum convective transport equations to obtain an exact approach that correlates the saturation front of injected hot water to temperature front. The frontal velocities are dynamic interfaces for compartmentalization of the domain. In the heated zone , the total induced stresses, were considered due to both temperature and pressure increase, and in the wetted (saturated) zone beyond the temperature front , at each instance the total stress induced is only a function of pressure increase, and accordingly stress and strain induced are due to isotropic unloading. This technique provides a rapid estimate of geomechanical responses (stress and strain profile) in each part of the reservoir (near field and far field). 
A numerical model was built and implemented in CMG-STARS for steam-flood case to show the robustness and applicability range of the model. The results were analyzed for synthetic case single-domain model and the model sensitivity on some reservoir parameters were checked, and at the same time geomechanical responses were not neglected anywhere (near-filed and far field) in the reservoir.|","Thermal Recovery, Geomechanics, Domain Decomposition, Analytical proxy, Large Scale"

Part 1: Temperature Front Prediction","Irani, Mazda, Suncor Energy| Cokar, Marya, Suncor Energy","|Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is the preferred thermal recovery method used to recover bitumen from Athabasca deposits in Alberta, Canada.  In SAGD, steam injected into a horizontal injection well is forced into the reservoir, losing its latent heat when it comes into contact with the cold bitumen at the edge of a depletion chamber.  Heat energy is transferred from steam to reservoir, reducing the viscosity of the bitumen, which flows under gravity toward a horizontal production well. Conduction is the main heat transfer mechanism in early SAGD, and reservoir thermal conductivity is a key parameter in conductive heat transfer.  Conductive heat transfer occurs at a higher rate across reservoirs with higher thermal conductivity, which in turn affects the temperature profile ahead of the steam interface.  Consequently, a reservoir with higher thermal conductivity will result in higher reservoir heating rates, and higher oil production rates. When the oil sands reservoir undergoes a temperature change from reservoir temperature to steam chamber temperature the thermal conductivity decreases up to 25% (depending on the initial reservoir and steam temperature), which affects the temperature profile and conductive heating within the reservoir.  This study provides a modified Butlers model which includes a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity value. A simplified method is suggested using the thermal conductivity at average temperature of steam and reservoir will keep error under 1% for the range of SAGD applications. This novel approach is the first of its kind to incorporate a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity within the reservoir to a SAGD analytical model.|","thermal conductivity, heat transfer, Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage, conduction"

The injection pressure is typically above the reservoir fracture pressure to induce fractures, which can improve reservoir permeability and fluid mobility. Geomechanics and heterogeneities near a well significantly affect reservoir fracturing, particularly under thermal conditions. In addition, oversimplified descriptions of fracture geometry may fail to represent actual reservoir performance. Thus modeling near-well flow effects coupled with geomechanics is essential for detailed large-scale thermal simulations with fractures. Conventional methods have exhibited limitations in capturing interactions among wellbore/near-well flow, geomechanics, and fluid flow during CSS development. Therefore, flow/stress/near-well flow coupling under different fracture geometries is investigated in this study. 
A facies-controlled geostatistical model is first constructed for a Cold Lake reservoir to obtain more reliable results. A fully coupled model is further generated from this geological model. After local grids near wells are refined, we construct different fracture geometries by changing the fracture length and direction. In this study, uncertainty analyses on fracture geometry near the vertical wells are performed. The simulation results show that omitting geomechanics and wellbore modeling increases oil recovery. Moreover, oversimplified fracture geometry with simple planes overestimates an oil rate. Furthermore, fractures with complex geometries and geomechanics exhibit high conductivity and provides effective channels for steam and bitumen but at the same time, it may cause steam channeling and decrease the efficiency of steam injection.|","wellbore, CSS, near well flow, fracture"

The main focus is centred on the removal of heavy metals and hydrocarbon residues. Phytoremediation, the technique that utilizes a plants inherent ability to accumulate metals, is fast emerging as a relatively cheap and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional wastewater treatment methods. A corollary of this is an urgent need to identify plant species with the appropriate suite of characteristics for phytoremediation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the phytoremediation potentials of Limnocharis flava, Thalia geniculata and Typha latifolia using three serially connected horizontal sub-surface flow (HSF) constructed wetlands. Each wetland had only one of the three plant species but all were supplied with wastewater from a common source. From October 2010 to March 2011, the growth performance of the candidate plants was measured, and their accumulation and translocation rates of heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Hg) determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Mean removal efficiencies ranged from 40-80%, 48-54%, 44-54%, 18-32% and 8-38% respectively for Fe, Hg, Zn, Pb and Cu. The removal efficiencies of the species differed depending on the metal. L. Flava was most efficient (p<0.001) at removing Fe, Cu mostly removed by T. latifolia (p< 0.001) whilst T. geniculate appeared to be the best remover of lead (p< 0.021). Both T. geniculata and T. latifolia appeared to remove zinc better than L. flava (p<0.021), but there was no statistical difference in the removal rates of mercury by the plants. Similar trends were observed for the bioaccumulation factor, which increased substantially with time. The plants accumulated most of the metals in their roots.

Thermally induced deformation and fracturing in shale impacts on wellbore and caprock integrities. Most previous investigations focused on the mechanical properties of the clay shale. However, limited experimental work has been conducted to investigate the thermal response of clay shale under thermal operation conditions. 
In this research, the thermal response of clay shale under different confining pressure conditions is investigated. Laboratory confined and unconfined tests were conducted on Colorado Shale cores which were retrieved from the overburden shale formation above the oil sands reservoirs in Cold Lake area, Alberta, Canada. The shale cores were heated at different heating rates and were subjected to different pressure conditions. The thermally induced deformation and fracturing responses in shale have been captured by X-ray computed tomography scanning (CT scan).

A SAGD operation may create a high degree of deformation in the reservoir rock because of the stresses induced by pressure and temperature. This might yield to a failure of both the reservoir rock as well as the caprock. Thus, there is a need to understand the impact of various geomechanical and operational parameters on overall safety of a SAGD operation. 
In this paper, caprock failure during SAGD was modeled using a coupled simulator to integrate reservoir flow with geomechanical deformation. Representative Canadian oilsands properties were used for the simulation. Both shear and tensile failures were modeled and the surface heave/deformation was recorded. 
Sensitivity analyses and uncertainty assessments were performed to understand the effect of various geomechanical properties on caprock integrity and surface heave, including Youngs modulus, Poissons ratio and thermal pore pressure. At the same time, operating conditions such as well spacing and maximum injection pressure were also altered to see their effect on caprock integrity.

The well-known Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) takes advantage of the strong dependency of bitumen viscosity on temperature ranging from 10 to 250 °C. The latent heat of injected steam is released as the steam chamber develops and causes the bitumen to mobilize and drain under the effect of gravity toward the production well. Co-injection of solvent with steam (ES-SAGD) may help to reduce the oleic phase viscosity adjacent to chamber edge by offsetting the temperature reduction effect. 
While many researchers are currently tackling the optimal operational conditions from a fluid property point of view (pressure, solvent fraction, etc.), less attention was paid to the impact of heat transfer due to incorporation of geomechanics into occurring physics. Such simplifications in analyzing the real processes physics would result in neglecting of the convection flow of heat along with conduction. Considering the dramatic changes in temperature at the chamber edge, the induced thermal geomechanical responses would lead to a faster fluid movement. The fluid mobility at the edge of chamber would even increase more, mainly because of temperature-dependant heat capacity of water, changes in absolute and relative permeabilities, and possible wettability alteration.  If a multi-component solvent is used (ES-SAGD), the assessment of production performance would get more complicated due to the different condensation dynamics of light versus heavy components and the possible gas-blanket effect caused by the co-injected solvent. 
In this study, the geomechanical changes due to pressure and temperature effects were considered at the steam chamber, for both SAGD and ES-SAGD scenarios. The thermo-poro-elasticity concept, with elastic constitutive rock behaviour, was chosen for geomechanical study. The primary impacts of geomechanics on the physics of ES-SAGD were rock and fluid alterations, and changes in petrophysical properties (porosity and absolute permeability). Assuming a potential change in rock and fluid interaction due to geomechanics, the same analysis was conducted for a multi-component solvent with different condensation profiles. It was shown how the use of solvent will adversely affect the induced thermal geomechanics contribution. The findings of this paper can be used as a guideline for further experimental studies on the effect of geomechanics in thermal-based recovery processes.|","SAGD Mobile Edge, ES-SAGD, Thermal Recovery, Geomechanics, Rock Deformation"

These changes trigger the deformation and stress redistribution of the overburden strata, which could lead to containment breach of the caprock through shear or tensile failure. Isotropic models have commonly been used to assess caprock integrity. These models are believed to be deficient in capturing the anisotropic response of shale and mudstone, which has been well documented in applications other than SAGD caprock studies. 
We developed an iteratively coupled hydro-thermo-mechanical model to evaluate caprock integrity in SAGD reservoirs by coupling a geomechanical model (FLAC) and a thermal reservoir simulator (CMG STARS). We investigated the impact of SAGD operations on stress distribution in the caprock using an anisotropic model that we implemented in FLAC. We repeated the analysis by using the same tool and model, but with the assumption of isotropic shale, and compared the results. Incorporating anisotropy in the model showed an impact on the state of caprock stress and failure pressure of the caprock.

However, analysis of a number of successful SAGD projects, with operating histories of 10 years or more indicates that there is clear evidence that observed performance can deviate significantly from the performance predicted by the above concept. One particularly interesting set of observations shows a declining or unchanged SOR at the mature stage.  An examination of this SOR behavior and several other unexpected SAGD performance characteristics detected in the field are presented. 
It is proposed that the above field performance characteristics are consistent with the interpretation that the steam chamber does not rise to the top of the reservoir prior to expanding laterally.  In these cases oil production is achieved by two different mechanisms: one is expansion of the steam chamber and the other is drainage of oil from the layer above the steam chamber. A simulation method and the results of a number of history matching studies are presented to explain the oil and gas flow in the layer above the steam chamber and its contribution to observed SAGD performance.|","SAGD Process, Oil Drainage, Field Performance Characteristics"

Polymer flooding has often been depicted to be dominated by one mechanism:  water viscosification reduces the mobility ratio, and stabilizes the displacement front to increase oil recovery. Increasingly though the contribution of mechanisms other than water viscosification is becoming understood. This paper points out two novel insights into polymer flooding: (1) the intrinsic value of the polymer is likely being overestimated and (2) the practice of operating the polymer flood with incomplete voidage replacement may indeed be optimal.   The conversion of a conventional waterflood to a polymer flood entails significant injectivity reduction, up to 50% or more. The maintenance of complete voidage replacement (VRR = 1) would thus require an increase in the number of injectors, or a reduction of total production rate or both. As both interventions reduce the economic returns, most projects operate with incomplete voidage replacement (VRR < 1). We have previously reported that a VRR < 1 improves the waterflood response of heavy oil reservoirs.  Thus using the VRR = 1 waterflood as the comparison benchmark to the polymer response may overestimate the value of viscosification  the intrinsic value of the polymer. To quantify this, we have performed numerical simulations of polymer flooding for VRRs ranging from 0.4 to 1.4, deconvolving the relative contributions of the viscosification and VRR < 1 mechanisms.  We observe that a polymer flood operated with VRR > 1 (above the oil bubble point) underperforms a polymer flood with a VRR < 1 by as much as one third. We conclude that the intrinsic value of the polymer is overestimated.|","Mechanisms, Polymer, Mobility, EOR, VRR"

The PSD of the McMurray Formation sediments characterizes rock granulometry and is a fundamental indicator of sediments nature.  The size distribution of the component solid particles in the McMurray Formation sediments relates to their porosity, volume of water and bitumen contained within the pore space, and to depositional environment, including lithological association, stratigraphy, aerial distribution, and associated physical processes. 
Particle size distribution is known to be a significant factor for evaluating bitumen recovery from an oil sands mine. This is because presence of fines (evaluated by PSD analysis) affects the hot water separation process, processing plant recovery prediction and provides grade control. Presence of more fines translates into lower recovery from commercial oil sands processing. In this paper we investigate whether the particle size distribution should be also considered a critical parameter for evaluation and estimation of permeability of an oil sands reservoir. 
We show using the data from the Cenovus Energys Telephone Lake lease that there is a strong relationship between permeability and particle size distribution data. We also show that the information provided by the PSDs for permeability prediction is more significant than the one inferred from a simple porosity-permeability relationship. Subsequently, we comment on permeability modeling using particle size distribution data and list the techniques available for cleaning and modeling of multivariate PSDs.

Each experiment was imaged with time lapse X-ray CT. The first two experiments, conducted in a medical scanner with a resolution of 350 <U+03BC>m, suggested important features below the scale of spatial resolution. The last experiment, performed in a synchrotron beamline with a resolution of 4.3 <U+03BC>m, provided a view of oil/water interactions on the scale of individual pores. 
Conventional theory holds that waterflooding is unstable with respect to the development of fingers, which push the oil ahead of them. Sweep efficiency can be improved by increasing the water viscosity with polymer, which reduces the mobility ratio and stabilizes the front. Waterflooding has been applied successfully to heavy oil, but the detailed mechanisms of recovery are not well understood. Breakthrough of water occurs quickly at the producer; most oil production occurs at high water cuts over a long period of time. 
The most striking feature of the medical scans was the absence of distinct fingers of high water saturation. The only identifiable, compact front consisted of saturation changes of 20% or less. Moreover, breakthrough occurred long before the front reached the production end of the pack. More surprisingly, water saturation was observed to increase everywhere throughout each experiment. The inference was that fingering, if present, was occurring at a scale below that of the resolution. The synchrotron scans did not reveal the expected pore scale fingering, but instead showed evidence of water transport entirely in wetting films. Residual blobs of connate water were observed to grow throughout, but never linked up to form fully water-saturated paths. 
The mechanism of oil mobilization was also quite different from the traditional picture. There was no scale at which oil was pushed ahead of a water front. Instead, isolated droplets of immobile water swelled, fed by films of water on the grain surfaces. These results do not rule out an eventual transition to a more conventional picture; only a few pore volumes were injected. But the path to that state may be different from what is usually assumed.|","experiment, waterflood, pore scale, heavy oil, x-ray ct"

Previous works in the literature have partially addressed their effects on SAGD performance; however, a comprehensive and systematic investigation of the heterogeneous distribution (location, continuity, size, and proportions) of shale barriers and lean zones is still lacking. 
In this study, numerical simulations are used to model the SAGD process. Capillarity and relative permeability effects, which have been ignored in many previous simulation studies, are incorporated to model bypassed oil. A ranking scheme based on cumulative oil production and cumulative steam oil ratio is devised. A detailed sensitivity analysis is performed by varying the location, continuity, size, proportions, and saturation of these heterogeneous features. Lean zones and shale lens (imbedded in a region of degraded rock properties) with different thickness and degree of continuity are placed in areas located either above the injector, below the producer, or in between the well pair. It is noted that among numerous parameters that influence the ultimate recovery, remaining bypassed oil, chamber advancement, and heat loss, continuity and position of these features in relation to the well pair play a particularly crucial role. We subsequently employ neural network modeling for constructing data-driven models to identify and propose a set of input variables for correlating relevant parameters or measures, which are descriptive of the heterogeneity and properties of the shale barriers, to recovery and ranking results. 
This work provides a guideline for assessing the impacts of reservoir and saturation heterogeneities on SAGD performance. We identify a set of input variables and parameters that have significant impacts on the ensuing recovery response.

Previous studies have shown that hydraulic fracturing in unconsolidated or weakly consolidated sandstone reservoirs is highly influenced by the low shear strength of these materials and is quite different from competent rocks. As such, existing classical hydraulic fracture models are incapable of predicting the fracturing process of weak sandstone reservoirs. This paper presents a numerical tool to simulate hydraulic fracturing in oil sands and weak sandstone reservoirs. 
A smeared fracture approach is adopted in the simulation of tensile and shear fracturing in oil sands. The model incorporates various phenomena expected in hydraulic fracturing, including poroelasticity and plasticity, matrix flow, shear and tensile fracturing and concomitant permeability enhancement, saturation-dependent permeability, stress dependent stiffness and gradual degradation of oil sands due to dilatant shear deformation and strain localization. 
The results of the hydraulic fracturing simulation indicate that poroelasticity as well as shear fracturing can result in breakdown and propagation pressures larger than the maximum in-situ stress. Applying such pressures in fracturing operations can compromise the caprock integrity. It is found that at injection pressures below the vertical stress, saturation-dependent relative permeability and the development of shear fractures in the reservoir highly influence the injection response.|","Numerical Modeling, Hydraulic Fracturing, Smeared Fracture Approach, Oil Sands"

Bitumen at reservoir condition is immobile due to high viscosity and its saturation is typically large that limits the injectivity of a steam at in-situ condition. In a current industry practice, steam is circulated within injection and production wells. Operators keep the steam circulation till mobile bitumen breaks through the producer and communication is established between the injector and the producer. The start-up (or circulation) phase is ranging between three to several months. A variety of processes are used to minimize time of start-up phase such as: electro-magnetic (EM) heating either induction (medium frequency) or radio frequency (RF) ranges. Knowing the hot-zone size formed by steam circulation and benefit of simultaneous EM-heating techniques help better understand the start-up process and how to minimize the start-up duration. The aim of the present work is to introduce an analytical model to predict start-up duration for only steam circulation and also for with EM-heating.

In addition, significant reserves are left behind as stranded reserves, as well as reserves that are usually characterized with weak caprock integrity and without enough pay thickness for SAGD to be economically viable. This paper focuses on a new technology that involves creating several mechanically induced inclusions in a single well. The production process is similar to a single-well SAGD. This method is proposed to assist both more uniform steam injection and bitumen production processes. The current setup is developed for vertical well applications; however, upon successful planning, the next version will be employed for horizontal applications. 
The current system consists of a vertical well with multiple vertical inclusions, which are used for simultaneous steam injection and liquid production purposes. Steam is injected into the upper part of the formation, and the drained liquid is collected at the bottom of the inclusions. Unlike the conventional steam chamber geometry in SAGD processes, steam moves outward from the inclusion faces into the formation and tends to move laterally out and vertically upward over time. Simulation studies of the system show that the success of such a technique depends on the inclusion dimensions as well as injection rate and pressure. In this study, the effects of inclusion dimensions and steam properties on the performance of such a process are investigated. Reservoir simulations of realistic reservoir conditions show promising results in terms of cumulative steam oil ratio (CSOR) and production rate. Early peak oil production occurred at approximately 100 days from the startup, and the CSOR dropped to under 3 m3/m3 after 100 days. The optimum inclusion dimensions and the best injection scenario for different net pays at different depths and geological conditions are illustrated in the paper. |","Stranded Reserves, pore pressure relief, Inclusions"

Using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to measure surface deformation allows for a common measuring stick with no access issues. Currently surface deformation is measured using many alternative approaches, some of which are less economical and not feasible at the regional scale when compared to InSAR. Information collected from InSAR could be used to develop an informed planning mechanism. 
Space based SAR data from January 2009 to August 2011 was examined over a SAGD site in Alberta, Canada. The data was extracted from the satellite archives and advanced InSAR processing techniques were applied to measure the surface deformation over the site. 
The InSAR results show the extreme variability in the ground conditions that are to be expected in the region. The surface deformation was measured using a combination of corner reflectors and infrastructure targets. The highly variable ground conditions make monitoring of subtle deformation signals (2.5  5 cm/yr) difficult to measure without the use of installed targets. The challenges of InSAR monitoring without installed targets are addressed to emphasize the importance of on-site ground control points. 
Furthermore, the surface changes observed with the InSAR results are related to reservoir changes. Geomechanical simulation is dependent on many rock physics parameters and complex geological frameworks. History matching with InSAR observation provides enhanced prediction and estimation of reservoir growth, which can inform decisions related to reservoir performance and caprock integrity. 
This paper is a result of a collaboration between the Alberta Energy Regulator, MDA Geospatial Services Inc.

D., Consultant Inc.","|In Alberta, Canada, bitumen production by surface mining followed by ore-water slurry based extraction processes is approaching 2,000,000 bbl/d capacity. The Clark Hot Water Extraction process developed in the 1930s is used at all commercial plants which use caustic NaOH as an additive to boost bitumen recovery efficiency. Use of NaOH as an extraction process additive increases process water salinity, specifically Na+ concentration, promotes dispersion of silt and clay size particles which results in greater production of toxic mature fine tailings.  Increase in process water Na+ concentration detrimentally affects the performance of both bitumen extraction and tailings disposal processes.  Existing mature fine tailings inventory stored in tailings ponds is exceeding 900x106 m3 and is predicted to grow alarmingly faster by the completion of new plants and by an increase in the production capacity of the existing plants.  The Energy Resources Conservation Board of Alberta issued Directive 074 in February, 2009 urging oil sands plants to comply with a 50% reduction in mature fine tailings production.  Proposed policies by the oil industry in response to Directive 074 have shown short fallings; which suggests that development of novel bitumen extraction and tailings management processes are needed. 
To reduce the mature fine tailings inventory, we studied production of nonsegregating tailings by treating a blend of cyclone underflow and thickened cyclone overflow with CaO additive.  These tests were made using Albian Sands Muskeg River Mine tailings when the plant was operating at nonadditive and sodium citrate additive extraction modes and using Syncrude Canada Ltd.s Aurora Mine tailings.  Also, we studied the use of CaO as a bitumen extraction process additive replacing NaOH in the Clark Hot Water Extraction process; by which silt-clay size particles dispersion in the extraction process slurry is reduced and accumulation of Na+ in the process water is eliminated.  Use of CaO as an extraction additive is considered as a fundamental and a new process alteration by the oil sands operators.  Recently, to evaluate this new process the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) has requested NAIT-NARCOSS, an independent academic and industrial research laboratory, to perform a third party verification study for the use of CaO as a bitumen extraction process additive.  The NAIT-NARCOSS test results are completed and are highly encouraging, confirming that use of CaO as an extraction process additive reduces dispersion of silt and clay size particles in the extraction process slurry without harming bitumen recovery efficiency. It also improves process water chemistry by eliminating accumulation of Na+ in the process water.  It is concluded that a paradigm change is offered to the oil sands industry to reduce the adverse environmental impacts of oil sands plants in simple, cost effective and environmentally friendly manners; which is the simultaneous implementation of the use of CaO as additives in bitumen extraction and nonsegregating tailings production processes.|","bitumen extraction, nonsegregating tailings, clay dispersion, water chemistry"

As a result, operators have exploited more difficult reservoirs (e.g., deeper wells, remote areas, mature depleted fields, and heavy oil reservoirs). Traditional methods are not sufficient for producing heavy oil; therefore, over time, enhanced recovery methods have been researched and developed. 
In-situ combustion (ISC) is the oldest thermal-recovery technique. It has been used for more than nine decades for many successful projects. This method is basically the injection of an oxidizing gas (air- or oxygen-enriched air) to generate heat by burning a portion of resilient oil. Most of the oil is driven toward the producers using a combination of gasdrive, steam, and waterdrive. 
High temperatures and the presence of corrosive gases involved during the ISC process can present significant challenges during well isolation. 
Phosphate cement is a unique system capable of resisting corrosive attack, maintaining low permeability at high temperatures, and resisting the attack of carbonic acid. 
One of the primary challenges was developing a special phosphate cement slurry capable of setting at low temperatures to minimize the waiting on cement (WOC) as well as developing properties sufficient for resisting future stresses. A special sodium aluminate thixotropic additive was used for the first time to react chemically with the pH of this special cement system to develop a quick and high compressive strength. 
More than nine wells have been cemented with this system in Colombia with good results. These wells have been subjected to different stresses (production, steam injection, and ISC).

Oil sands hosting this bitumen were deposited and reworked by tidal and fluvial currents, resulting in heterogeneous sediment distributions comprising cross-stratified and massive sands, breccias, and low permeability sand- to mud-dominated inclined heterolithic stratification (IHS). Conventional reservoir characterization workflows suggest that reservoir permeability correlates most closely to volume of shale (vShale). One aspect of such workflows is derivation of an empirical correlation between permeability obtained from core analyses and calculated vSh from wireline logs. While there may be numerous direct measurements from core samples, uncertainty in oil sands reservoir permeability is known to result from preferential sampling of clean sands versus muddy IHS and from scale differences between core sample and well log resolution. This uncertainty is particularly significant in facies with permeability < 500 millidarcy. We integrated multi-scale exploration data from a producing McMurray Formation reservoir to demonstrate the impact of centimeter-scale reservoir architecture on permeability. The study uses high-resolution 3D models of the near-wellbore region to characterize observed variability in percentage, orientation and dimension of mud laminae, breccia clasts and trace fossils. We created multiple realizations to capture the variability in model simulation parameters. High-resolution models of several million cells were upscaled at the resolution of the vSh log using a flow simulation-based numerical method. Upscaling results are estimates of effective directional permeability (kx, ky, kz). The flow-based permeability results better define the interrelationship of permeability and vShale within a reservoir. Our results demonstrate a modeling workflow that provides more precise permeability estimates at wireline log resolution. This workflow has the potential to improve history matching in flow simulations and improvements in well placement and performance forecasting.|","Inclined Heterolithic Stratification, Vertical Permeability, Reservoir Characterization, McMurray Formation, Volume Shale"

In this study, we investi-gated the environmental impact of in-situ bitumen extraction by ISC, SAGD, SF, and HWI, experimentally. The original oil, water, and rock, produced oil and water, and spent rock samples originated from each recovery method were analyzed through Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, Inductive Coupled Plasma  Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS), pH, viscosity, and API gravity measurements. The environmental impact was investigated according to the amount and content of produced water and gas samples and the quality of oil to reduce the impact during bitumen refining. The experimental results showed that while with ISC, the least amount of water is produced; the produced water requires more severe treatment due to its high metal and sulfur contents, and low pH level. On the other hand, since the amount of the produced water for SAGD, SF, and HWI is higher, the produced water management poses handling problems. The oil production from ISC results in the greatest recovery with upgraded oil which will reduce the environmental impact for oil processing when compare to SAGD, HWI, and SF. While all processes produced more or less the same amount of gases, SAGD and SF have additional gas production due to steam generation. As conventional resources decline, it is essential to address environmental challenges to produce from these massive oil sand resources.

The induced fractures will affect heating and flow patterns and thus affect the choice of well spacing and steam injection strategies. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate fracture length for successful CSS projects. 
Transient Temperature Analysis (TTA) is a technique which uses well-bore transient temperature data to estimate reservoir/wellbore characteristics. This paper discusses the feasibility of using TTA to evaluate the lengths of steam-induced fractures in cold lake oil sands by using wellbore transient temperature data in the soaking period of CSS. Numerical simulation model was first established based on history matching production data of a typical well in cold lake oil sands. Then the effect of different fracture lengths on temperature response in soaking phase was examined. Simulation results shows, in the middle and later period of soaking phase, linear relationships are found when temperature drop versus square root time are plotted. However, the correlation between fracture length and the slope is not clear. Based on the heated zone size and heated zone shape analysis at the very first moment of soaking phase, it is found the combined impact of reservoir permeability, reservoir thermal conductivity and fracture length determines the shut-in temperature response, which can be reflected on the slopes of the plots, with certain injection volume. But the qualitative representation of slope using fracture length, permeability and thermal conductivity cannot be found based on the results of finite difference based simulator due to the minor impact of fracture length on heated zone size and numerical dispersion. A more accurate simulation tool is recommended to explore the feasibility of using Transient Temperature Analysis to evaluate fracture length in CSS process.|","Transient Temperature Analysis, fracture length, Cylic Steam Stimualtion"

Shale resource development technology is being improved and optimized over the last decade as the industry has seen a sharp rise in production and IP rates in North America and most recently from Europe and Australia while initial activities are on the rise in Latin America, Middle East and China. Despite such improvements, if one takes a closer look at the performance of the wells, one will find that not all wells are producing commercially and for that matter even wells that are producing commercially not all hydraulic fracture stages are contributing. This scenario is further compounded with the fact that unconventional resource development has a narrow profit margin for the E&P operators and in turn for the service industry. The industry needs to focus on the balance between efficient deployment of fit-for-purpose technology with strict economics in mind. 
This conundrum potentially suggests that when dealing with shale resource one is faced with sweet spot identification in a basin / field and at the same time moving away from geometric (say every 250 ft.) selection of hydraulic fracture stages and placing stages where appropriate from a productivity point of view. 
This paper documents certain well defined criterion used to identify the sweet spot location within a field / basin for the optimal well placement. We further document the vital formation / zone characteristic related information that can define the placement for hydraulic fracture stages and thus move away from the arbitrary geometric placement. Such an optimized plan can allow placement of productive wells and frac stages and thereby enhancing productivity and reducing well drilling and stimulation expenses. The key is effective cost reduction. 
The paper illustrates the well placement optimization process through a combination of seismic attribute analysis combined with petrophysical and geochemical analysis via core and geophysical log measurements. The hydraulic fracture stage placement relies on the need to understand existing natural fracture system through geophysical log measurements and the interaction between the created hydraulic bi-wing tensile fracture and the surrounding shear fractures. 
The paper concludes by presenting examples from three basins demonstrating the practical application of the methodology.|","Economic considerations, Well placement, Fit-for-purpose yechnology, Unconventional is alow margin business, frac stage placement"

Micro-seismic result has shown that compared to conventional reservoir, more complex fracture network will be generated in shale gas reservoirs after hydraulic fracturing stimulations, which provides key channels for shale gas to flow in economic rate. It is vitally important to recognize complex fracture network and model such complex system to better understand gas develop process, optimize hydraulic fracturing design, and determine development plans of shale gas reservoirs. 
Our proposed model enable realistic modeling of complex fracture network growth even with some uncertainty (SPE 157411), but it is possible to represent large-scale fracture network distribution in reservoir modeling and numerical simulation of shale gas development. In this paper, we used this proposed model to generate hydraulic fracture network distribution in shale formation, taking into account interaction between hydraulic fracture and actual large-scale natural fractures. Integrating hydraulic fracture network results and natural fractures in non-stimulated area, highly constrained unstructured gridding and a connection list are constructed, using the Discrete Fracturing Modeling (DFM) method. This model can effectively predict production performance. With real-world well data, the simulation system calibration is done, and the simulated well production performance has good agreement with real-world producing data. Using this simulation system, effective stimulated reservoir volume (ESRV) is also predicted.

The deployment of fiber-optic-based distributed temperature sensing (DTS) in hydraulically fractured wells has enabled us to observe the dynamic temperature profile along the wellbore during treatment, flow back and production not only as a postprocessing step but also in real-time monitoring applications of the hydraulic fracturing process. Fracture initiation points, vertical coverage and number of created fractures can be identified by DTS data. However, to evaluate the well performance, optimize future treatments and better understand fracture modeling, additional accurate quantitative information such as fracture conductivity and geometries need to be inferred from DTS data. In this study, we propose to set up a stochastic inverse problem to infer hydraulic fracture characteristics such as fracture conductivity and geometries by integrating real-time DTS monitoring data. We develop a synthetic non-isothermal simulation model containing a horizontal well with multi-stage transverse hydraulic fractures amenable for realist real-time DTS data. We also provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of different fracture and reservoir parameters in the monitored temperature data by means of sensitivity analysis. To estimate the hydraulic fracture characteristics, we employ the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), an ensemble based sequential model updating method, to assimilate DTS data. The EnKF enables us to perform quantitative fracture characterization and automatic history matching. The EnKF also offers several advantages for this application, including the ensemble formulation for uncertainty assessment, convenient gradient-free implementation, and the flexibility to incorporate additional monitoring data types. 
Examples are presented to illustrate the suitability of the EnKF-based fracture characterization for the inversion of DTS data to infer fracture geometries and conductivity.

For channelized reservoirs with unknown channel distributions, identifying the continuous and sinuous features of channel distributions is crucial for determining their production behaviors. However, traditional history-matching methods are not appropriate because the pixel-based rock-property fields are usually highly non-Gaussian. In this work, a vector-based level-set parameterization technique for channelized reservoirs is presented. We also propose a combination of this parameterization method and a frequently used history-matching approach, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). To properly represent the continuity and sinuosity of its embedded features, the channelized reservoir is parameterized with a vector that consists of level-set function, real radius, and virtual radius on a representing node system. The level-function value indicates the existence of the particular facies; the real radius of a circle in two dimensions or a sphere in three dimensions signifies the size of the facies; and the virtual radius is used to ensure the continuity of the channelized facies. The 2D and 3D examples of channelized reservoirs are set up to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method.

In applications of polymer flood for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), polymer injectivity is of great concern because project economics is sensitive to injection rates. In-situ non-Newtonian polymer rheology is the most crucial factor that affects polymer injectivity. There are several ongoing polymer-injection field tests in which the field injectivities differ significantly from the simulation forecasts. We have developed an analytical model to more accurately calculate and predict polymer injectivity during the field projects to help with optimum injection strategies. Significant viscosity variations during polymer flood occur in the vicinities of wellbores where velocities are high. As the size of a wellblock increases, velocity smears, and thus polymer injectivity is erroneously calculated. In the University of Texas Chemical Flooding Simulator (UTCHEM), the solution was to use an effective radius to capture the ""grid effect,"" which is empirical and impractical for large-scale field simulations with several hundred wells. Another approach is to use local grid refinement near wells, but this adds to the computational cost and limits the size of the problem. An attractive alternative to previous approaches is to extend the Peaceman well model Peaceman 1983) to non-Newtonian polymer solutions. The polymer rheological model and its implementation in UTCHEM were validated by simulating single-phase polymer injectivity in coreflood experiments. On the basis of the Peaceman well model and UTCHEM polymer rheological models covering both shear-thinning and shear-thickening polymers, an analytical polymer injectivity model was developed. The analytical model was validated by comparing results of different gridblock sizes and radial numerical simulation. We also tested a field case by comparing results of a fine-grid simulation and its up-scaled coarse-grid model. A pilot-scale polymer flood was simulated to demonstrate the capability of the proposed analytical model.

This paper details the case history of the highly challenging extended-reach deepwater A-10 well, drilled in the Ursa (""Bear"" in Latin) prospect in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). This 30,000-ft well, drilled from the Ursa tension-leg platform (TLP) at a vertical depth of 18,000 ft and a horizontal displacement (HD) of 20,000 ft, targeted the Yellow sand in the Ursa-Princess section of the greater Mars-Ursa basin. During the drilling of the original hole (OH), two subsequent sidetracks, and two mechanical bypasses, a number of significant hole problems materialized that caused extensive nonproductive time (NPT) and an associated cost overrun. These problems were clearly associated with the drilling of a complex well that combined a high-deviation and extended-reach wellbore with a very narrow and pressure-depleted drilling window, characteristic of the GOM's challenging geopressured environment. In all, at least five independent borehole-failure mechanisms were encountered while drilling the OH and its successive sidetracks/ bypasses, which were exacerbated by an additional complicating factor: 
Lost circulation in natural fractures, ultimately responsible for the loss of the Ursa A-10OH |Lost circulation in induced fractures, with associated heavy mud losses -Borehole fatigue, caused by stress cycling on weak formations caused by annular-pressure fluctuations |Borehole instability caused by too-low downhole hydrostatic pressure, responsible for the loss of Ursa A-10 Sidetrack 1 |Borehole instability caused by an in-situ fractured formation that proved hard to stabilize on wells Ursa A-10 Sidetrack 1 Bypasses 1 and 2, and ultimately forced the well to be completed in shallower Magenta sands |Complicating factor: barite sag of synthetic-based mud in high-deviation wellbores, which led to exacerbation and complication of the previous failure mechanisms.

When effective stress is lower than the critical effectivestress, the outward expansion effect of the coal block caused by grain and gasswell is greater than compaction effect as temperature increases under loweffective stress condition. Therefore, the coal expands primarily outward,which results in fissure opening and permeability increase. When effectivestress is higher than the critical effective stress, high effective stresslimits the coal?s outward expansion. The coal expands inward with increasingtemperature, thus causing fissure closure and permeability decrease. 
On the basis of dimension analysis and regression analysis, combined withexperimental data, this paper develops a high-precision semitheoretical coalpermeability model of Qinshui basin in China. Simultaneously, what this paperpresents is a permeability prediction method: measuring coal core permeabilityand performing dimension analysis and regression analysis. With this work done,we can establish a similar permeability model suitable for other target zones.Thus, the analytical method presented in this paper provides a basis for coalpermeability prediction.|","Document Type

This paper describes the design, testing, installation, and performance of the first fully completed well by use of an intelligent inner completion inside an uncemented liner with openhole packers for zonal isolation. The well-design concept evolved from technical challenges associated with completing long cased-and-cemented laterals in the mature Ekofisk waterflood. The term fully completed implies full reservoir access along the pay length for production and high-rate matrix acid stimulation by use of limited entry for fluid diversion within well segments. The paper covers the development and qualification of customopenhole 7 5/8-in.-liner components that can handle high differential pressures and severe temperature fluctuations of 200°F; the marriage of this complex liner with a five-zone intelligent-completion system; and results from 1 year of system-integration testing. The paper also discusses the strategic placement of both mechanical openhole and inner-string packers based on caliper and drilling logs; challenges met and overcome during installation; and comprehensive downhole-gauge data that confirms the performance of each component before, during, and after the stimulation. The Ekofisk field waterflood began in 1987 and continues to date, exceeding expectations for improved oil recovery while mitigating reservoir compaction. As the waterflood matures, new wells are more often found partially water-swept. Limited infrastructure for lifting and handling the high water production has led to increased emphasis on isolating these water-swept intervals. Cased, cemented, and perforated completions have traditionally been used for this service. Effective placement of cement is challenging in horizontals 4,0008,000 ft in length, where rotation of the liner is not possible and high effective-circulating densities limit rates during cementing. Wide variations in reservoir pore pressures, often in excess of 2,000-psi difference along the lateral, are typical of the Ekofisk chalk and compound the difficulties of cementing. As a result, a new method for zonal isolation has been developed to ensure the success of future infill-drilling campaigns. The design and careful planning that went into the fully completed openhole uncemented-liner strategy resulted in a successful field trial and has proved this solution to be an effective alternative to cemented reservoir liners in long horizontals where zonal isolation is critical. Use of the intelligent-well system (IWS) allowed offline acid stimulation without rig, coiled-tubing, or wireline intervention. What would have traditionally been a significant water producer, with three water-swept zones totaling nearly 2,000 ft across a 4,000-ft reservoir section, has turned out to beone of the best oil producers in the field, with nearly zero watercut. Production results show high productivity with highly negative acidized-completion skins.With large investments in intelligent completions to provide zone-specific inflow control and water shutoff, isolation outside the liner becomes much more important. Over recent years, the Ekofisk wells have illustrated the difficulty of achieving effective cement along lengthy reservoir targets. The openhole fully completed solution combining an accessorized uncemented liner with an inner intelligent-completion string will allow operators to push the limits in terms of lateral length while maintaining full control over producing and nonproducing zones.|","horizontal, smart Wells, openhole, zone isolation, stimulation"

Expandable-sand-screen (ESS), a technology concept envisaged by Shell and initially developed by Petroline, was first field trialed in 1997 with the idea that eliminating the annulus between the sand screen and wellbore would improve downhole sand control and allow enhanced reservoir performance and management. By the end of 2012, ESS was installed in 677 wells, with 418,184 ft of screen deployed globally. As such, ESS has matured as a viable sand-control technology combining openhole-gravel-pack functionality with the installation simplicity of a standalone-screen (SAS) completion. With performance, reliability, and long-term well life expectancy of paramount importance to field-development economics, an extensive internal installation database has been maintained for Weatherfords ESS systems. Over the past 15 years, observation and analysis of design, planning, field implementation, and useful life cycle have been documented in this database. This performance insight provides the foundation for future reliability and has been used to identify learning opportunities, influencing the product evolution and technology-application envelope. With performance and reliability analysis provided and discussed in detail, the applicable ESS envelope is outlined. Product design enhancement, methodical application evaluation, and rigorous operating procedures result in improved successful use. Analysis of both infant and production failure trends are presented and show improvement. These data are used to estimate future life predictions by use of recognized reliability-analysis tools. The applicability of ESS in openhole wells is highlighted, with continuing performance in oil producers, gas producers, water injectors, and underground-gas-storage applications. There are various sand-control technologies successfully used in reservoirs around the globe. This study outlines the applicable envelope for ESS use, providing insight to enable informed evaluation, life-of-well risk appraisal, and, ultimately, reliable sand-control-completion selection for existing or new field-development appraisal.|","ESS, sand control, reliability, completion, expandable sand screen"

Inductive methods, such as electromagnetic steam-assisted gravity drainage(EM-SAGD), have been identified as technically and economically feasiblerecovery methods for shallow oil-sands reservoirs with overburdens of more than30 m (Koolman et al. 2008). However, in EM-SAGD projects, the caprock overlyingoil-sands reservoirs is also electromagnetically heated along with the bitumenreservoir. Because permeability is low in Alberta thermal-project caprockformations (i.e., the Clearwater shale formation in the Athabasca deposit andthe Colorado shale formation in the Cold Lake deposit), the pore pressureresulting from the thermal expansion of pore fluids may not be balanced withthe fluid loss caused by flow and the fluid-volume changes resulting from poredilation. In extreme cases, the water boils, and the pore pressure increasesdramatically as a result of the phase change in the water, which causesprofound effective-stress reduction. After this condition is established, porepressure increases can lead to shear failure of the caprock, the creation ofmicrocracks and hydraulic fractures, and subsequent caprock integrity failure.It is typically believed that low-permeability caprocks impede the transmissionof pore pressure from the reservoir, making them more resistant to shearfailure (Collins 2005, 2007). In cases of induced thermal pressurization,low-permeability caprocks are not always more resistant. In this study,analytical solutions are obtained for temperature and pore-pressure risescaused by the constant EM heating rate of the caprock. These analyticalsolutions show that pore-pressure increases from EM heating depend on thepermeability and compressibility of the caprock formation. For stiff orlow-compressibility media, thermal pressurization can cause fluid pressures toapproach hydrostatic pressure, and shear strength to approach zero forlow-cohesive-strength units of the caprock (units of the caprock with high siltand sand percentage) and sections of the caprock with pre-existing fractureswith no cohesion.|","Document Type

This paper examines application of the method of characteristics (MOC) to determine pressure distribution in a 1D matrix of shale gas. Because of gas expansion and local desorption in shale gas, pressure distribution changes during production. We developed a semianalytic MOC solution of gas flow in shale by use of the analogous-continuum approximation (apparent permeability). The MOC solution is derived with the inclusion of compressibility, gas-slippage effect, and desorption. Through quantitative comparison of pressure profiles and history plots, we used a simulation approach to verify the accuracy of the analytic solution. Results suggest that the simulation results are consistent with our MOC solution, which can also be used to evaluate impacts of different parameters on pressure distribution. Prediction of pressure distribution over time will greatly enhance approximation of reservoir performance.|","Pressure Distribution , Shale gas, Method of Characteristics"

The aim of this article is to describe the development of a finite element computer platform for the modeling, analysis, and simulation of a coupled reservoir and geomechanics system. The conditions that are assumed are the simplest possible, so that we assume homogeneity and isotropy in the material, an elastic behavior of the rock with small deformations, a quasi-static equilibrium, the absence of fractures and isothermal state. The study evolves sequentially in stages, from the flow of a single fluid in a porous medium, through the two-phase case, up to the three-phase black oil model. The starting point is based on a mathematical model that is an extension of Biot's theory for flow in porous media, and which accounts for coupling the reservoir of fluid flow to the rock deformation and stress states. The mathematical model is reformulated in variational terms, in order to get a proper formulation that enables us to apply the weighted residuals methods of Galerkin with linear interpolation functions. The use of linear interpolant functions reduces the computational work but at the cost of having to face some inestabilities in the solutions. Once the model is discretized, we make use of appropriate software to built an unstructured meshing domain using tetrahedral elements. We carried out a computational model founded in the design of a program based in the C++ language, to perform the tasks of numerical calculations of the coefficients, assembling the stiffness element by element matrices, and for solving the resulting equations. It is intended to develop the computer program in a modular structure, so that the solution of the coupled geomechanics/reservoir system can be performed through an iterative procedure. The development of this code is still in its initial stage, but the approachs show promise. At the end two case studies are presented, which are compared with analytical solution for verification of the approach|","Reservoir simulation, Finite element methods, Stabilized finite element methods, Coupled reservoir and geomechanics"

There are sand formations that do not have a minimum contact pore space cemented. Typically, these sands have very low toughness, high permeability, and high porosity. Such factors allow fines and solids migration. The consequence of this scenario is the increase of workover interventions and equipment damage/erosion caused by sand flow, thus resulting in increasing cost, lost time, and insufficient production. Drilling these formations is challenging. Taking core samples to perform rock mechanic tests in a laboratory is also a difficult task. Additionally, there are cases where wells do not have sonic dipole surveys to help with evaluations. Usually, the samples are not uniform, have cracks, are broken, or completely dispersed, making their application in rock mechanic characterizations impossible. 
The presented methodology applies the Mohr-Coulomb cycling test for the first time to actually process step-rate, fracturing, and falloff tests. Field tests using this technique have shown good correlations and obtained reliable curves for hydraulic fracturing simulators. A package of rock mechanics equations described in the oil industry are evaluated and tested in field scale. 
Many times, engineering teams must have a source of equations which can easily calculate required parameters to be used for sieve analysis, gravel pack, and fracture pack projects. Basically, the methodology is reliable because of the equations of theoretical soil mechanics (Terzagui 1943), Mohr-Coulomb, and field practices of determinations of minimum in-situ stresses and overburdens. After field test confirmations, the objective of this matter is to present correlations of Terzagui (1943) and Mohr-Coulomb equations to be used during gravel, fracture pack, and hydraulic fracturing operations. The methodology has an important presence during the study to help minimize risk during these jobs and obtain good approach simulations because, as previously discussed, this type of sandstone makes obtaining formation samples challenging. Equations can provide a good number of useful calculations and help reduce operational risk when performing these types of well completions or treatments.|","Mohr, Coulomb, Rock Mechanics, Step Rate"

The in situ stresses constraint is one of the most difficult parameter in a geomechanics model. Most of them are simple models in which is not involved the influence of geological discontinuities such as complex fault system, bedding plane, folds and joints. Recent studies have pointed out that these can significantly impact on the in situ stress states, leading to changes in magnitudes and rotations of stress tensor along formation sections. However, taking into account the structural geology and projecting the stress state underground, its uncertainty can be reduced. It results in an improvement during the well construction design to obtain a safer operational fluid density window, optimum well trajectories and an effective borehole stability analysis. 
This paper presents an integrated methodology to interpolate the magnitude of the stresses and their orientation, including the effect of structural geology. A case of study from Eastern Basin Venezuela, SJ Field, was analyzed. First, a review of the structural geology model was done to identify its origin and the fault history. Then, a geomechanics 1D model with the pore pressure calculation, rock mechanics properties and in situ stress estimations was developed to be integrated with a kinematic analysis in which the structural restoration was defined. Besides, dynamic analysis using a numerical simulation with finite element in a 2D structural section was performed. 
The results confirmed that stress state changed not only in orientation, but also in magnitude near to the Anaco Thrust. As a main consequence, the boreholes located next to this structural element experiment variations in depth from normal to strike-slip regime.|","stress, drilling, finite elements, geomechanics, structural geology"

In the last 10 years, shale gas has emerged as an alternative source because of its contribution to oil and gas reserves. Colombia has a high hydrocarbon potential in unconventional shale gas deposits, and this become the main objective of the national oil industry. Currently proven reserves of conventional gas in Colombia are about 6 TCF, while technically recoverable reserves of shale gas according to the US. Energy Information Administration (EIA) studies1 are about 55 TCF, so successful production of these reservoirs will increase significantly gas reserves in Colombia. 
Ecopetrol was the first company in Colombia in starting the characterization of unconventional shales through the stratigraphic well La Luna-1 located in the Medium Magdalena Valley, from which 3445 feet of core were recovered in five months between 2011 and 2012. 
The need for interpretation frameworks in order to understand properties such as rock source quality, mechanical properties and production performance from a diverse range of measurements require a laboratory characterization of rock properties that is an important part of any resource evaluation. This was the challenge for the labs of the Colombian Petroleum Institute, that based in its experience in Conventional reservoir analysis could adopt its skills and methodologies for analyze 2851 rock samples. The work flow includes geochemical analysis for Total Organic Content (TOC), Pyrolysis Rock Eval VI (parameters S1, S2, Tmax) and quantification of gas content (canister). Samples selection for other analysis was based on core Tomography and Spectral Core Gamma. From the same foot of core, the samples were taken for petrographic analysis, quantitative mineralogical analysis by XRD, mineral distribution and microtexture by SEM, geomechanical Analysis (elastic module and the rock strength), basic petrophysical analysis and Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP). The information obtained was integrated in order to obtain petrographic rock types, hydraulic rock types and identify the most prospective intervals.

As part of the strategic projects for reserves incorporation in the south-east Mexican Gulf, Heavy Oil-Carbonate fields have been explored in an area of about 900 km2 called ""Campeche Oriente"". As of today, a total of 13 extra heavy oil offshore fields have been discovered and delimited. In order to characterize this area in an early stage of its development, a conceptual model for Wellbore Stability Analysis of the new fields, in coherence with a nearby developed fields Geomechanical knowledge has been built. As a first approach to evaluate the regional coherence on the geomechanical modeling parameters, an existing and calibrated model previously built in an offset development field was applied to the exploratory fields in Campeche Oriente basin, focusing in design and drilling optimization purposes. As a result of this analysis, nearby field modeling parameters showed good correlation in an area of 900 km2, covering the exploration fields. It has been possible to identify two main sectors (East and West) with differences in shallow sediments velocities leading to slight variation of the normal compaction trend. Based on these regional results, it has been possible to identify the fields that fall on each sector allowing, on a first stage of well design, the application of a fit for purpose geomechanical model, adjusted for each sector in order to reproduce geological conditions and operative events of the area.

Palo Azul field in Ecuador has always presented challenges for drilling high-inclination wells. The main issue is the natural tendency of the Napo formation to drop inclination even when using fulcrum or push-the-bit bottom hole assemblies (BHAs) designed to build inclination. Napo formation is composed of many intercalations of sandstone, limestone and unstable shale. 
With the introduction of a Point-the-Bit rotary steerable system (RSS), a successful drilling campaign was developed. The capacity of this RSS to build inclination in 8 <U+00BD>-in-hole sections independently of the type of formation drilled was the technical solution to build inclination while drilling through the formation that historically causes a drop in inclination. However, short trips to the 9?-in casing shoe and trips to surface have been very difficult, with several problems such as packing off, tight hole and back-reaming. 
Several times the 7-in-liner did not reach the bottom of the hole, requiring an extra trip to condition the well for a new attempt to run the liner. 
The use of a hole opener to enlarge the hole from 8-<U+00BD> to 9-<U+00BD> inches while drilling with a point-the-bit RSS was the best technical solution to finish the hole section in a single run, avoiding extra trips to surface and ensuring a clean 7-in-liner run. 
The point-the-bit RSS and hole-opener run performed in this study was the first successfully run in a high-inclination well (51° to 68°) in Ecuador, generating an average dogleg severity of 5°/100 ft. 
This technical solution is allowing the operator to plan more high-inclination or horizontal wells to optimize Palo Azul field production. 
The synergy between the Directional Drilling Company and the hole opener provider to simulate and execute the run described above with an integrated BHA was the key to success in implementing this technological solution for the client.|","Hole, Enlargment, Steerable, Rotary"

A post stack seismic inversion has been applied to 2D and 3D seismic data in order to obtain a quantitative assessment of rock properties including density, compressional velocities and porosity in a tight gas sandstone. To achieve this objective, the study develops a new relationship between Acoustic Impedance (AI) and porosity. 
This study focuses on a post stack seismic inversion through a band limit technique that involves three major steps: 1) Derive a low frequency velocity model using sonic logs, 2) Invert the seismic traces using a recursive inversion procedure giving as a result the middle frequency model band of the AI, and 3) Combine the previous models in order to obtain the full band limit inversion product. 
The methodology is demonstrated using data from a tight gas reservoir formation chracterized with low porosity and permeability located at approximately 2, 000 meters (TVDSS) in the study area. From the model inversion, the acoustic impedance (AI) is compared with variations in porosity resulting in a reasonable correlation for the stratigraphic interval studied.

The increasing complexities of wellbore geometry imply an increasing potential of damage resulting from downhole bit wear. Although the locations of critical bit wear can be difficult to predict, the quantification of the actual bit teeth/cutter wear is important to achieve reduced cost per foot and predictable bit failure. 
There is no acceptable universal mathematical model that describes bit wear accurately because of the complex nature of downhole conditions. Usually, either analytical models or real-time data analytics are used separately to estimate and predict bit wear. Combining both methods and using them simultaneously is an efficient way to address this limitation. This paper presents a new simple analytical bit wear model coupled with data analytics using real-time gamma ray data to suppress the uncertainties of the interacting formation properties and other intervening variables. The fractional bit wear of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit cutters is obtained from the geometric correlation between height loss and the cutter volume loss. The volume loss of cutters is assumed to be proportional to weight on bit (WOB), cutter sliding distance, rock strength, and rock quartz content. 
The paper presents a field example to predict and estimate the bit wear using actual data. Gamma ray and rate of penetration (ROP) data of the initial drilling section are used to train the model to quantify the influence of formation strength interaction with the analytical model. Then estimation of ROP using the new bit wear model was carried out using actual field drilling parameters. The calculated ROP profile closely matched with the actual data within reasonable accuracy of less than 5%. Specific procedures are proposed for effective prediction of ROP and bit life.|","Gamma Ray Log, PDC Bit Wear, ROP, Analytical Model"

The hydraulic re- fractured wells can be seen as a cheaper and simpler solution than to drill new wells to access undrained areas of the reservoir as a result of the production period of the first post- fractured well. But to access to undrained areas during the second fracturing job, a change in the direction of minimum stress must occur because this direction is a key parameter which defines the final propagation direction of hydraulic fracture. [1] |In recent decades, reservoir engineers have been dedicated to study and model the changes in reservoir geomechanics that are caused by changes in pore pressure as a result of the injection and production fluids. Among the main phenomena that result from the reduction of pore pressure are the rock compaction, which generates a decreasing pore size and consequently the decrease in permeability of the formation, and the surface ground subsidence in cases under extreme condition. [2] The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of a designed set of fluids at high rates and pressures in order to make the reservoir rock fail and create a long and high-conductivity propped fracture; and thereafter the well is put into production for a period of time which generally comprises several years at a rate of flow variable as a function of properties and energy of producing formation, and also of fractures properties such as geometry, size (length and vertical extent), and conductivity. |","hydraulic, stress, fracturing"

Evaluation of fields with sand problems is a complex activity that involves different disciplines of study and the review of several information, which is mainly related to well logs and reports, allowing for each of the studied wells the selection and sizing of recommended sand control methods. Automation of these calculation, with the use of a software originally designed to process reservoir static model, allows the use of all available well logs in the field to identify zones having the optimum rock properties to apply a specific sand control method, and to develop maps that shows the sized sand control methods applicable to each layer of the reservoir. Additionally, these results lead to more broadly assess all existing completions in this field and explain their success or failure over time. 
Currently, several reservoirs in Venezuela and worldwide present sand issues, where in some cases the consensus for used sand control methods in the field have been established by trial and error over time, but in the case of a successful sand production reduction, a wrong selection and sizing of the filter media can bring problems from flow production restriction to plugging by fines, both affecting the well productivity or even the well life. 
The need for integrated studies to evaluate these fields, covering all technical aspects involved, raises the need to automate calculation process performed for each well in the study, so that in this way is possible to maximize number of studied wells and thereby, obtain more comprehensive and detailed results to start, in a shorter time and with much more available information, the evaluation and analysis of the reservoir in terms of sand control completions.

Ramon, Halliburton| Bailon, L., PEMEX| Valenzuela, A., PEMEX","|Abstract 
Currently, three unconventional wells have been drilled and three are nearing completion that have been targeted in the Upper Jurassic Pimienta. This source rock formation is a candidate to be Mexico's first shale and could become the most productive shale zone in the country. There are several reasons for this success, which are discussed in this paper. 
The primary subject well discussed was targeted in the oil window. Several horizontal completion techniques can be applied when stimulating these wells in northern Mexico; the plug and perforate (plug-and-perf) method is most commonly used at this time. During initial planning, this well was also going to use the plug-and-perf with conventional perforating and stages isolated using pump-down wireline plugs. 
However, the particular well discussed here was instead completed by fracturing all the different stages using coiled tubing (CT)hydrajet perforating using a 2-in outside diameter (OD) string. This process employs jet dynamics principles and anew jetting tool design, creating clean, non-damaged perforation tunnels that help reduce fracture initiation pressure compared to conventional perforating. This process creates the most effective wellbore-to-reservoir connection possible, and then creates zonal isolation between stages using sand plugs. 
After flowback, this well is considered the best shale producer in northern Mexico with gas and light oil production and has created new opportunities for drilling targeting the Upper Jurassic Pimienta shale, particularly in the oil window in the Burgos basin. 
This is the first oil source rock reservoir horizontal well ever completed through the entire lateral section in conjunction with CT in Mexico.|","Pimienta, Shale"

Adequate fluid placement and complete zonal coverage during a matrix acid stimulation is critical to the success of a treatment. The use of distributed temperature sensing (DTS) is a relatively new technique that can be used for monitoring downhole fluid placement during a treatment. It uses a fiber-optic distributed-temperature-monitoring system to provide continuous temperature profiles throughout the entire length of the well, giving relevant information to perform qualitative and, in some cases, quantitative analysis of fluid placement downhole. 
This paper describes the design and construction of a laboratory scale flow-loop apparatus to demonstrate the application of DTS technology for downhole fluid placement monitoring. The apparatus constructed contains three inlet and exiting points to simulate well perforations, a method to raise or lower fluid temperature and thus introduce temperature spikes or tracers, and optical fiber and sensing equipment and instrumentation to measure and compare measured and calculated rate data. The system is capable of simulating several well flow conditions, such as fluid injection, fluid production and crossflow. 
The designed apparatus has proven to be versatile, compact, and useful for understanding and training professionals regarding how DTS technology can be used for monitoring downhole fluid flow and placement.|","Laboratory Apparatus, Stimulation Monitoring, DTS - Distributed Temperature Surveys"

A., SPE| Salazar, L., SPE| Jaime, P. I., SPE| Tallec, G., SPE| Chan, K., SPE| Gerwig, T., FEI Co.","|Abstract 
High resolution Backscattered Electron images (BSE) can be used to extract textural information such as grain and pore size; specific surface area; and so forth. Based on this information porosity and permeability can be estimated. On the other hand, low resolution Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy Imaging (EDS) provides valuable information about the mineralogy and chemical composition of the rock samples. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) instruments are capable of generating BSE images of core and cuttings samples in a relatively short period of time at very high resolutions. The story is different if EDS images are also acquired. For example EDS images at 20 µm point spacing usually do not take longer than 30 minutes to be captured, but if point spacing is reduced to 10 µm, then measurement time increases approximately by 4 times. 
This paper proposes a new methodology to combine high resolution BSE images with low resolution EDS images and to use the combined textural and mineralogical information in order to improve grain segmentation, grain size calculations as well as estimating porosity and permeability in rock samples. This methodology starts with the acquisition of the BSE and EDS images looking for an optimal relationship between acquisition time and image quality. Secondly the registration and fusion of the two images is performed and advanced image processing techniques are applied to extract information that corresponds to underlying physical characteristics such as porosity and permeability. 
Results of this methodology are encouraging, 4 to 5 µm point spacing BSE images have been registered and fused with 20 µm EDS images and excellent grain segmentation has been achieved. Calculated porosity values show a good match with helium porosity core data and estimated permeability using the Kozeny-Carman equation gives results in the same order of magnitude. 
This new approach saves time, operating costs and enable geoscientists to collect valuable rock data at the micro-scale level. Furthermore, this information can be used to estimate important rock properties when integrated with other data sources to improve reservoir characterization especially in cases where information is scarce or difficult to obtain.|","Porosity from BSE images, QEMSCAN, Registration and Fusion, Backscattered Electron Images, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy"

Sand production in oil and gas wells is a complex problem that requires a multidisciplinary analysis and the use of new methodologies and technologies to be solved, which often requires a combination of several of them to arrive at an optimal solution of the problem and thus increase the productivity of oil fields. 
This comprehensive strategy must start from the drilling, continue in the completion and extends to the production stage. To implement this strategy, a methodology that includes the integration of field and laboratory data and is complemented by an assessment Geomechanics was developed. 
In the industry there is no software that would make a comprehensive evaluation and analysis described in the previous methodology, therefore it is designed a tool for this purpose, which allows to automate and streamline the decision-making process (developing optimal workflows to reduce evaluation times per well to 50%) and create a friendly graphic environment for the user. 
The tool includes the following modules: Production, completion and perforation. The Production module includes: selection of wells and quantification of costs associated with interventions by sanding problems, diagnostic charts for root cause analysis of the problem of sand production, characterization graphs of intervals with sand production (mineralogy and grain size), selection of alternatives for management and / or exclusion of sand, production modeling, technical and economic evaluation of selected alternatives, etc..

Sand production in oil and gas wells is a complex problem that requires a multidisciplinary analysis to arrive at an optimal solution of the problem and thus increases the productivity of oil fields with problems of production of sand. 
Many operators choose as first alternative, the exclusion of sand, avoiding doing a risk management, which ultimately provides lower index of productivity and in many cases convert the wells with sand problems in unproductive wells. Therefore always be a better option the sand management and take as a last option the sand exclusion, obviously framed within a technical and economic evaluation of alternatives. 
In most cases when we refer to a chemical treatment for sand control, it tends to confuse with chemical consolidation treatments, however a different option, is the application of chemical treatments to modify the zeta potential of the formation fines that has been very successful. 
Modifying The zeta potential to optimum range, provides a strengthened attraction between the particles to optimally align proppant type, sand particles, fines, etc., allowing the formation of conglomerates of proppant, sand, fines, etc., improving conductivity and control of fines migration. 
This study focused on the evaluation in the laboratory of chemical treatment (compatibility, zeta potential and rock-fluid testing, etc.), mineralogical and granulometric analysis of sand and fines produced by wells with sanding problems, selection of wells and treatment zones, quantification of costs associated with sanding problems, technical and economic evaluation of the application of treatments in candidate wells, etc.

Production in the Shushufindi-Aguarico oil field (SSFD), Ecuador, is from three stacked reservoir sands: basal Tena, U, and T. The SSFD is considered under saturated and is characterized as having two simultaneous driving mechanisms. The first mechanism is associated with solution gas drive, and the second is associated with an active bottom and lateral aquifer. This latter mechanism offers high recovery factors that oscillate between 25 and 30% and high water cut in most of the wells, especially in those producing from the T sand. 
The reservoir is compartmentalized by stratigraphic pinchouts with the result that each of the sands has a different pressure regime: T sand from 2400 to 2600 psi, U sand from 1400 to 3000 psi, and basal Tena sand from 1200 psi. The reservoir pressure limits natural flow; therefore, artificial lift is required. 
The dominant artificial lift method is the electric submersible pump (ESP), which is used in 106 wells. Other methods in the field are hydraulic pumping in 5 wells, gas lift in 1 well, and bean pumping in 1 well. 
The saturation pressure for the U and T sands varies between 1010 and 1062 psi. Some wells are exploited with dynamic bottomhole pressure (Pwf) below the bubblepoint pressure; there are cases where Pwf is approximately 600 psi. 
Originally, the casing used to complete wells in the field was 5 <U+00BD>-in. <U+00D7> 17 lbm/ft and 7-in. <U+00D7> 26 to 29 lbm/ft. The wells perforated during the last 3 years have been completed with 9 5/8-in. <U+00D7> 47 to 53 lbm/ft casing and 7-in.<U+00D7> 29 lbm/ft or 26 lbm/ftliner. From the beginning of production in the field in 1970, a total of 140 ESPs have been run: 17 ESPs in 5 <U+00BD>-in. casing, 39 ESPs in 7-in.casing, 42 ESPs in 9 5/8-in. casing, and 42 ESPs in 7-in. casing. 
Wells are completed as monobore completions, either in the U or T sand, or have been selectively completed when both sands are to be exploited sequentially. The latter completion includes a sliding door to allow sequential production over time. In 2012, concentric dual completions were deployed in four wells, with some success. This technology involves high risk to the well operations because of its complexity (numerous accessories), tie drifts, and lack of flexibility to intervene the well with even a rigless intervention. Additionally, this completion technique requires high CAPEX and a considerable amount of surface equipment. This makes a future workover operation lengthy and risky. 
A very important production consideration in this field is that the hydrocarbons regulatory authority in Ecuador, ARCH, does not allow the commingled exploitation of the U and T sands because of the issues this raises with reservoir management and petroleum accounting. 
The technical and regulatory challenges are the drivers for considering intelligent completion (IC) or compact IC for the operator, Consorcio Shushufindi (CSSFD), and evaluating and testing IC and compact IC completions for this field are the objectives of the present technical work. 
As part of this work, significant advances have been made in increasing the information that makes up the portfolio for a candidate well; this information includes a definition of the architecture required, conceptual simulations to estimate production rate for the sands, operation philosophy, advantages and disadvantages of the application, and antecedents worldwide. In addition, technical presentations have been conducted at all levels of management to explain the technical justification and the benefits of implementing IC completions in terms of production optimization, reserves development, reduction of formation damage induced by the effect of well intervention (recompletions), etc.. 
Based on early technical meetings with the ARCH, Petroamazonas (PAM), and the Hydrocarbon Secretary (SH), a pilot test has been approved which will implement and evaluate IC in five wells in the SSFD field.|","Intelligent completion"

Most of the reservoirs in Ecuador are in mature fields with subhydrostatic pressure. To produce from these reservoirs, an artificial lift system must be included as part of the completion, and stimulation treatments are frequently required to produce economically. 
Hydraulic fracturing is commonly applied today to remove formation damage, since the penetration of the matrix treatments sometimes is not enough to fully bypass the damage zone because of the depletion. However, in the U formation, after performing fracturing treatments, the maximum drawdown is limited to ensure proppant pack stability. Proppant flowback has been an issue in the first wells hydraulically fractured. Apart from the production limitations, the consequences of proppant flowback may include: decreasing of fracture conductivity, damage to surface and downhole equipment, additional operational cost, and loss of workover efficiency, one of the main factors affecting the Ecuador oil industry scenario. 
All these consequences have created the need for a new approach to be able to produce these well economically without the mentioned issues. An innovative fiber-based technology for proppant flowback control (FBPFC) was proposed. At surface, low concentrations of short fibers are easily dispersed into the fracturing slurry. Meanwhile, at downhole conditions, the fibers are activated by temperature, becoming sticky and bonding with each other to create a continuous web that consolidates the proppant pack. The fiber web has negligible effect on conductivity, creating a stable proppant pack that is resistant to cyclic stress loading. This translates into higher drawdown and productivity. 
The novel FBPFC technique has been successfully implemented in Ecuador, after determining the associated risk of proppant flowback, based on the geomechanical reservoir properties. More than 30 stages have been pumped with this technique without proppant flowback despite optimizing the drawdown after the treatments. This resulted in a four- to five-fold increase in production compared with a two- to three-fold increase in wells where the bottomhole flowing pressure was limited by the risk of proppant flow back. The use of FBPFC enabled the full potential of the reservoir to be realized.|","Proppant flowback control, Fibers, Production enhancement, Hydraulic fracturing"

However, one of the main challenges has always been planning the right acquisition time for the first sigma measurement. The implementation of a ruggedized PNG source in the multifunction logging-while-drilling (LWD) formation evaluation platform, has allowed reservoir saturation using capture sigma measurements in open hole environments. 
Comparisons of LWD sigma with wireline cased hole sigma has helped cross-validate the reliability and shortcomings of both measurements. On the other hand, and going beyond the historical application, new methodologies to apply sigma-while-drilling in formation evaluation have been developed. Through the integration of LWD resistivity and sigma measurements, which are collocated in the multifunction LWD platform, both formation water salinity and water saturation can be simultaneously determined. New developments in Multi Depth of Investigation (MDOI) sigma help us ensure that a non-invaded or true formation sigma value is determined.

One of the most common problems during the hydrocarbon production is sand production. Efficient control of the sand production without causing formation damage will depend on the knowledge that we have of the reservoir and also of the designs and estimates that we make during the drilling, completion and production. Sand production causes many problems ranging from collapses in casing, failures of subsurface equipment and surface facilities and accumulation in downhole generating continuous interventions, up to the point of making unproductive wells, thus putting in risk the future interventions of the wells and the capacity thereof in the long term. 
In the oil industry there is a diverse range of technologies to control and / or exclusion of sand in open hole and / or case hole that can be mechanicals or chemicals, but the selection must be done carefully, taking into account granulometric and mineralogical criteria for proper selection, because although that we choose the best alternative technique and do a good sand control, the solution may not be optimal from the economic standpoint. 
A good decision making process considers other alternatives for sand control, such as handling the drawdown pressure, which in some cases proves to be a technical and economic alternative, especially when the critical drawdown pressure (CDP) presents values over 40% of the reservoir pressure. 
A geomechanics evaluation establishes the predictive model of sand production, which allows us to determine the critical drawdown Pressure. From density logs, Vsh, sonic logs, etc. and correlations, the compressive strength (UCS), cohesion, angle of internal friction and mechanical properties of the rock (Young modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc.) are determined. With a geomechanical model (previously selected and evaluated with field and laboratory data), the pressure gradient and the mechanical properties of the rock, the predictive model of sand production is established.

The channel hydraulic fracturing technique was recently introduced to the oil and gas industry as an alternative to the conventional hydraulic fracturing methodology. Channel fracturing involves the creation of a network of open channels or flow paths within the stimulated fracture volume, enabling the increased flow of hydrocarbons through the channels and into the wellbore. This paper investigates the applicability of this novel technique in the Vaca Muerta shale and presents a case history evaluating the potential production benefits of this methodology. 
Starting with a calibrated geomechanical model, an index profile was created using the ratio between the young's modulus and closure stress to determine if channel fracturing is applicable in the Vaca Muerta. The technique is compared to conventional hydraulic fracturing case to identify the differences in the created fracture properties. Based on the created channel fracturing index profile, the gross Vaca Muerta shale interval was divided into three intervals (lower, middle, and upper) and the process was repeated across each section to determine the incremental production impact across interval. 
The result of this study shows that the channel fracturing technique is applicably in the Vaca Muerta shale and can potentially increase the production performance. The analysis also shows that this technique is more favorable primarily across the upper and middle Vaca Muerta intervals than the lower Vaca Muerta interval due to the high organics, low rock moduli, and high stress. Also, permeability degradation of the proppant pack does not negatively impact the overall conductivity in a Channel fracture system. Instead, loss of aperture reduces the conductivity by orders of magnitude.|","Vaca Muerta Shale, Unconventional Resources, Channel Fracturing, Completion Optimization, Hydraulic Fracture Stimulation"

We then evaluate the efficiency of several production strategies: (a) traditional continuous gas flooding using parallel horizontal wells and using the currently abundant shale gas, (b) water-alternating-gas (WAG) flooding, (c) huff-and-puff injection/production strategies using lean gas/rich gas in a traditional (single) horizontal well with multiple fractures, (d) flooding using appropriate gases (e.g., CO2, N2, CH4) using appropriate well configurations (mainly horizontal), with the viscosity reduction resulting from the gas dissolution into the liquids, and (e) thermal processes, in which the viscosity reduction is achieved by heating, possibly to the point of liquid vaporization and transport through the matrix to the production wells as a gas.

Exploration drilling is venturing out into deeper regions of water. While exploring these deeper water depths, large hydrocarbon deposits have been found below salt formations. These reservoirs are located in formations called ""pre salts,"" which are located below the salt formations. Pre-salt reservoirs have been found in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and the North Sea. Completions in salt formations can be difficult owing to the creep behavior that the salt formations exhibit. Creep behavior results from the instability of the salt formation, which causes a slow flow and results in permanent deformations. Creep and deformation occur over time and are initiated once the salt formation has been penetrated. Completion of the wellbore does not stop formation creep. The constant creep of the formation causes excess stress on the well completions, which will eventually cause the casing to collapse. This study presents a geomechanical model, which can be used to predict the in-situ casing stress in a salt formation throughout the lifetime of a well. The model incorporates various parameters, like formation and wellbore pressure and formation temperature, as well as casing, cement, and rock properties. In addition, the impact of variations in temperature around the wellbore, drawdown pressure during production, the shape of the wellbore, and formation anisotropic properties are also investigated. The results indicate that many well-established factors that affect wellbore stability in a conventional and non-creep formation may not be valid in salt formations that exhibit creep behavior. |","Salt Formation, Geomechanical Modeling, Anisotropic Conditions, Wellbore Stability, Finite Element Analysis"

In this study, a numerical model for the fracture analysis of gas pipelines is developed. We propose a novel model for analysis of slow and fast rates of fatigue crack propagation. The boundary element method by taking the displacement correlation techniques is implemented to compute the stress intensity factor for an existing crack. The proposed model is based on the nonlinear finite element method as a strong computational tool which can be used for fracture and fatigue analyses in gas pipelines. A FORTRAN based finite element in-house code is developed and used in this study. 
INTRODUCTION  
Recently, the initiation and growth rate of crack propagation in both brittle and ductile materials in pipelines have received considerable attention. The ductile fracture is associated with a relatively large plastic zone at the tip of an existing crack while this zone is significantly small in brittle materials. It should be noted that the size of the plastic zone in a crack propagation analysis is proportional to the initial and current length of an existing crack. The failure mechanism always starts with slow-rate crack propagation and ends with a catastrophic failure when the crack propagation rate is significantly high. 
Developing a numerical model in order to estimate the crack growth rate in pressurized pipelines (for a dynamic internal pressure) is of crucial importance. In fact, any fatigue issues or catastrophic failures in a pipeline structure is because of the existence of small micro-cracks in the system (due to manufacturing cares, etc.). In order to control the crack growth rate, normally materials with improved physical and mechanical properties and better resistance to brittle fracture can be used. However environmental factors such as ground and ambient temperatures, humidity, and operating loads also play important roles in crack initiation and growth stages. [1,2].|",""

ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company (EMURC) recently completed a subsea technology development and qualification program which included performance testing of an in-line electrocoalescer device supplied by FMC Technologies (FMC). This paper will summarize the results from these performance tests. 
Although heavy oil has been processed on-shore successfully for many decades, processing heavy oil in deepwater, subsea, or Arctic fields is extremely challenging. One key challenge is oil-water separation, in which physical separation is constrained by the high viscosity of the crude and the narrow density difference between oil and water. Installing conventional electrostatic coalescers or dehydrators is often not economical or impractical at remote locations. As part of ExxonMobil's subsea program, several different separation technologies have been investigated and tested that could enable development of these fields. One example of such a technology is FMC's InLine ElectroCoalescer (IEC). 
FMC has developed an innovative, compact electrostatic technology that enhances the coalescence of water droplets dispersed in emulsified oils. This technology has the potential to considerably improve the performance of the downstream oil-water separator. By applying an electrical field to an oil-water mixture, the dispersed water droplets become polarized and reorient themselves in the electrical field. As these water droplets approach one another, attractive forces between the individual water droplets lead to coalescence. Larger water droplets are formed, that can be separated faster and more easily in the downstream separation equipment. The IEC can be used to increase the throughput, performance, and reliability of existing oil processing systems while reducing the energy consumption and/or use of chemical demulsifiers. In new processing systems, either subsea or topside, deployment of the IEC has the potential to significantly reduce the size and weight of the downstream separation equipment, thereby lowering the overall capital expenditure. 
The results presented in this paper are from performance tests that have been carried out on the IEC at FMC's testing facilities in the Netherlands, under EMURC's supervision. Extensive testing was executed with both medium and heavy crude oils. The operating temperatures were varied in a range representative for subsea processing applications, where heating of the process fluids is difficult. Thus, the performance of the IEC was evaluated over a range of oil viscosities. Water-in-oil concentration, flow velocity, upstream shear, and electric field strength were also varied to investigate their effects on the IEC performance. The results demonstrate that the IEC is able to deliver high pre-conditioning performance to medium and heavy crude oil emulsions, given the appropriate process conditions and electrical settings are used.|","Oil-water separation, Electrocoalescence, Subsea, Heavy oil, Oil dehydration"

Geotechnical input parameters - friction factors - for pipeline design are handled probabilistically to suit modern reliability-based design analyses. However, they are often assigned unnecessarily wide ranges between high and low estimates (or bounds), and these are assumed to apply uniformly along the pipeline in some design steps. This paper clarifies the causes of geotechnical variability and provides consistent approaches for capturing these realistically. We use field data from real pipelines to demonstrate benefits arising from: (a) spatial averaging over the length scale of the relevant design check, (b) input parameter covariance, meaning that unrealistic combinations of inputs are ignored, and (c) quantification of natural soil spatial variability. Application: Geotechnical variability is often handled in an unrealistic and ultra-onerous manner in subsea pipeline design. This paper presents data and analyses that show the benefit of more realistic modelling of geotechnical variability, using input parameter covariance and appropriate smoothing of pipe-soil interaction parameters. These methods have immediate practical application leading to improved subsea pipeline design. Results, Observations, and Conclusions: Field data of soil conditions and pipeline embedment from projects in shallow and deep water are presented and interpreted to illustrate the length scales over which soil properties, pipe embedment and axial and lateral pipe-soil resistance typically vary. These observations show the over-conservatism of typical design practice, in which extreme values of embedment and soil resistance are assumed to apply over the entire pipeline length. Instead, the data are used to quantify the beneficial smearing effects that result from variability in soil properties and lay conditions. We show that these improvement in the geotechnical inputs lead to a less onerous structural response. Significance of Subject Matter: This subject matter provides a basis to remove unnecessary conservatism in the handling of geotechnical variability in subsea pipeline design. Put simply, variability has both a magnitude and a length scale. Current design practice often assumes the most onerous length scale - infinite - and our paper provides methodologies to improve on this.|","Pipeline, Walking, Variability, Buckling, Geotechnical"

The production of natural gas from gas hydrate deposits poses chalenges such as assessing hydrate recovery rates from physical properties and geological structure of the hydrate reservoir, securing the economic viability of produced gas from a particular resource, and keeping process safe from geomechanical impacts from hydrate dissociation. The macro scale behavior of sediments during production operations, such as particle migration, fluid flow, and deformation behavior, is governed by particle characteristics, fabric formation environments, and the resulting fabrics. The geotechnical terms for characterizing the grain size distribution are useful tools for estimating geotechnical parameters in the absence of an extensive set of the geotechnical laboratory experiments. In this manuscript, the grain size distributions of sediments from the Ulleung Basin will be utilized to characterize geomechanical behaviors induced by the production operations at gas hydrate-bearing sites in the Ulleung Basin, where pore-filling GH have been found in the intercalated turbidite sands. According to the analyses on the grain size distributions, the particle migration in coarse grained layers during production necessitates proper measure for sand productions, while fine grained layers are mostly self-filtering. The hydraulic conductivity in pore-filling gas hydrate-bearing layers is relatively low in comparison with those from conventional gas reservoirs, and the conductivities at layers above GH layers are low enough to function as barriers.|","production, gas hydrate, geotechnical"

The 4D approach relies upon the use of 3D seismic data acquired at different times over the same area to assess changes in temperature, geomechanical effect, pressure effect, water injection, gas injection, and natural depletion, all these effects inducing density and velocity changes. Nearly thirty years on from its first beginnings, 4D  or time-lapse  seismic monitoring has now come of age as a proven technology, and is classically applied to monitor fluid movement and differentiating between drained and undrained portions of a reservoir. It is now possible to quantitatively monitor pressure injection signals, pressure depletion (compaction) signals, and in many cases, accurately separate the effect of pressure changes and saturation changes. Such changes within the reservoir may impact the whole sedimentary column up to the seabed (i.e. the overburden section). In addition, subsea installations may impact the seabed and the very shallow geology by in situ modification of the geomechanical parameters. With proper quality control during acquisition and processing, it is expected that 4D dataset would provide significant insight regarding the evolution of the seabed and shallow sub-seabed between the exploration phase, the start-up and the production phases.|","4D seismic, seabed monitoring"

The potential existence of methane hydrate deposits in the Ulleung Basin of the Korean East Sea was suggested by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources between 2000 and 2004 and a pilot production project is planned for 2015 as the world's second offshore hydrate production project. The basin has a water depth of 1500-2300 m; however, the depth of the hydrate occurrence zone is relatively shallow (about 100-200 MBSF) for gas hydrate production. There is high potential for geomechanical stability problems such as marine landslides, seafloor subsidence, and wellbore instability. In this study, 2D axisymmetric numerical modeling is conducted to simulate gas hydrate production from the Ulleung basin by depressurization. The simulation incorporates the physical processes of hydrate dissociation, the pore fluid flow and the geomechanical response of hydrate-bearing sediments. During depressurization, deformation of sediments around a production well is generated by the pore pressure difference in the depressurized and dissociation region. This tendency becomes more pronounced due to a stiffness decrease of hydrate-bearing sediments caused by hydrate dissociation.|","Methane hydrate, Depressurization, Ulleung basin, Numerical modeling, FDM"

For gas hydrate production, gas hydrate-bearing sediments should be depressurized below the gas hydrate equilibrium pressure. Gas hydrate-bearing sediments are compacted during the depressurization process because additional effective stress evolves due to a decrease in pore pressure. The compaction of a gas hydrate reservoir can lead to several geotechnical problems such as the destabilization of the production well, settlement of the seafloor installation, or slope failure of the production site. Thus, it is important to determine the compression characteristics of gas hydrate-bearing sediments and the geotechnical behavior of gas hydrate-bearing sediments during the gas hydrate dissociation induced by the depressurization. In this study, gas hydrates were synthesized in remolded sediment samples that were originally cored from a hydrate occurrence region in the Ulleung Basin, the East Sea, offshore Korea. The volumetric strain (or change of void ratio) of gas hydrate-bearing sediment samples were measured for different gas hydrate saturations and under different vertical effective stresses. The experimental results reveal the relation between compression (or the slope of a normal consolidation line) of gas hydrate-bearing sediments and gas hydrate saturation. Experimental data for compression indices of gas hydrate-bearing sediments can be applied to numerical modeling for a geotechnical stability analysis of gas hydrate-bearing sediments.|","Compression index, Volume change, Gas hydrate-bearing sediment"

This paper compares results of a deepwater geotechnical investigation using a seafloor drilling system, large-diameter core samples, and cone penetration tests performed from a coring vessel with results of a geotechnical investigation performed from a conventional drillship. The paper reports the first use of a seafloor drilling unit in the Gulf of Mexico to conduct a geotechnical site investigation for the mooring design of a floating platform. 
Common practice in the Gulf of Mexico for geotechnical investigations of anchor spreads for moored production facilities has been to perform seafloor cone penetration tests and to drill and sample one or more soil borings. ""Soil borings"" are prescribed but not defined by 30 CFR 250.19 API RP 2SK1 recognizes currently available site investigation tools, such as large-diameter core samples, that could be used in lieu of rotary soil borings; however, some certified verification authorities/agents (CVAs) have been reluctant to accept the use of API-accepted methods of site investigations in the Gulf of Mexico. Seafloor drilling units have been used successfully in various parts of the world, and cone penetration tests from a coring vessel have been performed and studied at numerous sites, both in the Gulf of Mexico and worldwide. This paper demonstrates that a seafloor drilling unit, large-diameter cores, and coring-vessel-deployed cone penetration tests integrated with AUV subbottom profile data can be used in the Gulf of Mexico without reliance on samples obtained from a drillship. 
Cone penetration resistance is compared using different cone systems and deployment methods at nearby locations. Results are essentially identical. Representative soil sample data are compared, and geotechnical laboratory test results are very similar. The paper confirms that when ASTM standards for cone testing and thin-walled-tube sampling are used, consistent results can be obtained from site investigations performed from seafloor drilling units and coring vessels or purpose-built geotechnical drillships. Integrated site investigation programs using technologies such as seafloor drilling units, large diameter coring, and cone penetration testing from a coring vessel should be acceptable for site investigations without special regulatory approvals beyond those that would apply to a site investigation program performed from a purpose-built geotechnical drillship.|","Seafloor drill, CPT"

This paper describes and explores the effects of geotechnical variability and uncertainty on the design of pipelines for thermal buckling and axial walking. Geotechnical input parameters  friction factors  are often assigned extremely wide ranges between low estimates (LE) and high estimates (HE), and these are assumed to apply uniformly along the pipeline in some design steps, or handled probabilistically in others. This paper clarifies the causes of geotechnical variability and uncertainty, identifying effects that are aleatory and epistemic. It proves useful to distinguish these effects on the basis of local and global influences that relate to short parts of the pipeline and the entire pipeline respectively. 
Field data from a case study pipeline is used to demonstrate these sources of PSI parameter variability and uncertainty. The aleatory (local) variability generally relates to the lay process and the resulting influence on the local soil strength and pipe embedment, and can also arise from in situ geotechnical heterogeneity. Epistemic (global) uncertainty relates to potential systematic errors in the assessment of soil strength and the average influence of the lay process. The epistemic (global) uncertainty budget also includes uncertainty related to the calculation models used to determine PSI parameters from soil properties, including their applicability for the site in question. 
Pipeline buckling design generally involves two types of analysis: (1) probabilistic analysis of buckle initiation (and tolerability), usually using a Monte Carlo approach, e.g. using the BUCKFAST software; (2) deterministic analysis of buckling, usually using finite element analysis. In the probabilistic analysis the full PSI LE-HE range is considered in each Monte Carlo realization, meaning the range is implicitly treated as aleatory (local). In the deterministic (FE) analysis a single set of PSI parameters are applied uniformly along the pipe meaning that the range is implicitly treated as epistemic (global). 
This study compares the calculated and observed as-laid embedment of the case study pipeline and shows the resulting range of lateral breakout and residual resistance. These parameters are calculated by a Monte Carlo method that yields the covariation of these parameters and forms a useful tool for design. Buckles tend to form at locations of low embedment and therefore low lateral breakout resistance which also have low residual lateral resistance, and can therefore tolerate higher feed-in. Conventional design practice treats initiation and tolerability as independent calculations, which is unnecessarily onerous. 
The influence of aleatory (local) variability is then explored using the lateral PSI parameters derived for the case study pipeline. FE analyses are firstly performed using LE, BE and HE lateral resistance applied uniformly along the pipe (mirroring conventional design practice). An additional analysis then uses the real spatial variation in lateral resistance calculated directly from the embedment survey data. It is shown that the real pipeline buckles at short (~2040 m long) regions of local low lateral resistance. As these buckles lengthen, they experience a higher average lateral resistance. However, the resulting strains are significantly lower than calculated from the uniform HE friction case that is conventionally considered in design. 
These observations provide impetus for a more sophisticated treatment of geotechnical uncertainty and variability in pipeline buckling design. Current methods appear too onerous in some (but not all) respects. This paper provides techniques to reduce unnecessary conservatism, and to allow better definition and handling of geotechnical uncertainty and variability.|","Pipeline, Buckling, Walking, Variability, Geotechnical"

We study the system response at two time scales: a short period (< 20 days) that corresponds to the duration of the planned field test, and a prolonged production period that continues to the point of hydrate exhaustion and/or reservoir abandonment. The data describing the geologic model and the system properties were obtained from earlier geophysical studies and the analysis of cores obtained from experimental wells at several locations in the Ulleung Basin. Gas hydrate accumulations at this site typically occur in deep water (over 2000 m) but close to the ocean floor (with their tops at less than 200 mbsf), and are usually characterized by alternating mud (nearly hydrate-free) and sand (hydrate-rich) layers. The layered stratigraphy and the presence of mud layers preclude the use of horizontal wells and necessitate vertical wells. The analysis of the short-term production tests focuses on the expected gas production rate and the possibility of subsidence during the limited time of the planned test. The long-term study aims to address the issue of feasibility of long-term production from the hydrates at the test site in terms of production rates and the geomechanical stability of the well assembly and of the reservoir. We investigate several well configurations and their operation characteristics, as well as various dissociation strategies. We evaluate the sensitivity of the system to various flow, thermal, and geomechanical properties (porosity, permeability, thermal conductivity, specific heat, Poissons ratio, initial stress distribution, mechanical strength, etc.) and their spatial distribution (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous systems, including considerations of spatially correlated statistical heterogeneity), and we investigate the interdependence of flow and geomechanical properties. We estimate possible subsidence of HBS under production, the effect of the sediment texture on compaction, and we determine the conditions that have the potential to lead to wellbore and formation failure, thus defining the envelope of well operations and production conditions that maximize safe gas production.|","production, geomechanics, field test, hydrates"

Reservoir Eocene C/VLG-3676 of Ceuta field, one of the major reservoirs in Maracaibo lake basin, is characterized by operational challenges that prevent its optimal production. Drilling is challenging and requires large mud-weights to reach target. In order to optimize drilling and completion operations, a geomechanical study was launched to develop a Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) and use it to improve well trajectory, mud-weight programs, and perforation strategies. The methodology followed when developing this MEM was: 1) data audit and well selection; 2) tectonics and structural-setting analysis; 3) drilling-event analysis; 4) mechanical-stratigraphy definition; 5) rock-property evaluation; 6) pore-pressure estimation; 7) in-situ stress determination; 8) wellbore-stability evaluation; 9) mud-weight window determination; and 10) optimal well trajectory computation. The three most interesting features of this paper are: 1) the analysis of more than 200 tests performed in laboratory on Eocene ""C"" cores that shows a very high degree of damage of the cored material; 2) a new in-situ stress field determination method based on tectonic deformation theory; and 3) a stress regime that changes from normal in the Miocene at shallow depths (2005000'), to strike-slip and reverse in the Eocene at depths greater than 10,000'.

The hostile and remote subsea environment has imposed significant technical challenges on the electrical system. Due to the extremely limited accessibility, the electrical system needs to be very reliable and require minimum regular maintenance in its lifetime. The system should be able to detect and isolate local faults without shutting down the whole system in order to maximize the availability and avoid unplanned stops. The electrical system should also be as compact as possible and modularized, so that they can be installed and retrieved without heavy vessels and lifts which have very limited availability.

In order to design unburied pipelines, pipeline engineers require information about lateral and axial seabed resistances (normally known as friction factors) prior to and during operation. Geotechnical engineers must provide this information based on knowledge of pipeline properties, seabed conditions and metocean conditions.

This paper discusses how pipeline embedments and geometries can change from the as-laid state as the result of sediment mobility around pipelines and demonstrates how these embedment changes will change the pipe-soil friction factors using a series of numerical analyses. Sediment mobility tends to cause a general trend of increasing pipe embedment, which is beneficial for hydrodynamic stability but can be onerous for thermal buckling.

This paper is concerned with the friction and sliding resistance that can be mobilised on the unusual carbonate sediments prevalent across many parts of the world, including Offshore Australia. Physical centrifuge model testing was conducted to evaluate the axial pipe-soil resistance on a soil obtained from the North West Shelf, offshore Australia. Tests were performed at a range of speeds, spanning drained/undrained conditions, interspersed with consolidation periods. The resulting axial friction factors are generally higher than is often assumed in conventional design practice for pipeline end expansion or buckling and walking analysis, which is consistent with the high friction angles and dilatancy of these angular carbonate soils. In addition, the results demonstrate the effect that soil drainage response and history of pipeline sliding movements can have on the axial-pipe friction. Overall, the results highlight the importance of making site-specific assessments of seabed sliding resistance, rather than rely on non-site-specific results (particularly from different regions) that may display a very different soil response.

This paper summarizes key results of the development and verification for a subsea compact separation control system based upon a literature review, control system design, dynamic simulations, and an integrated system test. The compact separation system being considered is designed for applications in water depths up to 3,000m. The control system is a key technology element of the compact separation system, and its satisfactory performance is critical to ensure stable operation of the overall system. A thorough literature review was conducted to evaluate the control system designs for comparable subsea separation systems in industry, to understand the technical challenges, and to incorporate the key learnings into the development of this control system design. 
From this work, best practices were identified and were used as guidelines. A preliminary control system was developed, and the robustness of its design was assessed through dynamic simulations. Later, an integrated system test was performed with real crude and methane at realistic operating conditions to evaluate the performance of the compact separation equipment and to validate the model of the control system. The dynamic simulations and integrated system test results demonstrated the control system response following transient events, such as slugging, and provided insight into the system dynamics that then led to further modifications of the control system design and enhanced the overall system performance. 
This paper also delineates challenges associated with the design of a control system for a subsea compact separation system consisting of multiple, closely integrated gas-liquid and oil-water separation units. For example, the relatively small control volumes in compact separation equipment and the interaction between the different components can both add complexity to the control system design.

Physical centrifuge model testing has been performed on 3 soils. The paper will show that higher sliding resistance can often be mobilised on these soils, compared to the soft clays and sands found in other regions. Application: The two principal applications of this discovery are (i) the axial resistance of seabed pipelines, in relation to stability and buckling/walking design, and to (ii) the sliding resistance of surface foundations, including temporary clump weights or PLETs. Results, Observations, and Conclusions: The results include new measurements of sliding resistance of pipelines and shallow penetrometers. Sliding events were performed at a range of speeds, spanning drained/undrained conditions, interspersed with consolidation periods. The sequences capture the changing resistance as the failing soil approaches the critical state. Overall, the research shows that the axial friction factors applicable to pipeline end expansion or buckling/walking analysis are generally higher than is often assumed in conventional design practice. This is consistent with the high friction angles and dilatancy of these angular carbonate soils. The implication of this research is that walking rates of pipelines on carbonate soils will generally be slower than on other soils. However, the corollary is that the effective force that will be mobilised at restraining points during shutdowns can be higher. Novel penetrometers allow these characteristics to be identified, and emerging designs and deployment techniques for these penetrometers are described.Significance of Subject Matter: The significance of this paper is as follows:(1) It provides new data on seabed sliding resistance in relation to pipeline and surface foundations, filling a gap associated with the unusual carbonate soils prevalent in this region. (2) It describes a theoretical framework to interpret this data, to allow in-situ and laboratory tests to be applied in design. (3) It opens up opportunities for more efficient and reliable design, taking advantage of these newly-identified characteristics of seabed sliding resistance.  |","Site Investigation, Pipeline, Foundation, Seabed strength, Friction"

Japan Oil, Gas, and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) conducted the first offshore methane hydrate production trial on March 2013, in the eastern Nankai Trough, Japan. Field work for the gas production trial began in early 2012. Coring and logging operations were conducted to prepare for the gas hydrate production trial. On March 12th, 2013, JOGMEC succeeded in extracting methane gas from the hydrate-bearing sediments by the depressurization method and approximately 120, 000 cubic meters of methane gas were produced totally. The production finally terminated due to the increase in sand production. It indicates the importance of evaluation the state of wellbore in order to produce methane gas safety and efficiently. It calls for an analysis to predict the stress changes and plastic strain evolution of wellbore during the life of well. Hence, a wellbore model, specifically designed for methane gas production, is necessary to assess the potential risks associated with the construction and production stage. 
This paper describes a finite element approach, which mainly takes into account of (a) all the typical processes associated with wellbore construction and gas production and (b) the interaction between cement-casing-formation. Based on this approach, a finite element model, which includes the layered soil profile, cement, casing, gravel and sand screen, was developed in ABAQUS to simulate the gas production trial at East Nankai Trough in March, 2013. The Methane Hydrate Critical State (MHCS) model (Uchida et al., 2012), which was developed to simulate the geomechanical response of the methane hydrate bearing sediment, was incorporated into this finite element model. It presents results of coupled ground deformation and pore fluid flow analysis of a gas production wellbore from a methane hydrate formation. The study focused on the short- and long-term mechanical behaviour of the critical physical components at and near the wellbore by simulating the construction processes of the wellbore as well as the production stage. The interaction between cement-casing-formation was examined in detail.|","numerical analysis, methane hydrate, wellbore"

We investigate by means of numerical simulation the coupled flow and geomechanical system behavior during gas production from an oceanic hydrate accumulation at the site of a planned field test at the Ulleung basin in the Korean East Sea. We study the system response at two time scales: a short period (14 days) that corresponds to the duration of the planned field test, and a prolonged production period that continues to the point of hydrate exhaustion and/or reservoir abandonment. The data describing the geologic model and the system properties were obtained from earlier geophysical studies and the analysis of cores obtained from experimental wells at several locations in the Ulleung Basin. Gas hydrate accumulations at this site typically occur in deep water (2157 m) but close to the ocean floor (with their tops 140 mbsf), and are usually characterized by alternating mud (nearly hydrate-free) and sand (hydrate-rich) layers. The layered stratigraphy and the presence of mud layers preclude the use of horizontal wells and necessitate vertical wells. The analysis of the short-term production tests focuses on the expected gas production rate and the possibility of subsidence during the limited time of the planned test. The long-term study aims to address the issue of feasibility of long-term production from the hydrates at the test site in terms of production rates and the geomechanical stability of the well assembly and of the reservoir. We investigate several well operation regimes. We evaluate the sensitivity of the system to various flow, thermal, and geomechanical properties, and we account for the interdependence of flow and geomechanical properties. We estimate possible subsidence under production and we determine the conditions that have the potential to lead to wellbore and formation failure, thus defining the envelope of well operations and production conditions that maximize safe gas production.|","production, field test, geomechanics, hydrates"

Many drilling risks are met during exploration and evaluation stage in South China Sea, China. The narrow mud weight window and presence of high pressure formation are two main challenges in this area. Generally, geomechanics study will be carried out using information obtained from nearby wells together with the surface seismic data before drilling the well. Sonic measurement is one of the most important input data in the geomechanics analysis to provide an estimate for mud weight window and drilling risks evaluation. What's more, the real-time LWD sonic is critical to improve the accuracy of the safe mud window by calibrating the initial geomechanics model to reduce the associated drilling risks. The real-time LWD sonic data together with the pre-drill geomechanics model calibration is our solution for those challenges. 
Based on our experience, the former LWD sonic tool delivers good memory data but the real-time data quality is not very consistent depending on drilling noise, borehole condition, formation properties as well as other operation restrictions. In such cases, the sonic memory data was used to calibrate the mechanical earth model, the updated model will then be used as reference to drill the subsequence well. However, with unstable real-time sonic data makes it difficult to perform real-time evaluation. 
Having a reliable real-time sonic measurement is very important for offshore operation, especially in High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) environment to reduce the drilling risks and save rig time. It is vital to get good quality and accurate real-time sonic data to meet our requirements. With the latest LWD sonic tool, good quality of LWD sonic data was obtained for both real-time and memory. The real-time slowness acquired matches the memory slowness very well which give us more confidence to perform real-time geomechanics analysis in the coming HPHT deep water project. 
This paper focuses on data quality comparison between the two generation of LWD sonic tools tested in this area, challenges and methodology in real-time data quality control as well as the applicability of the LWD sonic in South China Sea. With the confidence of the real-time measurement data quality shown in these examples, this will significantly reduce the drilling risks in our next HPHT project. This assurance also enables us to explore additional applications in our projects.|","High real-time data quality, LWD sonic, Reduce drilling risk, South China Sea"

Between 2009 and 2013, a tandem offloading system using floating cryogenic flexible hoses developed and qualified to be able to transfer LNG in open seas. This arrangement was selected in order to combine the safety and the availability brought by the tandem configuration with the wide operational envelope provided by the use of floating hoses. |This system is composed of an innovative and compact hose storage system on the LNG Terminal allowing to store the hoses between two offloading operations, of a connection head (hose end termination piece) to ease the deployment/retrieval of the hoses and of a storage and maintenance platform for the connection head at the aft of the LNG Terminal, also allowing to replace a hose section in offshore conditions. On the LNG Carrier side, a bow loading platform is installed to ensure hoses connection even in exposed environmental conditions. The 20"" ID cryogenic floating hoses to be used with this system has been developed and qualified in parallel with the development of the tandem system. |A red line for this development was to keep a similar level of safety, integrity and performance to onshore offloading operations. To fulfill this requirement, simple, robust and proven technologies have been considered for the main items of the system. The system incorporates a comprehensive panel of safety layers through monitoring, hardware, procedures and control philosophy providing protection for people and material during all steps of the offloading sequence. Regarding the performance, the system can transfer LNG at a flowrate of 10, 000 to 12, 000 m3/h using three hoses, which gives redundancy to transfer LNG even with one hose unavailable. To offer a high availability, dedicated solutions have been implemented in the system to withstand sea states with Hs up to 3.5 m for hoses connection and 4 m for cargo transfer and hoses disconnection. |This solution will help unlocking offshore stranded gas resources in many areas around the world through FLNG development.|","Offloading, LNG, hose, floating, Tandem"

The classical concept of hydraulic fracturing is that a single, planar, opening mode fracture propagates through the formation. In recent years, there has been a growing consensus that natural fractures play an important role during stimulation in many settings.There is not universal agreement on the mechanisms by which natural fractures affect stimulation, and these mechanisms may vary depending on formation properties. One potentially important mechanism is shear stimulation, in which increased fluid pressure induces slip and permeability enhancement on pre-existing fractures. We propose a tendency-for-shear-stimulation (TSS) test as a direct, relatively unambiguous method for determining the degree to which shear stimulation contributes to stimulation in a formation. In a TSS test, fluid injection is performed while maintaining the bottomhole fluid pressure slightly less than the minimum principal stress. Under these conditions, shear stimulation is the only possible mechanism for permeability enhancement (except, perhaps, thermally induced tensile fracturing). A TSS test is different from a conventional procedure because injection is performed at a specified pressure (rather than a specified rate).With injection at a specified rate, fluid pressure may exceed the minimum principal stress, and it may cause tensile fractures to propagate through the formation. If this occurs, it will be ambiguouswhether stimulation was because of shear stimulation or tensile fracturing. Maintaining pressure less than the minimum principal stress ensures that the effect of shear stimulation can be isolated. Low-rate injectivity tests could be performed before and after the TSS test to estimate formation permeability. An increase in formation permeability would indicate that shear stimulation has occurred. The flow-rate transient during injection may also be interpreted to identify shear stimulation. Numerical simulations of shear stimulation were performed with a discrete-fracture-network (DFN) simulator that couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation. These simulations were used to qualitatively investigate how shear stimulation and fracture connectivity affect the results of a TSS test. Two specific field projects are discussed as examples of a TSS test, the Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) projects at Desert Peak, Nevada, and Soultz-sous-Forets, France.|","gas shale, geothermal, well testing, shear stimulation, hydraulic fracturing"

Unconventional gas is stored in extensive areas known as basin centered continuous-gas accumulations. Although the estimated worldwide figures differ significantly, the consensus among the studies relating to unconventional gas resources is that the volumes are gigantic. However, the low permeability in these types of reservoirs usually results in a very low recovery factor.To help unlock these resources, this paper presents a new and more accurate way of simulating multistage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells in three dimensions by use of single- and dual-porosity reservoir models. In this approach, the geometry (not necessarily symmetric) and orientation of the multiple hydraulic fractures are driven by the prevailing stress state in the drainage volume of the horizontal well. Once the hydraulic-fracturing job is accurately modeled in three dimensions, two-way geomechanical coupling is used to history match the produced gas from a horizontal well drilled in the Nikanassin naturally fractured tight gas formation of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Traditionally, the most widely used approaches have their roots in semianalytical calculations simplifying the fracturing system to a planar feature propagating symmetrically away from a line source of injection. In contrast, the computed results presented in this study show that the incorporation of geomechanical effects gives a more realistic representation of the orientation and geometry of hydraulic fractures. Reduction in permeability of the natural and hydraulic fractures because of pressure depletion results in more-realistic production predictions compared with the case in which geomechanical effects are ignored. The telling conclusion, in light of the computed results, is that the field of hydraulic fracturing provides an object lesson in the need for coupled 3D geomechanical approaches. The method presented in this paper will help to improve gas rates and recoveries from reservoirs with permeability values in the nanodarcy scale.|","coupled geomechanics, fluid flow simulation"

This work introduces a new model for the production-decline analysis (PDA) of hydraulically fractured wells on the basis of the concept of the induced permeability field. We consider the case when the hydraulic-fracturing operation--in addition to establishing the fundamental linear-flow geometry in the drainage volume--alters the ability of the formation to conduct fluids throughout, but with varying degrees depending on the distance from the main fracture plane. We show that, under these circumstances, the reservoir response departs from the uniform-permeability approach significantly. The new model differs from the once promising group of models that are inherently related to power-law-type variation of the permeability-area product and thus are burdened by a mathematical singularity inside the fracture. The analysis of field cases reveals that the induced permeability field can be properly represented by a linear or exponential function characterized by the maximal induced permeability k0 and the threshold permeability k*. Both these permeabilities are induced (superimposed on the formation) by the hydraulic-fracturing treatment; thus, the model can be considered as a simple, but nontrivial, formalization of the intuitive stimulated-reservoir-volume (SRV) concept. It is quite reasonable to assume that the maximum happens at the fracture face and that the minimum happens at the outer boundary of the SRV. The contrast between maximal and minimal permeability, SR-1/4-k0/k*, will be of considerable interest, and thus, we introduce a new term for it: stimulation ratio (SR). Knowledge of these parameters is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of todays intensively stimulated well completions, especially multifractured horizontal wells in shale gas. The approach describes, in a straightforward manner, the production performance of such wells exhibiting transient linear flow and late-time boundary-dominated flow affected also by a skin effect (i.e., by an additional pressure drop in the system characterized by linear dependence on production rate). This work provides the induced-permeability-field model within the single-medium concept, and shows that some features widely believed to require a dual-medium (double-porosity) representation are already present. Advantages and drawbacks related to applying the concept in a dual-medium approach will be discussed in an upcoming work. We present the model and its analytical solution in Laplace space. We provide type curves for decline-curve analysis, closed-form approximate solutions in the time domain, field examples, and practical guidelines for the analysis of commonly occurring production characteristics of massively stimulated reservoirs.|","exponential or linear permeability field, skin factor, maximum and minimum induced permeabilities, hydraulically fractured well, decline curve analysis"

In 2009, QGC (a BG Group company), began developing coal-seam-gas (CSG) feedstock for its new liquefied-natural-gas (LNG) plant and required a subsurface model and field-development plan to underpin the investment case for the project. Fundamental to the modeling process was acquiring appropriate data to calibrate subsurface models and enhance confidence in their predictive quality. As part of an integrated reservoir-surveillance strategy, specific pressure- and temperature-monitoring wells were required. This paper describes the successful laboratory and field implementation of an innovative completion technique that converts suspended coreholes into reservoir- and aquifer-monitoring wells. The coreholes are re-entered, and vibrating wire piezometers attached to capillary coiled tubing are positioned and cemented in place alongside selected reservoir intervals. The well is then plugged and abandoned and the lease remediated to leave only a small surface footprint for the data logger and telemetry. The cement is effectively impermeable to fluid movement, but possesses sufficient permeability to transmit reservoir pore pressure to an adjacent piezometer. Recompletion of coreholes provides a cost-effective means of acquiring valuable downhole data while eliminating the need to drill a well specifically for monitoring in the same vicinity. Data gathered over the reservoir interval (the Walloon Coal Measures) can inform and help resolve reservoir properties on a regional scale, enhance understanding of the contribution to flow, and provide data points to pressure match a reservoir model. Data gathered over the aquifers within Springbok sandstone and Gubbermunda sandstone enable estimates of any CSG-production effects on groundwater.|","Pressure gauge, Reservoir surveillance, Coal Seam Gas, Completion"

At the nanoscale; size does matter when it comes to how molecules react to and bond with each other. |The filter cake developed during nanoparticles-based drilling fluid filtration is very thin, which implies high potential for reducing the differential pressure sticking problem and formation damage while drilling. |While drilling shales formations with nanodarcy (nD) permeability,  Nanoparticles can be added to the drilling fluids to minimize shale permeability through physically plugging the nanosized pores and suppress the pressure transmission, hence Nanotechnology can provide a potential solution for environmentally sensitive areas where oil-based mud (OBM) historically used as a solution to stabilize shales.  |Geotechnical challenges normally increase with increasing well inclination due to the highly faulted nature of many of the formations. Pressures and temperatures are typically not excessive but the complex interlayering of shales, sandstones siltstones and limestones results in multiple problems associated with borehole instability. |The Paper will reveal all lab work and field procedures for new Nanotechnology additive for wells that have an intercalated lithologies and tight reservoirs.

Major operator is drilling in an exploratory field, located in East Jordan, targeting sandstone reservoir approximately 2,600 m below the surface. Historically, the operator drilled these underbalanced wells with conventional roller-cone and polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits. The drilling project included a 26-in. hole through a tough and highly interbedded formation of mudstone, sandstone and siltstone down to depth of 1,350 m. Inconsistent drilling performance of PDC bits resulted in short run intervals with poor dull conditions. The roller-cone bits also inconsistently drilled the entire interval, achieving slow penetration rates with short runs. 
Thorough in-depth engineering analysis of all available data including rock strength, bit dull, bottomhole assembly, drilling parameters and downhole vibrations, identified the possible root causes for this poor performance and led to a new 26-in. hybrid bit design to overcome the drilling challenges and improve the overall drilling efficiency. 
The 26-in. hybrid bit technology with combined elements of PDC bits and tungsten carbide inserts (TCI) was deployed.  This combination overcame the drilling challenges in this application and achieved all the operator objectives by drilling the entire 26-in. hole in one run, replacing three bits used to drill the same interval in the offset well, saving five rig days over the planned AFE drilling days. 
This paper provides a detailed description of the operational challenges in this application. It then introduces the concept of the new hybrid bit design and provides recommendations based on the performance achieved. After a description of the implementation and operation execution of drilling 26-in. hole in this challenging application, the paper concludes with a discussion of the benefits and value added to the operator by the deployment of this new design approach, highlighting the reduction in number of trips for bit changes.|","Document Type

Shale is a wide variety of rocks that are composed of extremely fine-grained particles with very small porosity and permeability values in the order of few porosity units and nano-darcy range, respectively. Shale formations are very complex at the core scale, and exhibit large vertical variations in lithology and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) at a small scale that renders core characterization and sweet spot detection very challenging. Shale formations are also very complex at the nano-scale pore level where the pores have different porosity types that are detected within the kerogen volume. These complexities led to further research and development of advanced application of high resolution X-ray CT scanning on full diameter core sections to characterize shale mineralogy, porosity and rock facies so that accurate evaluation of the sweet spot locations could be made for further detailed petrophysical and petrographic studies. |In this work, argillaceous shale gas cores were imaged using high resolution dual energy X-ray CT scanning. This imaging technique produces continuous whole core scans at 0.5mm spacing and derives accurate bulk density and effective atomic number (Zeff) logs along the core intervals which were crucial in determining lithology, porosity, and rock facies. Additionally, integrated XRD data and energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) analysis were acquired to confirm the mineral framework composition of the core. Smaller core plugs and subsamples representing the main variations in the core were extracted for much higher resolution X-ray CT scanning and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis. Porosity was mainly found in organic matter and was determined from 2D and 3D SEM images by image segmentation process. Horizontal fluid flow was only possible through the organic matter and the simulations of 3D FIB-SEM volumes by solving Stokes equation using Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). |A clear trend was observed between porosity and permeability while correlating with identified facies in the core. Silica-rich facies gave higher Phie-K characteristics compared to the low clay-rich facies. This is mainly caused by pressure compaction effect in the soft clay-rich samples. High percentages of organic matter were not found to be good indication for high porosity or permeability in the clay-rich shale samples. The depositional facies was found to have great effect on the pore types, rock fabric and reservoir properties. The results and interpretations entailed in this study provide further insights and enhance our understanding of heterogeneity of the organic rich shale reservoir rock.|",""

To succeed, this completion strategy must be complemented with good understanding on petrophysical and geomechanical properties of the reservoir; which resulted in a better understanding of fracture orientation and decisions on open hole length, number of fracturing stages, packers and frac ports placement.  |When dealing with a low permeability environment, for a specific open hole length, it is almost certain that increasing the number of fracturing stages will potentially give the highest productivity. Subsequently, this will also potentially increase the chance of having packer integrity issues due to the shorter distance between the frac port and packers. |Currently, the most common practice to evaluate packer integrity is done on-site, by comparing pressure response at a constant injection rate before and after opening a frac port, in addition to observing breakdown and closure pressure for each compartment. In the event of similar pressure response on both sides, it may be an indication of communication. Consequently, relying only on this injection exclusively is not sufficient because the leak-off profiles may suggest otherwise and could lead to drawing the wrong conclusions. |This paper describes a new enhancement of the mini fall off (MFO) injections procedure, which can be used to confirm multistage fracturing packers integrity on-site.

Advancements in horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing have enabled commercial oil production from Bakken tight oil reservoirs. However, the primary recovery factor remains very low (less than 15%), resulting in the high volume of oil remaining in place. Hence, it is extremely important to investigate the application of enhanced oil recovery methods. Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection as a huff-n-puff process is a preferred approach to improve oil recovery in tight reservoirs. In this work, we present the effect of CO2 molecular diffusion and performed a series of sensitivity studies to quantify the impacts of reservoir properties such as permeability and fracture properties such as fracture half-length, fracture conductivity, number of fractures, and operation parameters such as CO2 injection rate, injection time, soaking time, number of cycle of CO2 huff-n-puff and CO2 diffusivity on the CO2 huff-n-puff process for enhanced oil recovery in the Bakken Formation. 
A numerical model was built using the typical reservoir and fracture properties from Middle Bakken to simulate CO2 huff-n-puff process. In this process, we consider CO2 molecular diffusion term to swell oil in matrix since Darcy velocity is negligible due to low permeability. The numerical model was validated with field production data from a horizontal well in Middle Bakken. Based on the history matching results, the relative permeability curves such as water-oil relative permeability and liquid-gas relative permeability, are obtained. Furthermore, the wettability for the Middle Bakken is found to be weak water wet. Simulation results show that the most important parameter is CO2 injection rate, followed by CO2 injection time, number of cycle, CO2 diffusivity. The other parameters such as fracture conductivity, CO2 soaking time, permeability and fracture half-length are less sensitive based on the range investigated in this study. The range for the incremental oil recovery factor at 30 years of production is obtained as 2.5% - 9.4%. This work can provide fundamental understanding of the key parameters controlling the CO2 huff-n-puff process for enhanced oil recovery in the Bakken Formation.|","Bakken, Sensitivity study, Hydraulic fracturing, CO2 Huff-n-Puff, Molecular diffusion"

The experiments were performed in a high pressure single PDC cutter testing facility which is designed to perform one round of cut on the test rock sample with a single PDC cutter. The cell confining pressure and the pore pressure were controlled and other operating conditions such as the depth of the cut and rotary speed were kept relatively constant. The results can be applied to equip PDC bit simulators with better bit performance prediction by considering the effect of the formation pore pressure in the model. Such knowledge improves the drilling optimization analysis by providing more accurate predictive guidelines. The methods used and the lessons learned in these experimental investigations can be modified and utilized in more advanced similar types of investigations. The results show that the lack of the pore pressure can increase the MSE by at least 15%. These experimental data were used in production of well-fitting correlations of logarithmic nature relating the MSE to the differential pressure and the confining pressure. The same type of behavior, but to a lower extent, was observed when the drilling strength was considered; for instance, the extent to which the drilling strength increases due to the lack of the pore pressure is about 10% for these tests. According to a former analytical study, these tests were performed in a high speed regime in which the MSE is independent of the pore pressure. The test results do not support this conclusion; possible reasons including an overestimation of the rock shear dilatancy in that study are investigated. This study adds up to the rock mechanics knowledge of the PDC bit cutting action by proposing a quantitative means to account for the effect of the pore pressure. The results can not only be used to enhance the accuracy of any type of PDC bit simulator; but also, to test or validate rock failure models that consider the pore pressure.|","Pore Pressure, MSE, PDC, Drilling Strength"

Similar permeability increases are seen in other CBM basins around the world. Models previously advanced to explain this behavior combine a compaction mechanism (which closes cleats) with matrix shrinkage (which opens cleats). In this paper, one of the original models (Palmer- Mansoori model) is extended to include the transversely isotropic elastic response found in vertically cleated coals. This new version of the model has been calibrated by laboratory measurements on San Juan Basin coal loaded under uniaxial-strain conditions to simulate reservoir depletion. The result is a predictive model characterized by two measured Youngs moduli and three measured Poissons ratios. We have been able to match observed permeability increases in San Juan Basin CBM wells using this anisotropic model and rock and reservoir parameters that are viable and consistent with independent constraints. Taking permeability data from wells in different parts of the San Juan basin, examples of permeability increase with depletion being matched by the new model illustrate the results. To our knowledge, a rigorous geomechanical analysis of anisotropic coal has not before been incorporated into efforts to match field data. The new model should allow better forecasting of gas rates by reservoir simulators, as well as improved predictions of gas production in fields yet to be developed.While there exist many models that seek to explain the huge permeability increases in coalbed methane wells, the significance of this logical extension to the Palmer-Mansoori model (i.e., the addition of coal anisotropy) is that it has the ability to predict permeability increases in field wells using measurable rock moduli and other quantities, thus reducing the need for empirically-derived field-matching parameters. Note that this new model confirms an empirical constant that was invoked in a previous version of the Palmer-Mansoori model to account for cleat anisotropy. The rigorous derivation, for anisotropic coal, of permeability increase during depletion provides a missing link (and a significant one) that will save modelers from invoking more esoteric (and unnecessary) factors to try to get a match to field data.|","Coalbed Methane, Permeability, Matrix Shrinkage"

This paper describes the application of a new robust workflow that uses a reservoir simulator and a new reservoir property called the Shale Capacity to estimate the actual SRV and the subsequent reserves resulting from the interaction between the fracing and the response of the reservoir. The actual SRV seems to be related mostly to the Shale Capacity defined as the product of four key shale drivers: Total Organic Content, Porosity, Brittleness, and Natural Fracture Density.  When producing a shale reservoir, it appears that the Relative Intercepted Shale Capacity (RISC), seems to have a strong correlation with the resulting actual SRV. Application: Actual SRV in shale reservoirs could be estimated with reasonable accuracy if the 3D shale capacity  model is used in a reservoir simulator to reproduce the well performance.  Additionally, the microseismic could be used to validate the derived actual SRV which is a subset of the microseismic SRV. Results, Observations, and Conclusions: This new robust workflow is illustrated with a Marcellus and Haynessvile case studies where the actual SRV was estimated using the shale capacity and microseismic events validated the areas where the well is actually draining from.

However, symmetric spacing designs assume homogeneous shale fracability, which may not be realistic in many shale plays. The efficiency of the fracturing process depends on the fracability or brittleness of the underlying shale rock. Therefore, there is a need for quantifying the heterogeneity in shale brittleness and using the results for optimizing the fracturing process, including the number, location, and length scale of the fractures. Shale fracability increases with its quartz content (with highly brittle behavior) and decreases with its clay content (with highly ductile behavior). Since gamma ray value is sensitive to the clay and quartz contents, it can be used to detect and map the fracability of shale formations. In general, the fracability of shale can vary in space and regions with low and high fracability can be present in a given shale play. The heterogeneity in the fracability is an important consideration in designing the hydraulic fracturing treatment and can be used to optimize fracture placement and staging. In this paper, we develop and discuss an optimization algorithm for fracture placement under variability in shale fracability. We apply a general optimization algorithm, known as Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), to optimize the fracture design in a shale formation with heterogeneous brittleness distribution throughout the reservoir. The optimization metric is the net present value, which includes the cost of fracturing and revenue from gas production. The proposed optimization framework provides a systematic effective hydraulic fracturing design and treatment for shale gas reservoirs. It can be applied as a rigorous tool for optimizing the hydraulic fracturing stages to improve gas recovery and reduce the cost and environmental impacts associated with hydraulic fracturing. We demonstrate the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed method with several numerical experiments in shale gas development.|","Hydraulic fracturing, Fracture spacing, Unconventional reservoir, Fracture length, Optimization"

Shale formations present anisotropic characteristics in mechanical, acoustic, and flow properties due to their layering and pre-existing natural fractures. This anisotropic behavior can create a complex fracture network rather than the conventionally presumed planar fractures. Although incorporating anisotropic behavior is essential for optimizing the hydraulic fracturing design and analyzing the post-fracture data, there are limited studies addressing the anisotropic tensile behavior of organic-rich shale formations. The objective of this study is to explore the tensile strength and tensile fracture patterns in shales by conducting splitting tests on variety of shale formations.

Having different types of Green River shale, the impact of TOC on the tensile strength was obtained. The anisotropic tensile behavior of Mancos and Green River shales were studied systematically at various orientations between the applied force and the bedding direction providing key understanding on the fracture growth patterns at any direction.

This implies knowledge of rock properties and pore pressure variations throughout the wellbore. These properties can be determined with a good level of certainty when complete data sets are available. In practice, however, data scarcity from horizontal wells is the rule rather than the exception. This has led in most instances to performing multi-stage hydraulic fracturing jobs in symmetric intervals throughout the horizontal well without regard to the optimum locations where hydraulic fractures should be initiated. This study shows how data extracted from drill cuttings collected in a horizontal well can be used for optimizing multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. The cuttings are used in the laboratory for measuring porosity and permeability and for estimating geomechanical properties (e.g. Young Modulus, Poissons ratio, brittleness index). The data permit generating the in-situ stress profile and pore pressure variations. A comparison is made of two cases in a horizontal well of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), where only a gamma ray log is available: In one case drill cuttings are used for estimating geomechanical properties to select fracture initiation zones; in the other case symmetric fracturing stages are selected without giving consideration to geomechanical properties. The conclusion is reached that the petrophysical and geomechanical knowledge acquired from the study of drill cuttings leads to better rates and improved ultimate recoveries.|","drill cuttings, petrophysics, horizontal well, multi-stage fracturing, geomechanics"

Parameter updates are constrained to the prior geologic heterogeneity and are performed parsimoniously, or only to spatial scales at which they can be resolved by the history data. In the first step of the workflow, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to calibrate and assess the uncertainty in global parameters (e.g., regional fracture properties, aquifer strength) that influence reservoir energy and field-scale flow behavior. To identify the reservoir volume over which each parameter region is applied, a novel heterogeneity segmentation is developed from spectral clustering theory. After an ensemble of calibrated model realizations is identified using the GA, the ensemble is reduced via a cluster analysis to define a variance-preserving subset of the members for the second step of local or high-resolution parameter calibration. Each member of the subset is calibrated to well-level phase rate and pressure data using a sensitivity-based scheme. To improve the ill-posedness of each high-resolution inverse problem, the heterogeneity field is parameterized in the spectral domain using the Grid Connectivity-based Transform (GCT) to provide a compressed representation that captures only the sensitive geologic trends. The CGT concurrently imposes geological continuity during calibration and promotes minimal changes to each prior ensemble member. The proposed calibration workflow is applied to a structurally complex, fractured reservoir located offshore Peru. The reservoir is modeled as dual porosity and single permeability (DPSP). In the global calibration step, the field water production rates, gas rates and average reservoir pressure are matched using the GA together with zonal multipliers that represent spatial variation in aquifer strength, fracture porosity and a matrix-fracture coupling parameter. In the subsequent local step, the well-by-well production histories are matched through calibration of the most uncertain grid-cell parameter, fracture permeability, which is characterized using the GCT parameterization. The final calibrated models are consistent with geologic interpretation and are currently being applied for field development strategies.|","Hierarchical Model Calibration Approach, Multiscale Spectral-Domain Parameterization, Domain Decomposition, Fractured Reservoir, Spectral Clustering"

After discovery in 1984 this oil field was developed on primary production with hydraulically fractured vertical wells. Following an initial steep decline in production the wells exhibit late time modest declines at marginally economic rates. In 2005, Hornbuckle field was generally believed to be depleted on primary production and IOR was not considered to be an option because of failed waterfloods in neighboring fields. Production analysis indicated the presence of long term linear flow from Hornbuckle wells lasting more than 15 years. This flow regime indicates the presence of geologically-controlled high aspect ratio flow units related to permeability anisotropy/connectivity issues. This is an inefficient drainage process which can result in low recovery factors and further opportunities for infill drilling. Geological and engineering studies were performed to investigate the feasibility of horizontal well drilling in this field. The paper will show the data mining aspects which identified the opportunity as well as the more detailed analysis that ultimately lead to horizontal well drilling and multi-stage fracturing beginning in 2006. Finally, available horizontal well production performance will be reviewed. Since 2006, field oil production rate has increased more than 25-fold and cumulative oil production has doubled.

However, owing to the higher viscosity, injectivity of polymer solutions is of some concern and is important to understand and predict. Achieving high injection rates is required to increase oil production rates fast. In the field test performed in the Matzen field, polyacrylamide polymers have been injected for the past two years. Core flood experiments with these polymers showed a significant increase in apparent viscosity with flow rate which is attributed to the viscoelastic properties of the polymer solutions. Also, severe degradation for high flow velocities was detected. In addition to core flood experiments, flow experiments through fractures were performed. For these experiments, shear-thinning and limited degradation were seen. Detailed simulations including the complex polymer rheology in the fractures and matrix, temperature effects and rock mechanics were conducted. The results of the simulations using the laboratory and field derived data matched the field test data. The simulations revealed that two distinct phases can be observed in polyacrylamide polymer solution projects (1) injection under matrix conditions in an early phase resulting in severe degradation of the polymers and (2) injection under fracturing conditions once the formation parting pressure is reached, leading to limited degradation of the polymers. The calibrated model was used to investigate dynamic fracture growth dependent on polymer rheology and particle plugging. The implications of fracture growth on injectivity and reservoir sweep are discussed. The results of the field test and investigations indicate that screening of fields for polyacrylamide polymer projects should include geomechanical properties of the reservoir sand and cap/base rock in addition to the conventional parameters such as oil viscosity, water salinity, reservoir temperature and reservoir permeability.

In order to understand the performance of waterflooding in nano-darcy permeability, naturally fractured shale reservoirs, an integrated study of spontaneous imbibition has been performed. In this study, oil recovery during spontaneous imbibition in naturally fractured shale samples was improved using different water formulations. Different water solutions were formulated by adding different amounts of HCl and NaOH to either distilled water or 30 wt% KCl-base brine solution. Eight water formulations, distilled water, 30 wt% KCl brine, low pH HCl solutions (0.39, 0.4, and 0.57), and high pH alkaline solutions (11.8, 11.9, and 13) were examined to recover oil from shale rock samples. Outcrop core samples from Mancos shale were used in this study. The samples were 2.54 to 3.81 cm in diameter and 0.762 to 5.08 cm in length. Firstly, we studied the porosity of the used samples using CT Scanning. The average porosity was 2.7% for the used samples. Secondly, we studied the rock stability and spontaneous imbibtion of  different Mancos samples in distilled water, 30 wt% KCl, low pH solutions and high pH alkaline solutions. Mancos samples were very sensitive to distilled water which resulted in whole samples damage due to sever clay swelling. During the spontaneous imbibition, the maximum oil recovery was 59% using distilled water due to whole sample damage. The low and high pH solutions also improved oil recovery from Mancos samples up to 53% due to mineral dissolution and with more stability conditions compared with distilled water. In addition to mineral dissolution, rock wettability was also altered to more water-wet conditions using low and high pH solutions that has been confirmed by the measured contact angles on the used Mancos samples, where the measured contact angles were less compared to rock initial values. The high and low pH solution affected the rock hardness differently. The low pH solutions lowered Mancos rock hardness up to 34%, while the high pH solutions strengthened the rock up to 143% more. |","water imbibition in shale formations, waterflooding in Mancos shale  formation, alkaline imbibition in shale formations, impact of low solutions on Macos hardness, impact of high solutions on Macos hardness"

In this paper, a fully coupled multi-component multi-continuum compositional simulator which incorporates several transport/storage mechanisms is developed. To accurately capture physics behind the transport process in shale nanopores, Kundsen diffusion and gas slippage are included in the flow model. An extended Langmuir isotherm is used to describe the adsorption/desorption behavior of different gas components and the displacement process of methane as free gas. Pressure-dependent permeability (due to rock deformation) of natural fractures induced by hydraulic fracturing is also considered in the simulator. In addition, modeling of complex fracture networks is very crucial for simulating production of shale gas reservoirs because there exists various scales of fractures with multiple orientations after the fracturing treatment for horizontal well. In this work, a hierarchical approach which integrates EDFM with dual-continuum concept is adopted. The hybrid model includes three domains: matrix, major hydraulic fractures and large-scale natural fractures (described by EDFM), and micro-fractures in SRV region which are modeled by dual-continuum approach. Embedded Discrete Fractures Model (EDFM) is an efficient approach for explicitly simulating large-scale fractures in Cartesian grid instead of complicated unstructured grid. Moreover, a nested-grid refinement method is used to capture the fluids transfer from matrix to fractures. Fully implicit scheme is applied for discretizing fluid equations, and the corresponding Jacobian matrix is evaluated by Automatic Differentiation with Expression Templates Library (ADETL). The AD-Library framework allows wide flexibility in the choice of variable sets and provides generic representations of discretized expressions for gridblocks. Several simulations and sensitivity analysis are performed with the developed research code for determining the key factors affecting shale gas recovery. Modeling studies indicate that the properties of fracture networks could greatly influence methane production. Different injection strategies including huff-n-puff process are also evaluated for optimizing production of multi-fractured horizontal well. Results show that CO2/N2 injection can be an effective approach with great application potential for enhancing shale gas recovery.|","CO2 injection, Multi-Continuum, Enhanced gas recovery, Shale gas reservoirs, Fracture networks"

To date, there are few theoretical studies on estimating how much bypassed oil within an oil reservoir could be mobilized by such vibrational stimulation. To fill this gap, this paper presents a numerical method to estimate the extent to which the bypassed oil is mobilized from low to high permeability reservoir areas, within a heterogeneous reservoir, via wave-induced cross-flow oscillation at the interface between the two reservoir permeability areas. This work uses the finite element method to numerically obtain the pore fluid wave motion within a one-dimensional fluid-saturated porous permeable elastic solid medium embedded in a non-permeable elastic semi-infinite solid. To estimate the net volume of mobilized oil from the low to the high permeability area, a fluid flow hysteresis hypothesis is adopted to describe the behavior at the interface between the two areas. Accordingly, the fluid that is moving from the low to the high permeability areas is assumed to transport a larger volume of oil than the fluid moving in the opposite direction. The numerical experiments were conducted by using a prototype heterogeneous oil reservoir model, subjected to ground surface dynamic loading operating at low frequencies (1 to 50 Hz). The numerical results show that a sizeable amount of oil could be mobilized via the elastic wave stimulation. It is observed that certain wave frequencies are more effective than others in mobilizing the remaining oil. We remark that these amplification frequencies depend on the formations elastic properties. This numerical work shows that the wave-based mobilization of the bypassed oil in a heterogeneous oil reservoir is feasible, especially when combined with another EOR method, such as wettability alteration by low-concentration surfactant injection. The extension of this research into a more realistic three-dimensional reservoir model would help determine the optimal locations and frequencies of wave sources that could maximize the volume of mobilized oil.|","Elastic wave-based enhanced oil recovery, Fluid flow hysteresis, Wave energy focusing, Estimation of vibrational oil mobilization rate, Biot wave equations for poroelastic media"

There was also the risk of encountering shallow gas and high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide gas across different formations in the field. Hence, the biggest challenge for the field development plan was to develop a well construction design that would provide well integrity and at the same time allow running casings and completions to the desired depth. In addition, different hole sections were experiencing well control, loss circulation, and wellbore stability issues all at once, resulting in a loss of well integrity or total lost circulation. This was making torque and drag unmanageable, which meant inability to drill, run conventional or drillpipe conveyed wireline logs, or run casing and completion. Also, there was a high incidence of stuck pipe events due to wellbore stability issues and hole cleaning problems in a lost circulation scenario. Due to the torque and drag limitation, performing a sidetrack was not an option in the field.

The mechanics of delivering the treatment involves pumping pulses of alternating clean and dirty pulses of fluid with fibers that keeps the proppant in suspension.

Natural gas hydrates are found in the earth under high pressure and low temperature where water and gas co-exist, typically in permafrost and sub-marine environments. Hydrates have been considered a nuisance in the petroleum industry, creating barriers in pipe lines, and effort has mainly been put into preventing hydrate formation. However, natural gas hydrates are in recent decades acknowledged as a potential energy resource for the future; even conservative estimates suggest 10^15 m3 CH4 STP present within hydrate.

Shale gas production has been gaining worldwide attention over the past several years. This is due to the economic gas reserves using two current advanced technologies that are horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing. Shale has a high total organic content (TOC) that may adsorb significant amount of natural gas. In addition, laboratory and theoretical calculations indicate that organic-rich shales adsorb CO2 preferentially over CH4. Hence, the extent of organic matter in shale plays an important role in determining the feasibility of CO2 injection with potential benefit of enhanced gas recovery (EGR). 
The performance of CO2 injection and CH4 recovery in shale reservoirs is a complex function of several engineering parameters including fracture half-length, fracture conductivity, and fracture height, operating parameters such as injection volume and injection time, and geologic parameters including reservoir permeability, porosity, and thickness. Nevertheless, the effects of the above uncertain parameters on the process of CO2-EGR are not clearly understood and systematically studied. Therefore, it is absolutely critical to quantify uncertainties and investigate the most important influential parameters controlling this process. 
In this paper, we employ numerical reservoir simulation techniques to model multiple hydraulic fractures and multi-component Langmuir isotherms. Two scenarios for CO2 injection are investigated when the primary gas production decreases to the economic limit: (1) CO2 flooding in two horizontal wells, and (2) CO2 huff-n-puff in a horizontal well. A series of reservoir simulations based on Design of Experiment (DOE) are performed on the best scenario to investigate the critical parameters that control this CO2-EGR process in the Barnett Shale. This work enables operators to plan ahead of time and optimize a tertiary shale gas production process by considering the different investigated influential parameters.|","enhanced gas recovery, CO2 flooding, CO2 Huff-n-puff, Sensitivity study, Barnett Shale"

This basin has a complex geomechanical stress regime in which the minimum horizontal stress is changing in some parts and also having stress dependent permeability due to shear dilation. These characteristics have a major impact on the gas recovery from different fields in this basin. In order to prove stress dependent permeability and develop a model, first a three dimensional hydraulic fracturing model is constructed based on wire-line logs and minifrac tests then the resulting fracture geometry and conductivity are used as an input data for dynamic reservoir flow simulation. We found that the reservoir permeability is changing at different time periods during pressure and production history matching. In this paper the stress-permeability relationship was developed by assuming a fully elastic fractured network of flow path to the wellbore in a hydraulically fractured well and then this model was tested by a partially coupled geomechanical simulation in Big Lake field. The results show that the proposed approach considering the stress dependency of the permeability has better predictions than when the permeability is assumed to be constant. By this procedure not only the predictions are improved but also the computational time is reduced. Stress dependent permeability model is a short cut for using fully coupled geomechanical reservoir simulators. Actually, the current fully coupled finite element geomechanical reservoir simulations need a lot of data and high computational time. This paper presents an alternative approach of partial coupling of geomechanics and reservoir simulation, whereas in the proposed procedure only a finite difference simulator is used which needs much less computational time and is relatively cheaper.|","partial geomechanics and reservoir coupling, tight gas reservoir, stress dependent permeability"

Sulphur contents, wax contents also affect viscosity, recovery and price per barrel. In shale plays the liquid-gas cut-off must be known precisely, and production from the liquid-prone zone optimised. In-place does not necessarily correspond to produced GOR. In particular the transition from volatile oil, to condensate to wet gas is crucial, and production strategies must be developed accordingly. The first step in unravelling the fractionation phenomena occurring in both play types is to determine the bulk composition of the petroleum that is first-formed in the source rock. This is because all subsequent processes simply act upon and modify this original composition. Here we present numerous case studies where PhaseKinetics (di Primio and Horsfield, 2006), a compositional kinetic approach for predicting in-situ bulk fluid properties, has been employed in appraising acreage, and then go on to consider the critical aspects surrounding unconventional plays. In high pressure-high temperature (HPHT) reservoirs of the North Sea, which can be considered closed systems, black to light oil GOR distributions in the North Sea Viking Graben closely matched the predictions from our MSSV pyrolysis experiments (method of Horsfield et al., 1989) performed on the Draupne Formation source rock (di Primio and Skeie, 2004). In a similar study of the Jade and Judy Fields in the Central Graben (di Primio and Neumann, 2008), GOR predictions from MSSV pyrolysis bore a close resemblance to the natural HPHT system. Other examples of excellent GOR predictive capability are provided by modelling the Egret Shale and its generated petroleum in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin, Canada (Baur et al., 2010), and the Bakken Shale and its petroleums in the Williston Basin, USA (Kuhn et al., 2010, 2012). Gas composition dominantly controls the phase behaviour of petroleum (di Primio et al., 1998). The PhaseKinetics compositional kinetic model utilises corrected gas compositions from MSSV pyrolysates, as well as pseudo-boiling ranges in the C6+ range to populate bulk activation energy potentials (di Primio and Horsfield, 2006). Examples from the Norwegian North Sea, Brazil and Mexico presented in that publication have demonstrated the close correspondence of the tuned compositional predictions with field data.

This study uses a dataset from the Williston basin to evaluate the impact of this condition in modern horizontal completions. The methodology consists of using pore pressure maps to build a 3D geomechanical model. Later, this information is incorporated in a numerical fracture simulator to understand fracture geometry and quantify wing asymmetry.

A North America case study is presented. Operators, entering new prospect areas with little well control, must make decisions on locating their exploratory wells with limited capital for areas covering many sections. Large prospect areas can be covered by a variety of different mineral rights and surface permitting obligations. Due to the large amount of uncertainties in geologic subsurface characteristics, complexity of topography, available infrastructure, operational issues, and environmental and regulatory challenges associated with appraisal activities, the decision to appraise an acreage position is very complex and has a high level of risk. The solution presented is a procedure that considers the most critical variables needed for appraisal. The variables are used to generate optimized drilling scenarios under various uncertainties and constraints using a mathematical optimization procedure and a score card of surface cultural characteristics. An objective function is used to maximize the acreages appraisal value as expressed as recoverable hydrocarbon volume and associated probability distributions using Efficient Frontier Portfolio analysis. The objective function considers the following parameters, which were coded in the scorecard: estimated expected hydrocarbon content ranges in each section, surface impacts (surface topography, infrastructure, permitting, and roads), execution (well production), operational impacts, and opportunity factor. Drilling scenarios were generated from acreage coverage templates which created specific appraisal location patterns. The value of the objective function was generated from those locations to optimize the generation of drilling scenarios and was adjusted by a probabilistic critical risk factor. The final effort entailed a special portfolio management analysis to recognize priorities in the drilling portfolio by identifying and ranking strategic locations.

The available 3D seismic shows the reservoir to be thin (below seismic resolution). The reservoir depends on hydraulic fracturing to free hydrocarbons from the tight formation by creating a complex fracture network which cannot be measured by reflection seismic since the 3D seismic survey is shot before the drilling campaign. As a result, the relationship between seismic attributes and unconventional production is poorly documented and even more poorly understood. During analysis of one particular 3D seismic survey in the North Dakota Bakken play area, we recognized 16 seismic attributes that showed statistically robust correlations with cumulative productions from 19 Middle Bakken H1 wells (H1 indicating the initial horizontal production well in a particular DSU - Drilling Spacing Unit) in the study area. This was accomplished via a workflow that exhaustively searched a set of 99 interpretation-based seismic attributes derived from the interpretation mapping software. These attributes, along with 2 engineering production parameters readily available (total length of completion intervals and number of stages) were passed into a multi-linear regression model where backward elimination was employed to eliminate the statistically redundant attributes. The final linear statistical models based on the extracted seismic attributes from wellbore completion intervals show that Relative Acoustic Impedance is the only statistically significant attribute remaining (from the original 16 robust attributes) to predict the cumulative production in the study area.  |","3D seismic survey interpretation Middle Bakken, completion intervals and number of stages, multi-linear regression, backward elimination, interpretation mapping software"

In the second step we match gas rate versus time using Production Data Analysis, which gives a much lower production permeability and a reduced size for SRV (stimulated reservoir volume). Data from five wells in Fayetteville shale have been analyzed using new software. The two diagnostics (injection and production perm) have been correlated to various fracture treatment parameters, to improve fracture stimulations. Application/Development: Injection permeability and porosity can provide average fracture spacing and aperture width during fracture stimulation. To retain more of the injection permeability, and the size of the SRV, we tailor the proppant to the width and spacing of the induced fracture network, which determine spreading of the proppant along with diameter and density of proppant. All these factors have been included in a conceptual model for proppant spreading away from a horizontal well. Results, Observations, and Conclusions:  Potential horizontal fracture components in three wells may act to reduce breadth and height of the MS cloud (ie, less outward and height spread of fracture fluid).  Proppant volume is a very small fraction (<4%) of fracture network volume.  Created fractures are further apart in deeper wells. This reflects the degree of compaction of the formation. This depth trend is consistent with fracture spacing from MS events in other fields.  Average fracture width in the network increases with depth which suggests to try an increasing proportion of 40-70 sand with depth. In two of the studied wells, may even be able to use 30-50 sand.  A regression equation enables a prediction of SRV productivity. When effective stress increases, SRV productivity decreases. This is expected: it is harder to sustain a fracture network in a formation with larger effective stress (ie. deeper wells).  When amount of proppant (40-70 or 100-mesh) increases, SRV productivity increases. This is expected if proppant is needed to stop fractures in the network from closing during drawdown. But an increase in 100-mesh proppant will be more beneficial as compared with 40-70 proppant. Significance of Subject Matter: The MS matching provides new information on spacing and aperture width of fractures in a network. Using a model for proppant spreading built around this information should help operators optimize proppant transport in shale gas and oil wells, to retain a larger SRV, and greater permeability enhancement within the SRV.|","Model microseismic spread, Fracture aperture width, Model proppant spreading, Fayetteville shale, Fracture network"

High resolution numerical simulation with local PEBI grids and global corner point grids has also been used to represent complex non-planar fracture geometry, conductivity and to estimate subsequent well performance. While the analytic tools are fraught with simplified assumptions, numerical simulation techniques are computationally expensive and do not provide the more geometric understanding derived from the depth of investigation and the drainage volume calculations. We propose a novel approach for rapid field-scale performance assessment of Shale Gas and Shale Oil reservoirs. Our proposed approach is based on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation in heterogeneous reservoirs and serves a bridge between simplified analytical tools and complex numerical simulation. The high frequency solution leads to the Eikonal equation that governs the propagation of a pressure front in the reservoir. The Eikonal equation generalizes the depth of investigation to heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs and provides an efficient way to calculate drainage volume, pressure depletion and well performance. Most importantly, the Eikonal equation can be solved using the Fast Marching Method which can be orders of magnitude faster than conventional numerical simulators. The speed and versatility of our proposed method makes it ideally suited for high resolution reservoir characterization through integration of static and dynamic data. The major advantages of the proposed approach are its simplicity, intuitive appeal and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the power and utility of our method using a field example that involves history matching, uncertainty analysis and performance assessment of a shale gas reservoir located in East Texas. A sensitivity study is first carried out to systematically identify the heavy hitters impacting the well performance. This is followed by a history matching and uncertainty analysis to identify the fracture parameters and the stimulated reservoir volume. A comparison of model predictions with the actual well performance shows that our approach is able to reliably predict the pressure depletion and rate decline.|","Data integration, Shale Gas and oil, History Matching, Fast Marching Method"

This paper presents a pragmatic integrated workflow, used to optimize development and guide critical development decisions in the Black Hawk field, Eagle Ford Shale. Geoscientists, reservoir and, completion engineers worked collaboratively to identify the optimal completion designs and well spacings for development focus areas. Multiple simplistic simulation models were history matched to existing production wells. Wide uncertainty exists in many key reservoir and completion parameters. Using stochastic realizations from ranges of key properties, uncertainty was reduced using the history matching process. The resulting calibrated reservoir scenarios formed the basis of optimization studies for development drilling and down spacing. Completion design parameters, including fracture stage length, perforation clusters per stage and landing point for the lateral, were evaluated in hydraulic fracture models. The resulting fracture geometries were simulated and the optimum completion design and well spacing determined for each area. The optimal development was shown to vary by region, due to changing reservoir, fluid and geomechanical properties. The use of multiple subsurface realizations, spanning an appropriate range of uncertainty, was critical to the success of this study.

Development is typically with vertical wells, which are stimulated with multiple hydraulic fractures targeting the best expected pay intervals for commingled production. A significant challenge for operators is determining the optimum well locations and spacing for efficient reserve development. Operators use various field data and analytics to determine well spacing, although limited data, for example only early in-life production data, and lack of zonal production or pressure data pose difficulties to making good decisions. In this situation, numerical models can yield insights about drainage patterns. This paper reports a case study using a geologic model and a reservoir simulation model to evaluate reducing well spacing to increase gross recovered oil. A three-dimensional geologic model was constructed for a 14-section area in the Midland Basin using detailed log evaluations for net pay intervals, core calibrations and production test data. An extensive core-log statistical study yielded calibrated rock types at the wells. Reservoir and geomechanical properties were then spatially distributed using geostatistical techniques subject to three-dimensional seismic constraints, to yield pore volume, saturation, and brittleness. A reservoir simulation model was then generated from the geologic model for a 223-acre (3600 feet x 2700 feet) sector of interest. The sector model was history-matched to early production data and historical type curves. Each well had 10-12 fracture stages, which were explicitly modeled using parameters derived from post-execution analysis of fracture job data. Pressure data were obtained from submersible pump sensors, where available, or estimated from wellbore fluid level surveys. Once history-matched, the simulation model was run on prediction mode for 40-acre and 20-acre well spacing. Incremental production and economic comparisons resulting from in-fill well spacing is presented. The study provides a technical workflow for analyzing potential to decrease well spacing.

Aligned with this criteria, stimulation fluids and/or completion strategy have been engineered to maximize the induced fracture complexity in unconventional reservoirs. In typical horizontal completions large induced fracture complexity with sustained conductivity is clearly beneficial for the productivity of nano-darcy shales, but this may not be a requirement for all unconventional reservoirs which also include tight sands. In some unconventional reservoirs operators have observed similar well productivity in wells with predominantly planar fractures versus wells which appeared to have more complex fractures. The proposed paper supported by extensive reservoir simulations aims to develop criteria for when induced fracture complexity and sustained conductivity is really needed and when it is not needed. The simulations include a reservoir permeability range of 10 nano-darcy to 0.01 md and complexity or secondary fracture conductivity of 1 to 5 mD-ft. The results show that the fracture complexity and sustained conductivity is generally important for reservoir permeabilities lower than 100 nano-darcy for the case of gas producing reservoirs. For liquid producing reservoirs the upper permeability limit will be higher, which will be addressed in the paper.

Many naturally fractured reservoirs around the world have depletedsignificantly, and improved-oil-recovery (IOR) processes are necessary forfurther development. Hence, the modeling of fractured reservoirs has receivedincreased attention recently. Accurate modeling and simulation of naturallyfractured reservoirs (NFRs) is still challenging because of permeabilityanisotropies and contrasts. Nonphysical abstractions inherent in conventionaldual-porosity and dual-permeability models make them inadequate for solvingdifferent fluid-flow problems in fractured reservoirs. Also, recenttechnologies for discrete fracture modeling may suffer from large simulationrun times, and the industry has not used such approaches widely, even thoughthey give more-accurate representations of fractured reservoirs thandual-continuum models. We developed an embedded discrete fracture model (DFM)for an in-house compositional reservoir simulator that borrows the dual-mediumconcept from conventional dual-continuum models and also incorporates theeffect of each fracture explicitly. The model is compatible with existingfinite-difference reservoir simulators. In contrast to dual-continuum models,fractures have arbitrary orientations and can be oblique or vertical, honoringthe complexity of a typical NFR. The accuracy of the embedded DFM is confirmedby comparing the results with the fine-grid, explicit-fracture simulations fora case study including orthogonal fractures and a case with a nonalignedfracture. We also perform a grid-sensitivity study to show the convergence ofthe method as the grid is refined. Our simulations indicate that to achieveaccurate results, the embedded discrete fracture model may only requiremoderate mesh refinement around the fractures and hence offers acomputationally efficient approach. Furthermore, examples of waterflooding, gasinjection, and primary depletion are presented to demonstrate the performanceand applicability of the developed method for simulating fluid flow inNFRs.|","Document Type

However, current standards (API RP19D/ISO13503-2) specify that the test be conducted with the best achievable loose pack, a target that is infamous for its poor repeatability. Our study suggests that this method may also be significantly underestimating the actual strength exhibited by the material under downhole conditions. One of the key elements in frac job design is matching the crush strength of the proppant to the closure stress of the reservoir. The industry has gotten quite good at measuring closure stress. But the methods for determining the crush resistance of proppant have changed little over the past 20 years. In this study, we looked at methods of simulating close-packing, as might be expected in-situ, due to downhole cyclical changes in the loading. It is assumed that this cyclical relaxation-restressing of the proppant pack leads to a minimum packing volume. The data collected in this study indicates that a statistically significant improvement in crush resistance results when the proppant is intentionally allowed to achieve a minimum packing volume. Methods of determining the actual in-situ crush resistance of the proppant are proposed, based on the signature produced by the particle size and shape of proppant produced back to surface during the life of the well. This data can then be compared to several laboratory methods to produce results that are more predictive of fracture performance and expected folds-of-improvement. This study suggests that the current method of producing numerical crush resistance ratings does not match well with the actual performance. If this or similar new methods of conditioning the packing of the proppant during the crush resistance test can be shown to better represent the actual resistance-to-crush that can be expected in the fracture, a significant reduction in completions costs in unconventional reservoirs might be achieved.|","strength, proppant, crush resistance, laboratory, crush"

Specifically, in very low permeability unconventional reservoirs the requirement for smaller perforation and fracture spacing may not be possible due to the geomechanical interference between fractures. In this case, the commonly used zipper frac technique may provide an avenue to create multiple fractures at closer spacing. The benefits of zipper fracs can be maximized by generating proper fracture geometry and also by properly staggering the perforation and fracture system. This paper reviews and discusses the numerical reservoir modeling results of a zipper frac that show the individual or combined effects of the perforation/fracture staggering; fracture length, fracture overlap, fracture conductivity and/or proppant distribution effects in comparison with a conventional completion that does not use the staggered zipper frac approach. The simulation results are compared over a wide range of unconventional reservoirs permeabilities for both gas and light oil.

Conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models (e.g., Archie, dual-water, and Waxman-Smits) assume that the pore water is the only conductive part of the formation. However, this assumption is not reliable in the presence of the thermally mature organic matter, clay, and pyrite found in many source rocks. Previous experimental studies indicate that as the aromaticity of kerogen increases with increasing thermal maturity, the conductive behavior of kerogen is also affected. In this paper, we investigated the effect of conductive kerogen on the resistivity of mature source rocks. |We investigated the reliability of conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models for estimating fluid saturation in organic-rich mudrocks, using well logs and core measurements from the Haynesville Shale. We then numerically simulated the electric field, electric currents, and effective resistivity of synthetic pore-scale rock images. Finally, we used numerical simulation to quantify the effects of the (a) volumetric concentration of kerogen, (b) kerogen conductivity, and (c) spatial connectivity of the kerogen-water network on the resistivity of organic-rich mudrocks. |Well-log interpretation of the Haynesville Shale showed that conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models underestimate hydrocarbon saturation in zones with high concentrations of kerogen.

From the point of view of safety, real-time formation evaluation helps mitigate drilling-associated risks and optimize drilling parameters. The practices of pore-pressure prediction and wellbore stability estimates are based on real-time logs, including acoustic and gamma measurements and formation-pressure tests, as well as surface-data logs. By continually monitoring and interpreting the measurements, formation-evaluation specialists help the drillers stay within safe limits, while optimizing the rate of penetration. In more recent applications, real-time borehole-geometry logs help recognize potentially unstable zones. From the point of view of well positioning, real-time information helps the geophysicist and the geologist recognize the strata and locate the well more accurately on the structure. Some of the same sensors used for drilling safety and for drilling optimization are also instrumental in locating the well on the geological section. |Because the economics for deepwater require significantly more rigor and better risk assessment and reduction than for land or for near-shore prospects, formation evaluation is generally comprehensive and thorough. Operators will deploy the most advanced technology in order to obtain a more complete view of the reservoir. In addition to the traditional triple-combo logging sensors, advanced 3D resistivity sensors and magnetic-resonance logs are routinely utilized in deepwater. There are striking examples of fluid typing with the latter, while the former helps evaluate turbidite reservoirs, and in some cases determine the structural dip. Fluid-sampling analyzers continue to improve in sensitivity and accuracy. A new integrated optical spectrometer provides direct compositional fluid analysis based on analog optical computation methods. |Formation evaluation in deepwater is performed with either wireline or LWD or a combination of both. Wireline has been traditionally considered as more accurate and with a more complete offering. The quality gap however is narrowing with the introduction of the latest technology in LWD. Formation fluid sampling and high-resolution borehole imaging are now possible in LWD, although with less flexibility, at this writing. Logs acquired while drilling encounter significantly less invasion and fewer borehole irregularities than with wireline. They are often as accurate as their wireline counterparts, but remain limited in accommodating the large range of borehole sizes seen in deepwater. LWD logs are sent via telemetry to the surface as insurance logging, should the well be lost.

One process that has been proposed as an explanation for network complexity is the termination of a propagating fracture when it reaches a preexisting fracture. Fracture termination has been described in laboratory experiments and mine-back studies and could lead to branching of the fracture network, generating complexity. However, network branching process could lead to reduced fluid recovery. Continuous pathways for flow must pass through fractures of a variety of orientations, with different closure pressures. We studied this process using CFRAC, a hydraulic fracturing simulator that couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation in large, complex discrete fracture network models. Simulations were performed with two different networks: (1) a complex, branching network of both new and preexisting fractures and (2) several linear, continuous fractures. The simulations show how fluid recovery can be drastically reduced by the closure of bottleneck fractures in the complex fracture network case. These results also demonstrate that identification of fracture ""closure"" from pressure transients at the wellbore does not necessarily indicate that open fractures are not remaining in the formation.

Gas hydrates in reservoirs are generally not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and there may be several competing phase transitions involving hydrate. Formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrates during aquifer storage of CO2 involves roughly 10 vol% increase compared with groundwater. Dissociation of hydrate toward undersaturated fluid phases involves the same level of contraction. Hydrate phase transitions are generally fast (scales of seconds) compared with mineral dissolution and precipitation, and it is unlikely that a time-shifted explicit coupling to geomechanical analysis will be able to capture the appropriate dynamic couplings between flow and changes in stress. The need for geomechanical integrity of the storage site therefore requires a reservoir simulator with an implicit solution of mass flow, heat flow, and geomechanics. And because CO2 involved in hydrate is also involved in different geochemical reactions, we propose a scheme where all possible hydrate formation (on water/CO2 interface, from water solution, and from CO2 adsorbed on mineral surfaces) and all different possible dissociations are treated as pseudoreactions, but with kinetics derived from advanced theoretical modeling. The main tools for generating these models have been phase-field-theory (PFT) simulations, with thermodynamic properties derived from molecular modeling. The detailed results from these types of simulations provides information on the relative impact of mass transport, heat transport, and thermodynamics of the phase transition, which enable qualified simplifications for implementation into RetrasoCodeBright (RCB) (Saaltink et al. 2004).

This study presents a numerical investigation of pressure and flow transient analysis of gas production from a horizontal, multi-staged well in shale gas reservoirs. A specialized three-dimensional, two-phase simulator is developed and used for this purpose, which incorporates known nonlinear flow behavior in shale gas reservoirs. First we discuss a multi-domain, multi-continuum concept for handling multi-scaled heterogeneity and fractures, i.e., using hybrid modeling approaches to describe different types and scales of fractures from explicit modeling of hydraulic fractures and fracture network in simulated reservoir volume (SRV) to distributed natural fractures, microfractures, and tight matrix. Then sensitivity studies of transient pressure responses and flow rates are presented with respect to hydraulic fractures geometry, stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), and natural fracture density. We will also compare the behaviors with two different interporosity flow assumptions, fully-transient and quasi-steady state flow. Unlike conventional reservoirs, their difference cannot be ignored due to the extremely low shale matrix permeability and significant gas compressibility. Specifically, we will analyze a field example from Barnett shale to demonstrate the use of results and methodology of this study.|","shale gas production, shale gas reservoir simulation, multi-staged fractured  horizontal well, pressure transient analysis, frcatured reservoirs"

It is critical to recognize brittle units amenable to hydraulic fracturing and rich in organic matter. Shale mineralogy affects not only the effectiveness of stimulation, but also the ratio of free to absorbed gas. Heterogeneity in shale reservoirs expressed by mineral composition, organic matter richness and brittleness significantly influences shale-gas production. Although providing the necessary information, core data and pulsed neutron spectroscopy (PNS) logs are limited by cost considerations to an insufficient number of wells in order to sufficiently characterize reservoir heterogeneity. We present an approach of petrophysical analysis and statistic reverse modeling to better determine mineral concentration, organic matter percentage, and volume of gas and water using conventional logs in the Marcellus Shale (Appalachian basin, USA). Core data and PNS logs are utilized to guide and demonstrate the results. The statistically based reverse model incorporates random errors of logging, and solves mineral composition through matching the original logs with mineralogy models. The effectiveness of statistical reverse models is enhanced through removing the effects of minerals with significant petrophysical response (e.g., barite) and fluids. Barite strongly affects the mineralogical estimates in shale. The concentration of such minerals can be predicted by the difference between PE curve and a trend line. Fluid volumes are predicted by a modified shaly-sand model with uranium concentration through understanding the effect of organic matter. The methodology proposed provides an approach to predict mineral composition and organic richness and the corresponding mineralogical properties (e.g., geomechanical and free-to-absorbed gas ratio). The proposed approach aids in recognizing geologic and engineering targets, designing horizontal well trajectories, targeting fracturing strategies and understanding shale depositional environments and processes. The proposed approach can be extended to other organic-rich shale reservoirs.|","Statistical Reverse Model, TOC Content, Marcellus Shale, Mineral Composition"

The geomechanical properties of an unconventional reservoir or shale, especially the minimum in-situ stress and fracture gradients, are important for several applications such as mud weight optimization and completion design. Two common methods of direct stress testing are using a wireline formation tester (WFT) with straddle packers and surface-pressure-based fracture injection tests (FITs). 
Microfracturing was performed at several depths using a WFT in tight clastic and shale oil formations in a well in west Texas. In the same well, microfracturing was also performed using the FIT method, and hence, the two results could be compared. Imaging logs show many drilling-induced fractures in the target intervals, but formation testing with straddle packers did not provide any successful pressure measurements or formation fluid samples because of the low permeability and lack of a natural fracture network in the near-wellbore region. However, fractures were successfully induced in multiple zones by using the WFT microfracturing tool, and the results compare favorably with the geomechanical logs. Downhole quartz pressure gauges used with the microfracturing are very sensitive and can be used to calibrate surface-pressure-based FITs. Microfractures can be induced with less than a few gallons of drilling mud, and the pressure response is observed downhole without any frictional losses or time lag. In addition, the closure time derived from microfracturing is much shorter than the surface FIT-based closure time; however, microfracturing entails additional rig time. 
In-situ stresses control the orientation and propagation direction of hydraulic fractures. Microfractures are tensile fractures that open in the direction of least resistance. These fractures are also affected by hoop stress in the near-wellbore region, drilling induced fractures, and borehole breakouts. Results indicate that stress gradients, which vary widely across the basin and lithofacies, are controlled by local and regional stresses. The stress gradients derived from microfractures are compared to sonic-log derived gradients and indicate that a symbiotic relation exists in calibrating and quality controlling sonic logs, image logs, and microfracture testing. 
Intervals with drilling-induced fractures that extend beyond 3 feet tend to give lower stress gradients from microfracture testing and these zones should be avoided for microfracturing. Existing natural open fractures reduce the ability of the WFT tool to seal against the borehole and to create and propagate a fracture in the formation. The location of unaltered formation should be promptly identified for testing prior to entry into the borehole. This may entail having wellsite interpreters as data transmission speeds can pose a constraint while uploading and interpreting image logs offsite. Sonic-log-derived models for stress gradients can be calibrated with pore pressure and overbalance from WFT. Stress gradients generated from microfracture testing can be used to calibrate parameters such as Biots constant in the sonic stress gradient models derived from poroelastic theory. Ideally, several lithofacies should be targeted for microfracturing to provide a representative stress profile. Imaging logs run after microfracturing can give an indication of the extent and direction of microfractures.|","shale, delaware basin, rock mechanics, fracture injection test, microfracturing"

After establishing the structural architecture of the drilled lateral section to determine which part of the lateral is in or out of zone, lithology and petrophysical properties from the offset wells were propagated using geostatistical algorithms to match the horizontal well path enabling understanding of reservoir variability along the lateral. A relatively far offset well with advanced log suite was also utilized to generate synthetic mechanical rock properties along the lateral. The lithology properties from the OH triple combo logs and the mechanical rock properties along the lateral showed good correlation. This data was used for optimized completion design by placing frac stages in like rock and intelligently placing perforation clusters guided by rock type and geomechanical properties as opposed to geometrical spacing along lateral for a more effective and productive stimulation treatment. The assumption that rock properties are homogenous and structural dip are fairly constant in horizontal drilling has been proven to be untrue in recent studies and production logs have shown that not all stages/perforation clusters contribute to production. In some cases as in this case, most horizontal wells are landed and placed with gamma ray (GR) measurements without inclusion of azimuthal (round the hole) measurements such as images and distance to boundary measurements. Correlation of drilled laterals with offset well data with GR only measurements usually provide non-unique solutions especially in targets with lateral and vertical rock property heterogeneity. The consequence of not using image log measurements in geosteering the lateral to ensure that the lateral is in the target reservoir can lead to ineffective stimulation treatment and possibly skipping stages in parts of the lateral that is landed in a higher stressed rock. Post stimulation analysis was also included in this study to evaluate the hydraulic fractures to correlate back into the mechanical properties model. In this study, the successful application of the workflow enabled us to determine the structural geometry along the drilled horizontal well and also build a 3D structural and property model which was successfully used for optimized frac staging and completion design along the lateral.|","Petrel, Optimized Completion, Horizontal, Delaware Basin, Wolfcamp Shale"

The Eagleford in US and Duvernay in Canada are examples of such liquids rich shale gas plays, which are being exploited to produce more profitable liquid hydrocarbons with natural gas. These reservoirs may store the liquid hydrocarbons in liquid state or in vapor state as with gas condensate systems. Further, shale gas reservoirs may contain significant volumes of organic matter, which stores gas (and liquid hydrocarbons) in the adsorbed state. Several previous studies have been performed with reservoir simulation tools to predict hydrocarbon production from these reservoirs under different conditions (relative permeability effects, fracture properties, geomechanical effects). In our literature review, we found that none of the studies addresses the desorption of liquids rich gases in shale gas reservoirs, although it has been suggested previously that this is an important storage mechanism. There are several methods to model equilibrium gas desorption in coal and shale reservoirs, including the popular Langmuir (for single-component gases) and Extended Langmuir methods (for multi-component gases). Assuming that hydrocarbon adsorption is restricted to organic matter sites in the shale matrix, its desorption and transport from the matrix can modeled using various methods which are investigated herein. In this work, the effects of heavy fraction desorption on liquids rich shale production are investigated using a commercial simulator. We use PVT data from previous studies to develop a compositional simulation model analog of a shale gas reservoir. Multi-component adsorption isotherms are used as an input in the simulator. Sensitivities are performed to investigate effects of different fluid compositions, heavy fraction adsorption amounts and matrix transport mechanisms on gas and liquid production and produced CGR.|","Simulation, Shale Gas Reservoirs, Unconventional Gas, Gas Desorption"

Improving the speed and accuracy of data exchange in model development can improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability of analyzing these models, ultimately supporting better decisions for asset development and economics over the life of a field. RESQML is an XML/HDF5-based, data-exchange specification that allows data to be transferred efficiently between the many different software packages used in subsurface modeling workflows. Key Version 2 enhancements include: a richer, more detailed RESQML data model with more domain data-objects (e.g., wells), and the ability to group related data-objects (e.g., faults, horizons, grids, etc.) and exchange them as a complete model. While these enhancements support more accurate and reliable models, they also presented challenges that were solved using new technological approaches for the RESQML data model design and the RESQML document exchanges. To design the richer yet more complex data model, the RESQML Special Interest Group (SIG) has moved from a hierarchical view of the data model to an entity-relationship view. The SIG is now using UML modeling tools to visualize the data model and produce both class and instance diagrams. The class diagrams are then used to generate XML schema definitions in a more automated and consistent manner. The Open Packaging Conventions_a container-file technology that stores a combination of files and their relationships to form a single entity for transfer in one compressed (ZIP) document format_are being used to group together independent data-objects (files) as a complete model.

Cold heavy-oil production with sand (CHOPS) is a nonthermalheavy-oil-recovery technique used primarily in the heavy-oil belt in easternAlberta, Canada, and western Saskatchewan, Canada. Under CHOPS, typicalrecovery factors are between 5 and 15%, with the average being less than 10%.This leaves approximately 90% of the oil in the ground after the processbecomes uneconomic, making CHOPS wells and fields prime candidates forenhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) follow-up process field optimization. CHOPS wellsshow an enhancement in production rates compared with conventional primaryproduction, which is explained by the formation of high-permeability channelsknown as wormholes. The formation of wormholes has been shown to exist inlaboratory experiments as well as field experiments conducted with fluoresceindyes. The major mechanisms for CHOPS production are foamy oil flow, sandfailure (or fluidization), and sand production. Foamy oil flow aids inmobilizing sand and reservoir fluids, leading to the formation of wormholes.Foamy oil behavior cannot be effectively modeled by conventionalpressure/volume/temperature (PVT) behavior. Here, a new well/wormhole model forCHOPS is proposed. The well/wormhole model uses a kinetic model to deal withfoamy oil behavior, and sand is mobilized because of sand failure determined bya minimum fluidization velocity. The individual wormholes are modeled in asimulator as an extension of a production well. The model grows thewell/wormhole dynamically within the reservoir according to a growth criterionset by the fluidization velocity of sand along the existing well/wormhole. Ifthe growth criterion is satisfied, the wormhole extends in the appropriatedirection; otherwise, production continues from the existing well/wormholeuntil the criterion is met. The proposed model incorporates sand production andreproduces the general production behavior of a typical CHOPS well.|","Document Type

Great focus is on the reservoir for obvious economic reasons, although most of the cost in the wellbore construction phase occurs above the reservoir, mainly driven by section length and sparse information on vital parameters for geomechanical analysis. There are two main points in a cost-effective geomechanical analysis: it needs to be performed without increased cost or delay in the progress of the well construction process, and the analysis needs to be accurate with the results fed back to the wellsite for implementation. For the first point the main issue is having appropriate, high-quality measurement in the drillstring to verify geomechanical models and adjust them according to new information such as unintentional drilling operational challenges that can be used to constrain the pressure window. Any geomechanical events have to be identified before developing into a non-productive time situation. The second point is the ability to continuously monitor and analyze the situation in a reliable manner and react on the information to ensure the correct measures are taken to mitigate the developing situation. Value in having the appropriate technology alongside the subject matter expert utilizing the optimum analysis processes is highlighted. This paper describes possible events of borehole-related collapse and how the automated process attempts to detect any wellbore stability issues. Utilizing remote operations to capture the event and deliver solutions for procedures that prevent or terminate the situation enables the operation to continue without increased risk or delay. The communication with the operational team is vital, and all work processes and command lines have to be clear and followed.

Several industry technologies support integrated operations, such as intelligent completions, real-time systems, surface-sub-surface models, and workflow automation systems, etc. Each of these technologies provides relevant data pertaining to one specific part the asset. The integration, correlation, and analysis of this data (current and historic) helps the operator understand the current state of the asset as well as make inferences about future behavior. Such capabilities are provided by a set of tools and techniques known within the industry as analytics. Operating and service companies are using new and improved analytics to support oil and gas operation and management processes. Additionally, several analytics commonly used in the foreign market are being applied to industry operation and management workflows. This has led to more robust and effective solutions for oil and gas production operations. However, the analytics value added is limited if implemented in an isolated fashion; the real value is obtained when analytics are immersed within comprehensive production workflows, aiding analysis, processing, and modeling of the production process. Workflows enhanced using analytics can transform integrated operations into intelligent operations. This paper presents analysis of how analytics have been applied to support integrated operations and demonstrates the value obtained when these tools are embedded into production workflows. To support this analysis, two case studies are described in which analytics are the main elements of advanced production monitoring and optimization workflows.|","Big Data, Analytics, Integrated Operations, Workflows, Digital Oil Field"

Other alternatives are either empirical correlations or conducting experiments mimicking field treatments. We adopted experimental approach considering scaling down of field conditions to laboratory scale by matching Reynolds number to represents flow along the facture and acid leak-off through fracture faces, and Pecelt number to represent acid transport to fracture walls. Experiments conducted comprise three stages: dynamic etching, surface characterization of etched cores and conductivity measurement. One objective of this work is to understand mechanism through which conductivity is generated in acid fracturing treatment. Moreover, the effect of initial condition of fracture surfaces on conductivity was investigated to quantify the difference between rough-walled and smooth-walled fractures. Another area of interest is the variation of conductivity along the fracture due to acid spending. In previous works, experiments only represented fracture entrance of actual treatment neglecting that acid is spent along the fracture which affects conductivity. Therefore, to better predicate the performance of an acid fracture, experiments at different acid concentrations representing different positions along the fracture were conducted. We also investigate effect of contact time, acid system type and treatment temperature on conductivity using San Andres Dolomite cores. Preliminary results showed that initial condition of fracture surface has a major influence on fracture conductivity where rough-walled fracture predicted higher conductivity by almost an order of magnitude compared to smooth-walled. And mechanism through which conductivity created is by smoothing peaks and valleys creating surfaces mismatch rather than creating asperities. Furthermore, results showed that acid spending does not necessarily cause a decrease in conductivity from entrance toward the tip of a fracture. Also, cross-linked acid is more effective in terms of dissolving rock and controlling fluid leak-off compared to linear gelled acid. Furthermore, more etching does not always translate to higher conductivity suggesting the existence of optimum contact time. Results obtained provide new insights to better understand and predicate conductivity of acid fracture and suggest guidelines to optimize treatment design.|","Acid Spending, Acid System Type, Initial Condition of Fracture Surface, Acid Fracture Conductivity"

One of the most significant methods for achieving higher productivity is to reduce the welding defects, which lead to repairs. Recently, the acceptable level of welding quality, especially the root pass, becomes higher and higher. This means minimizing misalignment between both pipe ends is required to get rid of welding defects triggers. On the contrary, the tolerances of commercially manufactured pipes have not been revised and shape fluctuation between both pipe ends is not ideal for welding condition. Various line-up clamp systems of pipes have been employed, however their control range is too limited to realize ideal alignment. To solve this problem fundamentally, authors have developed a pipe end forming equipment, to aim at perfect alignment between both pipe ends for girth welding. Applying the equipment, pipe ends are equalized in the shape, i.e. both diameter and roundness, and are fitted easily with each other for welding. The pipe end forming equipment has two additional features. One is Compactness. The compact design enables its easy installation onto the existing barge with minimum modifications. The other is quick processing. The processing duration does not cause any interruption for the cycle time of pipe laying operation. This shape equalization between both pipe ends leads to not only elimination of welding defects but also reduction of pipe fitting time prior to welding. We believe that the equipment will highly contribute to improve pipe laying productivity.|","Offshore pipeline, Pipe end forming, Construction"

Full understanding of the stress state in the earth, anisotropic rock mechanics and pore pressure is essential for safe, efficient drilling of the deviated development wells and production to their full potential. Understanding uncertainties in these parameters affects the economic production of these assets. A recent appraisal well in Hesss Bergading Field, drilled for a shallow sand, provided the opportunity to use it as a laboratory for future development. Full waveform sonic data, wellbore images, stress testing and full cores were gathered. Continuous estimates of anisotropic rock mechanical properties were compared and calibrated with core The 3 dimensional shear moduli were measured and continuous magnitudes of reservoir horizontal stress were obtained. Although the borehole itself was close to circular showing no break-out, larger than expected horizontal stresses were observed and the mini-frac failed to achieve breakdown at a pressure of 4500psi at 4000ft. State of the art sonic measurements providing shear radial-profiling from the sand-face into the far-field allowed direct derivation of horizontal stress magnitudes in the sand. These measurements also predicted a higher formation breakdown pressure than was applied in the mini-frac test.Application Well-bore stability, sanding and perforating all depend for their effective utilization on an understanding of the rock mechanics and state of stress of the material around the borehole.

Formation evaluation for this unconventional reservoir is not as straight forward because the evaluation program needs to be adjusted to obtain enough reservoir information for an effective field development plan. Application The Dual Packer Formation Testers (FT) can be used to test zones where matrix porosity is too low for a single probe FT such as carbonate and fracture basement reservoirs.

The mooring of floating systems can be problematic since significant vertical loading is imparted to the foundation systems. Consequently many different types of anchors have been developed to resist the pullout forces, and compared with conventional anchors SEPLA (suction embedded plate anchor) is more widely used because of its lower cost and shorter installation time. The vertical uplift capacity of plate anchors has been studied extensively. However most of the studies were based on theoretical and numerical analysis or tests in 1g conditions. In the present paper, 50g and 100g centrifuge model tests are performed to analyze the pull-out behavior of plate anchors in normally consolidated soft clay and the soil flow mechanism during the uplift process. The anchor is idealized as square in shape. Load-displacement curves and vertical pullout capacity are obtained in a series of wish-in-place tests. The contributing factors are also examined, with special attention paid on the anchor embedment ratio (H/B). Half-anchor tests are performed to study the soil movement patterns surrounding the anchor during the uplifting process, by using PIV (particle image velocity) method and the close range photogrammetry technique. Results are presented in the form of capacity factor (Nc) and are also compared with previous numerical and empirical solutions. Full-flow mechanism (soil flows around the anchor with local failure in shear) is observed in the half-anchor tests. This study with centrifuge model test provides insightful information on the uplifting pullout capacity of plate anchors as a part of foundation systems of floating platforms, as well as the flow and failure mechanism of surrounding soil.|","Plate Anchor, Normally Consolidated Clay, Vertical Pullout Behavior, Centrifuge Modelling"

For floating LNG plants, gaseous N2 refrigeration system is preferred due to the compactness of the refrigeration equipment and the less hazardous nature of gaseous N2 when compared with liquid hydrocarbon refrigeration system. Due to the low heat capacity of N2, companders (expander-compressor) are required to maximize the cooling duty instead of JT valves. Multiple compander units are required to handle the pre-cooling, liquefaction and sub-cooling of the natural gas. To provide process flexibility and equipment maintenance window, parallel N2 refrigeration trains are required for floating LNG plant. PETRONAS Floating LNG 1 facility will be the first floating plant in the world, utilizing only gaseous N2 as the refrigerant to produce LNG. The controllability of the N2 liquefaction is the main concern due to the large number of rotating equipment as well as load balancing the parallel N2 refrigeration trains. Specific analyses need to be conducted on the liquefaction system due to the complexity and highly interactive nature of the process, leading to possible process instability. An integrated dynamic model using PETRONASs iCON dynamic process simulation software was developed and utilized to conduct several operability studies, focusing on normal start-up and shut-down, refrigeration load switching from single to parallel N2 refrigeration trains, increase and decrease in LNG production, feed disturbance from production wells and equipment malfunction. Result shows that there is a highly interactive dynamic response between the companders and the heat exchangers due to the tight process integration. Disturbance to one compander may cause cascading effect through the other companders, which can cause compander overspeed or surge condition. This necessitates prudent analysis of the operating scenarios to ensure operability and carefully planned controller design for stable operation. Additionally, being the first such refrigeration configuration in the world, correction of perception that operation will be similar to the conventional hydrocarbon-based refrigeration LNG facilities is an issue to address.  |","Floating LNG, Parallel Refrigeration Train, N2 Refrigeration, Compander, MCHE"

Jamaal, PETRONAS Carigali","|This study demonstrate the utilization of wireline logs for pore pressure mechanism analysis in a field of southeastern Malay basin. Development of overpressures means that fluid movement in the pores is retarded both vertically and laterally. Detailed knowledge of lithology, rock history, and pressure mechanism is important for overpressure prediction. In many tertiary basins overpressure is mainly generated by compaction disequilibrium due to high deposition rate and low permeability in shales. In Malay basin, temperature also plays an important role in generating overpressure at shallow depth as geothermal gradient is very high 40-60 oC. Pore pressure data from 10 wells is used to for mechanism analysis. Overburden pressure is calculated for all the wells by using density log and sonic velocity-vertical effective stress, vertical effective stress-density and pore pressure cross plots are used for mechanism analysis. The results obtained from the cross plots reveal that in the study area overpressure is generated by both primary (undercompaction) and secondary mechanism such as chemical compaction and fluid expansion/hydrocarbon generation in different wells. Overpressure magnitude analysis suggests that overpressure generated due to secondary mechanism is very high as compare to primary mechanism. Eatons method with exponent 3 for sonic velocity under-predicted the pore pressure in the wells where both primary and secondary mechanism are present but in such wells pore pressures are reasonably predicted by using higher Eaton exponent. Overpressure behavior is very complex in the study area, in some wells it start at shallow depth and increase gradually with depth whereas in some wells it start at greater depth and ramp up quickly, this complex behavior also shows the presence of different mechanisms. For the safe drilling and completing the well economically, knowledge of overpressure is essential. Overpressure mechanism analysis is very important for overpressure prediction and it will help in understanding the behavior of pore pressure and applying the appropriate prediction method .?Accurate overpressure prediction is very important for construction of deep water seafloor facilities in HPHT environments.|","Mechanism, Overpressure, HPHT, Prediction, Compaction"

Higher average line tensions and fatigue loads can present uncertainty when assessing the capacity and qualification of the individual components. 
In 2011 and in response to a client request, SRP investigated the availability of compact subsea mooring connectors with high bending and tension fatigue capacity. An absence of results led SRP to explore the potential of cross-pollinating the technology from deepwater drilling and production riser systems to mooring systems. The reasoning being that steel risers can be subject to very high combined loading; weight limitations and fatigue life often motivate the designer to use high strength steels and efficient, fatigue resistant connections. This paper discusses the process and design considerations arising from adaptation of an existing and proven technology from one application (wellhead connectors) to a new application (subsea mooring connectors). The design verification and qualification test program being carried out in 2012 and 2013 are detailed as an example of a design teams interpretation of riser, mooring and new technology standards.

This paper describes the process and benefits of streaming down rigsite operational information and data on a real-time basis to the monitoring center. The Smart DOMC has become a center of excellence for domestic knowledge sharing, exchanging information, as well as a database of best practices, systematic trouble shooting, applied technologies, and capturing lessons learned.Very soon, the Smart DOMC will monitor all PETRONAS Carigali operations worldwide, which will encompass almost all drilling operations including land jobs, offshore operations, deep water, high pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT), carbonate drilling and unconventional technologies. These complex operations must be monitored and supported with robust infrastructures and competent manpower within the monitoring center. Operationally, high-resolution tools and sensors (surface and downhole) must be installed at the rig site for automatic data generation and transfer to the Smart DOMC by means of satellite. This information is segregated to produce reports related to wellbore integrity, formation evaluation, bottom hole assembly (BHA) performance, and drilling efficiency. Proprietary software is then used to transform digital data into presentable graphical formats for further evaluation and data storage. Implementation of such engineering and data surveillance were implemented in recent drilling campaigns in the Angsi Field, Sumandak, Tangga Barat, and Sepat projects. USD millions were saved by eliminating potential non-productive time (NPT) events and implementing efficient decision making. Obtaining accurate statistical data from each rigs operations allowed drilling management to reduce the NPT to barely minimum i.e., less than 5%.|","Database, Monitoring, Efficiency, Realtime, Drilling"

Previous simulation studies investigated the effects of well spacing and fracture length on well productivity in low-permeability oil and gas reservoirs. It was shown that the most important parameters for determining the optimum fracture length are the formation permeability and the stimulated reservoir volume. Although a number of studies have examined the performance of horizontal fractured wells and fracture geometry effect, fracture spacing and intersecting angles in vertical and horizontal wells should be further investigated. This study presents the results of a tight oil reservoir in the Bakken shale. Reservoir parameters considered include local rock stresses, rock compressibility, absolute and relative permeability, and porosity. The well-completion parameters included fracture length, height, width, conductivity, number and spacing between fractures, fracture intersecting angle, and cased vs. open-hole completion. Fracture modeling considered rigorous description of the hydraulic fracture properties and finite difference reservoir modeling. Economically attractive reserves recovery were modeled through multiple fracture placements in a 10,000 ft horizontal well. Numerical simulation showed that oil recovery increased between 8 to 15% while net present value (NPV) increased 8 to 24%, as the number of fractures increased. Based on the critical assumptions in the study (permeability, natural fracture distribution and stress orientation), an optimum number of fractures was identified. Open hole completions provided better performance in most cases, and recovery was greater for a higher number of contributing perpendicular vs. longitudinal fractures. The results of the study may hopefully be used to improve the understanding of the role of fracture geometry, spacing and open/cased-hole completion strategy to enhance operators optimum completion design.|","tight oil, multiple fracture completion, low permeability, finite difference simulation, fracture spacing"

It tops the table of costly NPT events ahead of items such as Well Control incidents, ""waiting on weather"", lost circulation, equipment failures and rig associated problems. The cost to the industry is estimated at several billions $USD per year. This is probably conservative and in the Gulf of Mexico alone in 2007, it was predicted to be 3% of the total spend on upstream oilfield equipment and services or $7.8 Billion (Dodson et al)1 . This can significantly affect drilling budgets where technical and operational risk must be balanced with potential return on Investment (ROI). The technological advance into extreme hostile territory, deepwater and HPHT, makes the investment and risk higher to the extent that some wells are left undeveloped. Deepwater wells are often incurring spread dayrates for services including the rig of $1M USD per day. Stuck pipe is a reality and the success of a recovery plan depends on a number of issues of which the most important is the efficient separation of the drillstring at the most beneficial point. Current separation technology is the same as it has been since the start of this industry albeit more advanced in its efficiency. Explosives or chemical cutting are still the only methods to separate the drillstring usually requiring mobilization of specialist equipment and personnel. This paper discusses the application and development of an integral circulation and disconnect tool. Additional to receiving downlinks to adjust a multi position circulating valve, it processes sensory information to establish the status, ""stuck"" or ""free"" and ultimately receives a command to disconnect from the BHA or wherever it is positioned in the string.

This shape memory polymeric material is molded to an initial geometric shape. The material is then heated and compacted to a smaller volume for run-in hole (RIH) geometry. As any shape memory polymer, it can recover its original shape if heated close to its Tg, or by chemically shifting its Tg to a new lower temperature that of its original Tg. This paper will present the results of additives added to completion fluids, giving the final fluid composition the ability to activate the polymer to its original shape, and simultaneously clean up the filter cake left by the drilling fluid before the polymer reaches the wellbore.

Acquiring this information would assist in the optimization of well trajectories to avoid these naturally fractured regions which would likely result in severe wellbore instability problems. As described by Petronas (1999&2007) the Malay Basin underwent an extensional phase during the Oligocene period with deposition of lacustrine source rocks. The Miocene was a time of fluvio-deltaic source and reservoir deposition and a compressional phase starting Early Miocene resulted in structural inversion. A major unconformity underlined the peak of the tectonic inversion in relation with the closure of Proto-South China Sea and the opening of South China Sea further to the North. In the Malay Basin, the geological history led to a complex structure trapping which requires further works and then an innovative approach based on the geomechanics was proposed to predict the locations containing natural fractures. The objective of the study was to model the heterogeneous paleo stress and strain states by the construction of a geomechanical model in this field and to relate the predicted strain and stresses to fracture characteristics. The first part of the study was to quality control the interpretation of the 3D structure of the area, which had been constructed from 3D seismic interpreted surfaces and faults. 1D Mechanical Earth Models computed from well data provided the required elastic parameters for the 3D structural restoration. The technique used to perform the restoration was based on the Finite Element Method, particularly suited for modeling complex geological structures. The second part of the study consisted in the computation of the paleo stress state via geomechanical forward modeling and relating the resulting plastic strain attributes with fracture density. In this step, the strains calculated from the displacements derived from the structural restoration were applied at the boundaries at each geological time-step in order to calculate the internal stress condition and plastic strain distribution accumulated through geological time.|","Forward Modeling, Geomechanics, Fracture, Structural restoration"

The permeability of coal is usually less than 1mD (1mD=1<U+00D7>10-3<U+03BC>m2), and is general 0.001~0.1mD in high rank coal reservoirs which are existed widely in China. Under super low permeability conditions, production practice of coal bed adsorption methane is obviously different from conventional gas. Different permeability of coal bed generates a considerable variance in the optimum condition for drilling and well completion and development technology. Therefore, permeability determination plays a very important role in CBM development. When the coal core permeability is lower than 0.01mD, conventional permeability test method is difficult to obtain accurate permeability measurement values. A permeability measuring instrument basing on the principle of pressure oscillation is designed in view of this difficulty. The coal sample is first stabilized at certain pore pressure, then a specific sinusoidal pressure wave is applied to the upstream side of the sample, and the pressure response at the downstream side is recorded. Permeability is deduced from the attenuation and phase variation of the downstream signal as it pass through a sample under test. The diameter range of sample is 50±0.5mm, which can better react the heterogeneous reservoir characteristics. The instrument which is equipped with drilling fluid pollution system can simulate downhole conditions and changes in permeability by drilling fluid pollution. The lowest permeability could reach 1<U+00D7>10-7mD. The permeability of coal samples which are from Sihe /Shanxi Province, Wuan /Hebei province and Gerick coal mine is measured with this instrument.

Instead of purely vertical loading during normal installation, the spudcan footing is subjected to eccentric and inclined loading arising from the combined effect of uneven seabed and shear strength variation in the vicinity of the footprint. Several mitigation measures have been proposed to alleviate this problem but so far only limited study has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these measures. Reaming, otherwise known as leg-working or leg reciprocation, is the mitigation measure considered in this paper. Very limited information is available in literature regarding the procedure of reaming. This paper will present the results from centrifuge model tests and large deformation finite element analysis in an attempt to systematically investigate the efficacy of reaming technique for jack-up re-installation close to existing footprint in normally consolidated clay. Several reaming strategies involving different amplitudes of leg penetration-extraction cycles were investigated. The induced vertical, horizontal and moment forces during reaming were compared with that of a generic spudcan re-installation. It is found that for reaming technique to be effective, reaming should be executed with small amplitude of penetration-extraction cycle. Moreover, the number of cycles for a particular leg penetration-extraction increment does not appear to play an important role in increasing the reaming effectiveness against footprint interaction. Back analysis using three-dimensional large deformation finite element analysis reveals a good agreement with centrifuge test data. This study using centrifuge model coupled with large deformation finite element analysis provides insightful information pertaining the mechanisms and efficacy of reaming as a mitigation measure for re-installation of jack-up close to existing footprints.|","Spudcan, Jack-up, Centrifuge and Numerical Modelling, Footprint, Reaming"

Original analysis and field trial results are presented. The data from the navigation sensors can be used to position and geo-reference the payload data, however, survey has relied upon expert piloting skills to maintain the WROV on a set course at a predetermined speed, heading and height from the seabed. In response to emergency situations, the equipment is hard to mobilise and the investment can be compromised if the WROV cannot be made to steer the course. This paper presents novel work in developing an autonomous control function suite integrated on a WROV to maintain a pre-laid course and offer a stable platform to gather data, and perform a task. Combined navigation functionality fuses data from GPS string, imaging sonars and a state-of-the-art phased array Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) with a Dynamic Positioning computer. Operators are equipped with the tools to survey and inspect their environment in a compact, easily deployable form factor. This development highlights vehicle and umbilical positioning, movement logging, advanced vehicle controls (sophisticated cruise, mission planning and object/target recognition modules) and increased reliability. The Dynamic Positioning computer translates high-level mission requirements from a surveyor into automatic thruster commands providing automatic inspection and survey.

In particular, two types of vibrations are of interest, torsional oscillation and backward whirl. Torsional oscillation ( stick / slip) is characterized by fluctuations in bit angular velocity. In extreme cases, the angular velocity can fall to zero or even reverse (CCW) direction, and reverse rotation is known to be detrimental to laminated cutters. In addition, backward whirl (lateral vibration), which refers to the counter-clockwise orbiting of bit center-of-rotation around the hole centerline, causes inefficient off-normal cutter movement and can lead to excessive cutter wear and fracture. In the current paper, the authors examine torsional oscillation data representing field and laboratory drilling events, and provide an alternative explanation for the observed reductions in drilling efficiency and durability. More specifically, the authors suggest that the likelihood of backward whirl with variations in angular velocity. At first, the hypothesis is evaluated by dynamic simulations and then validated through a series of torsional oscillation tests performed in the laboratory. To further substantiate the effect, the authors demonstrate how mechanical specific energy MSE and temperature rises when loading on PDC cutters varies from normal. This information is easily correlated with the dull conditions and damage to PDC cutters. The insight that stick / slip may include a backward whirl component can be used to guide the optimization of drilling parameters. This can be achieved in the field, either during operations if real-time in-bit sensing data are available or for offset well planning purposes if data are available in memory mode only. In either case, the likelihood of achieving performance objectives such as completing an interval (minimizing early terminations) and achieving target penetration rates are significantly improved.  |","Drilling Optimization, MSE, Vibration management, Backward Whirl, Stick Slip"

The main objective of this paper is to determine the effects of geomechanics on reservoir flow for the water alternating gas (WAG) process. The WAG injection pressure, temperature and the initial in-situ stress is important to determine the stress after the injection. The change in stress changes the porosity, permeability and subsequently the flow pattern changes. There are some methods to investigate the effects of geomechanics on reservoir simulation, as implicit, explicit, iterative and psudo-coupling method. In this study we use the iterative coupling method. In this type of coupling, reservoir flow variables and geomechanics variables are solved by a reservoir simulator and a geomechanics module, and the coupling terms are iterated on at each time step.

These wells have confirmed that Perdido has a high potential for commercial production. This reservoir was found in Lower Tertiary geological system.Applications  Problems incurred while drilling out from under the large casing sizes (22, 18, 16) with tandem hole enlargement bottom hole assemblies. Shallow reservoirs need to be evaluated for hydrocarbon potential, but these shallow hole sections are in very large hole sizes that require optimizing the drilling and formation evaluation. The objective here is to drill, evaluate and enlarge with the same BHA. During the same trip, the simultaneous enlargement of the hole is made to avoid a second under reaming trip (22, 20, 17 <U+00BD>, 16 <U+00BD>, 13 <U+00BD>). The shallow vertical depth of the reservoirs and the shallow geohazards requires a directional well design avoids the shallow hazards and the directional build section is intended to intersect the drilling target. An alternative strategy is to acquire the full suite of wireline logs in a dedicated 12 <U+00BC> pilot hole. Subsequently, an under-reaming trip is made for the hole enlargement. This second option is also very time consuming.Results The drilling group has evolved a tandem drilling assembly from traditional hole enlargements of 17<U+00BD>x20"" or 12<U+00BC>x 14 3/4"" to more complex simultaneous drilling and hole enlargements BHAs of 12 <U+00BC>x 16 <U+00BD>x20 or 12 <U+00BC>x14<U+00BD>x17 <U+00BD>.

Subsurface Containment Assurance involves the integrated efforts of subsurface (reservoir and overburden characterization), wells (planning, construction, well integrity and abandonment), operations (process safety and well operations and management of change) and HSE (health, safety and environment) teams. Disciplines must act together to develop and implement a surveillance plan to proactively monitor containment during well and injection operations in offshore fields. The paper will describe the elements of a Subsurface Containment Assurance Program (SCAP) that are required for business units operating offshore across the entire life cycle from exploration to mature developments. The program is designed to be comprehensive, yet flexible; and focuses on the critical elements and risks for individual operating units. A consistent framework needs to be created and implemented that draws from existing tools for reservoir and overburden characterization and field management, and combines these tools to reduce the risk of unintended subsurface fluid containment loss. Specific assessment criteria and ranking approaches and tools for qualitative and quantitative estimation of containment risks will be discussed. Finally, surveillance programs focusing on containment using both direct and indirect measurements will be highlighted with a focus on offshore data gathering. Loss of containment puts the environment, operating equipment and personnel at risk. Proactively identifying and mitigating containment risks is critical to operate safely.

Because of high drilling costs associated with the Changbei gas field, operators focus on improving drilling performance by means of reducing drilling and tripping times. One effective way to maximize drilling efficiency is proper bit selection. This paper presents an improved bit design and successful field results from two representative sections: CB 17-2 and CB18-2, both 12.25-in. sections. Both applications were characterized by a 2500-m long directional section, usually drilled through varying formations ranging from soft abrasive to very hard, with compressive strength ranging from 7 to 20 kpsi. Three main challenges were encountered during this operation. First, when drilling the upper portion of the sections, a series of transitional hard/soft formations, such as abrasive sandstone/siltstone and claystone, were encountered, which generated extensive vibrations and decreased the rate of penetration (ROP). Secondly, the long soft claystone intervals and frequent thin but very abrasive sandstone stringers in the lower part of the section not only increased bit balling potential, but also created premature cutter wear and loss of aggressiveness. The third challenge using a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit in this area related to drilling the whole section in fewer trips and maximizing the ROP to reduce drilling costs. To overcome these challenges, extensive geological research was performed within the 12.25-in. section of the Changbei gas field. Then, an improved bit design proposal was implemented, which consisted of three aspects: (1) apply new cutter technology to the bits, (2) optimize the bit design based on directional and formation challenges, and (3) develop optimum drilling parameters. Based on field results, this approach set both ROP and interval records compared to offsets and helped the operator save 3.26 drilling days_one trip and one bottomhole assembly (BHA) in Section CB17-2. Drilling efficiency for both sections was enhanced by more than 20% compared to offset wells. Furthermore, for both sections, the bit used exhibited improved dull conditions compared to offsets.|","Transitional Drilling, PDC Bit Design, Changbei Gas Field, Bit Balling, Abrasive Sandstone"

A methodology was developed to simplify, expedite and optimize remediation in response to a desire to close oily pits expeditiously. Protocol development commenced with a lookback at over 300 pit closure projects to identify successful practices and improvement opportunities. The protocol was designed to eliminate historical process bottlenecks, incorporate recent advances in site characterization and remediation techniques, and embody the collective experience gained. The first step of the protocol is to compile an inventory of oily pits. A simple qualitative assessment addressing key drivers of potential risk is then used to prioritize the pits for characterization. Contrary to expectation, the lookback revealed that characterization generally constituted the longest-duration phase of pit closure. Recent advances in sampling and analysis technologies as well as value-of-information prompts were incorporated into the methodology to keep the characterization phase decision driven. Pit inactivation and content removal activities were included as part of the characterization step to enable full access for sampling. The lookback also indicated that two onsite treatment methods were used successfully to remediate hydrocarbon-impacted soil at about 90% of the locations. Simple predictive algorithms were derived to enable desktop evaluation of the feasibility of these two methods for a given pit, expediting remedial decision making. Land reclamation performed after remediation restores the area of the closed pit and renders it suitable for future use. Best practices in backfill profile design and revegetation were incorporated into the reclamation methodology. The protocols objective is to produce a reclaimed pit area restored in such a way so as to be virtually indistinguishable in condition and function from the surrounding land.

In recent years there has been an explosion of initiatives calling for private sector organisations to report on health, safety, environmental, social and governance factors. As increasing numbers of policy makers, governments and stock exchanges are embedding sustainability into policy and regulation through mandatory reporting initiatives, many civil society organisations, research institutions and investors are also launching voluntary reporting frameworks. Many Oil & Gas companies have been dedicating significant resources to producing yearly sustainability reports for a long time. These reports have been used as a way to measure performance and communicate with stakeholders. However, companies are now increasingly being asked for additional information, or the same information presented in different ways, by growing numbers of external organisations. Each individual request for information presents its own unique challenge to companies, but the reality is that stakeholder expectations, maintaining a societal licence to operate, as well as pressure from the investor community and the reputational risks make it difficult not to respond to such new requests, particularly for companies in the Oil & Gas sector. Increasingly, significant company resources are being expended on providing information, both qualitative and quantitative, and in completing surveys and questionnaires, in particular from ESG rating agencies, instead of focusing on performance improvement itself. The recent growth of mandatory reporting initiatives globally has not served to halt the proliferation of voluntary initiatives. Furthermore, many of the voluntary reporting schemes require increasing levels of complex information year after year without clear explanations of why a reasonable investor or analyst would need such information. There is also a gap in the evidence that demonstrates the link between reporting extensive levels of information and good performance or even performance improvements. In this context this paper will examine and compare a number of voluntary reporting initiatives including the: - GRI G4 framework - GRI Oil & Gas Sector Supplement - IPIECA, API and OGP Oil & Gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting - UN Global Compact principles - International Integrated Reporting Council framework - CDP - Sustainability Accounting Standards Board - Global Initiative for Sustainability Ratings|","measuring, reporting, performance, sustainability"

It is a shape memory polymer with the capability to change geometric shapes. This shape memory polymeric material is molded to an initial geometric shape. The material is then heated and compacted to a smaller volume, 25% of initial volume compacted, for run-in hole (RIH) geometry. As any shape memory polymer, it can recover its original shape if heated close to its Tg, or by temporarily chemically shifting its Tg to a new lower temperature that of its original Tg. This paper will present the results of additives added to completion fluids, giving the final fluid composition the ability to activate the polymer to its original shape, and simultaneously clean up the filter cake left by the drilling fluid before the polymer reaches the wellbore. The fluid is designed so that the time to activate the polymer and the time to break the filter cakes are both controlled at will. The additives are delayed so the filter cake retains fluid loss properties during activation, but breaks shortly after the polymer reaches the gauge-hole there by allowing for production at maximum flow rates.|","sand control systems"

Existing solutions are mainly based on particulates and are often added to drilling fluids to plug fractures or build up filtercake to cure losses. When applied for curing losses in reservoir sections, it is desirable that the plugging materials self-degrade to leave undamaged formation for hydrocarbon production while maintaining sufficient stability to allow well completion. The main challenge is designing the lost circulation material to provide plug stability and cleanup within a desired time frame over a broad bottomhole temperature range. Fiber-laden fluids have shown good fracture plugging behavior, depending on fluid velocity and flow rate. To apply this concept to lost circulation applications, we designed a novel, fiber-laden fluid that can easily be prepared on surface, allowing compatibility with bottomhole assemblies at high flow rate. Once inside the fracture, in conjunction with the decrease in velocity, fibers bridge and then plug the fracture, thus regaining circulation. The plug is formed by compacted fibers and particles, creating a strong structure inside the fracture. Depending on the flow rate and the fracture aperture, the plugging can happen anywhere inside the fracture from a few inches to a few feet from the wellbore. This makes the formed plug more resistant against further drilling, reaming and casing or tool running operations. One of the main novelties of the system comes from the fibers that are specially designed to degrade in an adjustable time scale sufficient to ensure plug stability until the well is completed. With time, the plug undergoes further degradation, leading to nondamaged formation for production. The novel degradable solution has been successfully applied to three cases of total losses. In the first application, 75 barrels were prepared and pumped through the bottomhole assembly without recorded pressure increase, indicating good pumpability. Full circulation was restored and the well was drilled to completion. The two other applications cured total losses in reservoir sections of a carbonate formation by pumping 50-barrel pills through open ended drillpipe. All plugs were designed to degrade within 7 to 10 days, the time required to complete the section drilled.|","Reservoir, Degradable, Lost Circulation"

The recorded leak off pressure (LOP) primarily establishes the upper mud weight (MW) limit for the next hole section.  Field-wide LOP data usually show some spread at a given depth. Lower bound trend of LOP data is used as the base case for fracture pressure prediction and planning of future wells. For the field under study, LOPs obtained at the 9 5/8 casing shoe show a scatter of 800 psi (2 ppg MW equivalent). The average depth of the casing shoe is ~7900 ft and the LOPs are spread over a depth interval of only 260 ft. In such a situation, taking the lower bound of LOP data for fracture gradient estimation may lead to an overly conservative well design. From a drilling perspective, narrow margin drilling conditions would be invoked in what is really not a narrow drilling window situation. The study investigated the scatter in the LOPs to understand the cause in terms of rock mechanics, well trajectory and in-situ stresses. The study indicated that LOPs measured in inclined wells may need an adjustment prior to use for predicting fracture pressures for future wells with a different inclination or azimuth. The reported LOPs are from boreholes scattered over the field having an inclination of ~45<U+00BA> and varying azimuths. Attempts to understand the scatter in terms of subtle differences in lithology and pore pressures at the casing shoe failed. However, a careful analysis of the well trajectory with respect to the orientation of in-situ stresses successfully explained the differences in measured LOP values, assuming they represent initiation of new tensile fractures rather than leak-off into existing fractures. The field is in normal faulting stress regime with anisotropic horizontal stresses. In such cases, the stress redistribution around a borehole is strongly influenced by the borehole geometry. To cause a leak-off in an unfractured intact formation, the bottom-hole pressure must overcome the tensile strength and the minimum principal stress around the borehole. Due to stress redistribution, inclined wells in the direction of Shmin yield higher LOPs compared to near-vertical wells or inclined wells in other orientations. For a given stress state and rock strength, different LOPs can be expected solely based on the trajectory of the inclined borehole w.r.t. in-situ stresses. This study highlights the caution needed in interpreting LOP values in inclined wells drilled in different azimuths. Depending on horizontal stresses anisotropy, LOP measured in inclined wells may need a careful scrutiny of the trajectory vis-a-vis stress direction before consideration in well design for new wells. Understanding tolerance of well trajectory to losses can help us drill deeper and safer.|","leak off test, drilling window, fracture gradient, narrow margin drilling, well design"

One of these faced by drillers is lost circulation of drilling fluids which can lead to bigger issues such as differential stuck pipe and well control events. Field applications show that wellbore strengthening effectively helps reduce mud loss volume by increasing the safe mud weight window. Both conventional and Casing while Drilling (CwD) applications are considered in this study. For conventional drilling the strengthening mechanism is executed via drilling fluid and the particulate system within. In a more advanced case, for CwD the mechanical contact of the pipe with the wellbore plays a role in increasing wellbore pressure containment as well. The mechanism builds a layer of low permeability material on wellbore wall (external mud cake), blocks the pores near wellbore wall and creates a non-porous layer of rock (internal mud cake), increases the mud temperature, and forces grains to plug the induced fracture (inhibiting further growth and propagation). Hence, an integrated tool is required to effectively realize and quantify effect of each benefit. The aim of current study is to provide a geomechanical tool to analyze stress evaluation around wellbore for strengthening applications. First a review of existing strengthening techniques are discussed and summarized. Then an integrated geomechanics workflow that incorporates poro-thermo-elastic algorithms is introduced. Wellbore strengthening scenarios are simulated through this workflow using analytical solutions and field data. This approach provides a comprehensive perspective on the currently used formulation and how it is applicable during drilling operation. Utilizing fully transient thermo-poro-elastic model, the effects of external and internal mud cake and temperature effects on the near-wellbore stresses are quantified. This integrated workflow provides a suitable tool for designing Lost Circulation Materials (LCM) and helps achieve customized strengthening design when drilling through depleted zones.|","Wellbore Strengthening, Casing while Drilling, Lost Circulation Material, Fracture Width Distribution, Particle Size Distribution"

In addition, a beneficial casing smear effect (CSE) has been observed in recent years during drilling with casing (DWC) operations, preventing lost circulation even when drilling highly depleted formations. CSE mimics WBS effects observed during regular drilling operations in its ability to effectively extend fracture gradients and prevent lost circulation, which is of great benefit to drilling difficult wells with tight drilling margins such as (ultra-)deepwater wells. In fact, when used appropriately, WBS and CSE may offer well construction benefits that are on par with those of managed pressure drilling (MPD) and dual gradient drilling (DGD), at reduced equipment usage, complexity and cost. To explain WBS and CSE phenomena, a variety of different mechanisms have been proposed. These broadly fall into three categories: (1) Wellbore Face Sealing (WFS) - forming a uniform seal around the wellbore that prevents fluid leak-off and interferes with fracturing; (2) Wellbore Stress Augmentation (WSA) - augmenting the closure stress around the wellbore by propping open induced fractures either at the wellbore face or somewhere into the fracture; (3) Fracture Propagation Resistance (FPR) - effective solids plugging of any fracture tip, thereby interfering with effective fracture growth. In the proposed paper, we offer a re-examination of previously published data (such as open-hole leak-off tests) and theoretical results, and present our own independent results and assessments to show that WBS and CSE have a common, unified origin. It will be shown that the only mechanism that explains all the data obtained to date is, in fact, the FPR mechanism. Moreover, guidelines will be presented to exploit FPR optimally for the benefit of future complex well construction, such as ultra-deepwater wells with tight drilling margins.|","Casing Smear, Fracture Gradient, Drilling Margin, Wellbore Strengthening, Fracture Propagation"

Recent investigations reported by the authors determined that the design of Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bits has a significant influence on stick/slip behavior of the drilling systems. Among various bit design methodologies, a depth-of-cut (DOC) control technique has emerged as an effective way of mitigating bit-induced stick/slip. The research reported in this paper aims at enhancing this technique to accurately identify the optimal application of DOC control to maximize reliability and performance. A comprehensive testing program on a full-scale research rig was undertaken to characterize the optimal type, positioning, and extent of DOC control required for mitigating stick/slip. Several PDC bits incorporating strategically configured DOC control elements were designed and tested. The stick/slip tendencies of bits were determined based on diagnostics from downhole drilling dynamics monitoring devices while the surface operating parameters were varied in a controlled manner. Tests indicate that certain DOC control characteristics are most effective in mitigating stick/slip. While under-application of DOC control does not help mitigate stick/slip, over-application hurts performance without mitigating stick/slip. Formation type plays a major role in instigating stick/slip, and is a significant factor in designing DOC control. The paper presents analysis details, and proposes design guidelines based on testing in multiple formations within three research wells. These design guidelines are also supported by field evidence from UK, where statistics on many bit runs indicate superior performance with properly tuned DOC control.|","Development and Testing, PDC Bits, Stick Slip, Mitigating Stick/Slip, Optimum Depth-of-Cut-Control"

Furthermore, the interaction between the drilling mud and host rock has to be considered when drilling in shales. The mud fluid pressure diffusion into the rock can have significant impact on the wellbore stability if the permeability of the rock matrix is high. The mud fluid can still penetrate/invade into the weak planes even if the rock matrix has ultra-low permeability. The pressure diffusion will change the effective stress near the wellbore thus directly influence the wellbore stability. The fluid penetration/invasion in the bedding planes can induce shearing slippage along the bedding planes/microfractures and/or cause rock strength deteriorated, thus leihading to wellbore instability.Application It is very challenging to work out analytical solutions for stress distribution and strength limit around the wellbore with all the aforementioned effects included, numerical modeling approach has to be used instead. Actually, most major issues encountered in the drilling through shales can be resolved in numerical simulation, i.e., the rock material can be realistically represented as anisotropic, heterogeneous material with nonlinear elastic-plastic constitutive behavior. The bedding planes can be included in the model directly. The significance of fluid penetration and fluid diffusion can be evaluated by performing fluid-mechanical coupling analysis. The strengthening or weakening effect of chemical additives can also be considered by realistically varying material strength as functions of time, mud pressure or any other parameters. The wellbore stability is assessed by solving equilibrium equations and constitutive laws at every point in the problem domain in real time so the inertial and transient effects are strictly respected.Results, Observations, and Conclusions The numerical code is validated in a couple of classic borehole problems. The collapsed borehole at the depth of 1200 m in the Maastrichtian shale in the North Sea field is revisited as a case study. The originally designed mud weight is assessed in the numerical model and a new mud weight is recalculated with impacts of microfractrues and bedding planes considered. The safe drilling of sidetrack wells in the Maastrichtian shale is achieved with the recalculated safe mud window.Significance The bedding planes, anisotropic elasticity, time-dependent mechanical behavior introduced by fluid-mechanical interaction and rheology of rock formations, strength hardening/softening, etc. have tremendous impacts on the mud weight selection for safe drilling through shale. This work shows that a numerical code which can accommodate all these factors is a suitable tool for calculating safe mud weight with the said complications considered.|","fluid penetration, bedding planes, numerical modeling, safe mud weight window, wellbore stability"

The paper describes an analysis of the spiraling observed in four wells. The analysis relies on a novel borehole propagation model that results from considerations involving (i) a bit/rock interaction law linking the forces acting on the bit to its penetrations, (ii) kinematics relationships relating the bit motion to the local borehole geometry, and (iii) a beam model to determine the lateral force and moment at the bit resulting from the deflection of the BHA imposed by the stabilizers. The model leads to the formulation of a set of delay differential equations to evolve the borehole inclination and azimuth, with the configuration of the BHA embodied in the coefficients of the equations. The spatial delays reflect the borehole trajectory feedback introduced by the stabilizers. Application. The analytical form of the evolution equations makes it possible to determine, via a linear stability analysis, the conditions leading to spiraling of the borehole. Results, Observations, and Conclusions. The stability of the system depends essentially on the magnitude of a dimensionless parameter (the product of a bit property measuring its lateral steerability and the scaled weight-on-bit, reduced to account for the bit wear) in relation to a critical value, function of the positions of the stabilizers. The system is unstable, i.e. spiraling of the borehole is likely to occur, if this dimensionless quantity is less than the bifurcation value. The equations indicate that instability is promoted by a shorter bit gauge, an increase of the bit wear, or a reduction of the weight-on-bit. This method has been validated with downhole data from four wells. In total, three vertical sections, an inclined section drilled with a BHA is equipped with a push-the-bit RSS system, and three building sections (two with a point-the-bit and one with a push-the-bit system) have been analyzed. For each of them, the model accurately predicts the appearance of spiraling. Significance of subject matter. Borehole spiraling impairs borehole quality, hampers well logging, reduces penetration rates, compromises zonal isolation, and delays well completions. Using field data from four boreholes, this paper shows that spiraling can be predicted by studying the stability of the directional drilling system. The model can thus be used at the design stage to predict the stability features of a system and prevent or limit the appearance of borehole spiraling.|","modeling, spiraling, Borehole instability, Directional drilling, rippling"

Bit damage while drilling offshore is costly, and any improvement in bit life can save multiple unplanned trips and lead to savings for operators. Consequently, dynamic dysfunctions have been the focus of industry research to understand and mitigate their effects. In this paper the authors present a field case study from an offshore application. A high-frequency, in-bit sensing device (1400-Hz sampling frequency) was installed into the bit shank in conjunction with a well-established measurement while drilling (MWD) tool in the BHA. The intent was to capture the dynamics behavior of the BHA and the dynamics directly at the bit. Multiple measurements along the BHA gave a better understanding of the behavior of the entire drilling system. The measurements were then used, along with dynamics modeling and simulation, to correlate bit and cutter damages with instances of backward whirl and stick/slip. The developed kinematic model of whirl corroborated well with measurements and showed how polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutters can exhibit relative backward motion that potentially leads to severe cutter damage. The extended frequency range of the measurement module also enabled the capture of new dynamics phenomena at much higher frequencies than are usually reported in the literature. The insights gained in bit dynamics and cutter damage helped to improve bit design by building dynamically stable PDC bits with increased rate of penetration (ROP) and reduced NPT. The need for high-frequency measurements is also discussed and the benefits are shown, i.e., avoiding bit design iterations around misunderstood vibration issues. In todays challenging drilling applications, these measurements are important in characterizing the harsh drilling environment and understanding high-frequency dynamics phenomena that have previously been rarely measured or discussed.|","Drilling optimization, Modeling, PDC bit, Dynamics, High Frequency Measurement"

These are staffed on a full-time basis with specialist monitoring teams and are supported by an extensive integrated communications infrastructure. The proposed paper addresses the problem faced by an operator working on a much smaller scale needing to provide a few rigs with the benefits of real-time support technologies through high quality communications and a clearly defined workflow involving collaborative working between the rig, operations office and the head office in Europe. The paper will describe how the real-time systems were implemented for a number of global drilling operations without installing a real time operation center. A case study of implementation in one area will be presented. The paper will describe how this approach enabled the decision makers in the field to access the experience of and support from the rest of the organization. The global real time collaboration environment allowed the specialists to direct their attention, as required, to operations most in need of support at any particular time. By not installing a real-time operations center, the organization saved resources and encouraged the local teams to use the analysis tools themselves to manage their operational performance. The head office organization provided technical and administrative support. It facilitated the design of the workflows and set common standards for the IT and communications architecture. The workflows were essential in order to create a structure for using the software tools within a local drilling team and to make sure that problems were detected as early as possible. The workflows aimed to strike a balance between not allowing early warning signals to be overlooked while giving the operations team the freedom to responsibly manage the operation on the rig. Through the way that the system and the workflows were used on a daily basis, the rig personnel gained confidence that the system was set up purely to support them and for their benefit. The design and the implementation of these workflows utilized industry-leading real time drilling data analysis and drilling support tools. When difficult operational problems were encountered, by acting as a knowledge broker, the central organization drew from its world-wide skill pool to organize problem-specific multi-disciplinary support for problem-solving, peer review and functional sign-off for program changes.

Description of the material: Wellbore strengthening are techniques to increase the mud weight window by adding lost circulation materials (LCM) to drilling fluids. Several hundred tests have been performed to investigate the applicability, effectiveness and engineering of various strengthening wellbore techniques. The experimental techniques included simulated fractures by two plates or sandstone blocks with a borehole. In the block test, two independent stresses were applied to the block faces parallel to the wellbore, which simulated horizontal stress anisotropy under downhole conditions. Drilling fluid, with and without LCM, was pumped into the wellbore to simulate breakdown, mud loss, and fracture sealing. The types of tests performed include:  Breakdown down tests under different stress anisotropy and magnitude to establish the baseline results and to validate the results with rock mechanics  Remedial treatment with LCM added after breakdown when fractures are induced, and preventive treatment with background LCM in active mud to study effectiveness of preventive versus remedial treatments  Fracture sealing and strengthening of induced fractures versus pre-fractured rock blocks of different fracture apertures. 2. Application: To increase the mud weight window and to allow drilling of otherwise un-drillable wells without lost circulation or well control issues. 3. Results, Observations, and Conclusions: Some of the results, observations and conclusions from the several thousand tests are: 1) if the LCM blending and concentration are designed correctly, the fracture sealing pressure is always higher than the breakdown pressure; 2) preventive treatment is more effective than remedial treatment, especially for depleted formations; 3) filter-cake quality appears to have a strong effect, which is consistent with model predictions; 4) minimum LCM concentration are required to quickly form a seal strong enough for a given fracture aperture; 5) recommendations on LCM sizing and concentration for given fracture apertures. 4.

Pore pressure prediction is a key aspect in well design, and it often proves to be one of the most difficult components to accurately access. With oil and gas plays moving to increasingly less conventional drilling environments, there is a great industry wide need to enhance our pore pressure modeling techniques. To address this issue, an analysis of pore pressure prediction methodology accuracy has been conducted. The relatively new seismic frequency based methodology for pore pressure prediction is presented and compared to other, more commonly applied seismic interval velocity and petrophysical methods. The analysis is carried out for a development field in Mississippi Canyon, Gulf of Mexico (Fig 1). The study includes pore pressure gradient generation by use of petrophysical and seismic methods for key offset wells and two proposed wells in a near salt proximity environment. For the first time in the literature, the accuracy of the commonly accepted, seismic interval velocity based and the relatively new, seismic frequency based methodologies for pore pressure prediction are quantitatively compared. Quantified results are based on conformance to the calibration parameters used in key offset wells, the mudweights used in blind-test control wells, and the petrophysically derived pore pressure curves for the two proposed wells in this development field, showing higher reliability in the frequency based approach. Additionally, the interval velocity method yielded erroneous results in a fast-rock-velocity channel zone (Fig 2) and the near salt proximity environments, whereas the frequency based method appeared unaffected by either of these factors. The seismic frequency based method had higher accuracy in all three (3) well groups: key offset wells, control offset wells, and proposed well locations.|","Sub-Salt, Interval Velocity Pore Pressure, Frequency Based Pore Pressure"

Traditionally, analysis of thermal fracturing was conducted by heating the cutter to the fracture point in normal atmospheric or vacuum/inert conditions, and then allowing it to cool down and polishing it for easy observation prior to microscopic analysis. This method limits findings, as the environmental conditions do not accurately reflect those experienced downhole, and this process does not allow for an in-depth understanding of the precise fracturing behavior of the cutter. To gain a more in-depth understanding of thermal fracturing behavior and its causes, a specialized environment was prepared that allowed in-situ observations of fracturing behavior in simulated drilling conditions. This included equipping a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with a hot-stage furnace accessory to allow for real-time observations, and filling the chamber with a simulated atmosphere consistent with downhole conditions. Cutter cross-sections were selected and polished using new methods to ensure maximum clarity and then heated to fracturing temperatures, with the SEM recording all changes as they occurred. The observed thermal fracturing behavior, analysis of the microstructure degradation and EDS chemical analysis led to some valuable insights into cutter failure mechanisms. In unleached areas of the cutters, fracturing began at significantly higher temperatures than expected, while the cobalt binder compound began melting at lower temperatures than generally believed. In addition, fracturing behavior was not universal, but a few major cracks initially appeared in the PDC structure, from which a network of smaller cracks progressed outwards through the cutter. With deep leached cutters, microcracking appeared in the diamond grains rather than intergranular fracturing, degrading the integrity of the cutter and indicating that graphitization, not fracturing, is the primary thermal failure mechanism of deep leach cutters. The data from these tests provide valuable insights into how PDC cutter and deep leach technology can be effectively used in the field. Due to the lower melting point of the cobalt binder compound, the temperatures used in manufacturing can be adjusted to ensure maximum cutter stability. Also, this demonstrates a greater-than-expected wear resistance for deep leach cutters, and a higher fracturing or degradation temperature of both unleached and deep leached cutters, meaning that they are suitable for a wider range of applications.|","drilling bits, PDC Cutters, Thermal Failure or degradation, environmental scanning electron microscope, In-situ observations"

Although proved beneficial and economic for thin reservoirs, the cold heavy-oil production with sand (CHOPS) method has several limitations. The sand produced during CHOPS changes the geomechanical and petrophysical properties continuously and results in open channels in the reservoir known as wormholes. Also, the CHOPS method results in a low oil recovery (810% original oil in place). This entails a follow-up enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) process, which is always an option for further exploitation, referred to as post-CHOPS. Assessment of such a process through numerical simulation, as the most inexpensive yet most powerful tool, necessitates a comprehensive modelling approach to capture its dynamic physical nature. Only through such a realistic model can one obtain reasonably reliable reservoir characteristics after CHOPS that are critically important to assess post-CHOPS applications. To this end, we implemented a fractal pattern of different kinds by use of a diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) algorithm as wormhole domain with a partial dual-porosity approach and a step-by-step simulation technique, taking advantage of a simple mathematical model to integrate the sand-production data with fractal patterns. The wormhole network is assumed to grow with more sand production, respecting geological conditions and well perforation. Moreover, its effective properties and the contained fluid can be controlled along its length and pattern at different steps. Such an option is of great assistance in the history-matching process. The model was validated successfully with available Alberta field data. As a preliminary step to post-CHOPS, several thermal, solvent, and hybrid combinations of both scenarios were considered. The proposed method for CHOPS modelling is a useful approach to initiate a quick post-CHOPS study in practice if sand production history is provided. One may also take advantage of its compatibility with any black-oil, compositional, or thermal simulators.|","wormhole modeling, post-CHOPS EOR, dual-porosity model, steam/solvent injection, fractals"

Roof bolting in coal mines began on a modest scale in the early 1950s. Since then, the design of bolts, grout systems, accessories and installation techniques has improved significantly. Currently, roof bolting is the primary means of supporting mine roof in room-and-pillar operations in the bituminous coal sector. Although roof support systems have improved greatly, roof falls continue to occur in bolted areas. Design and maintenance of ad-equate support systems is essential for ensuring ground stability and preventing roof falls.

Most injury-causing roof falls involve falls of small chunks of roof rock from the immediate roof beam (Robertson & Hinshaw, 2002). MSHA (2010) data indicate that noninjury roof falls are often large and could comprise an entire intersection or extend to an entire pillar length.|The large body of noninjury roof fall reports provides an opportunity to gain insight into the characteristics of roof falls in coal mines.

During methane-hydrate production in offshore deepwater seabeds, there are concerns about the settlement of the seabed and the possibility that negative friction will occur along the production well. However, frictional properties of a deepwater well structure are not investigated. Here, friction tests were conducted on interfacial boundaries among a steel rod and sand and a steel rod and cement under high confining pressure. Three types of steel rods with different surface roughness, two types of silica sand with different particle sizes, and cement were used. A steel rod confined by compacted sand or hardened cement was pushed out at a constant displacement rate. The tests show that frictional strength of two kinds of interfacial boundaries increased linearly with confining pressure. In addition, the results confirmed the effective friction angle of the interface between a steel rod and sand and the cohesion of the interface between the steel rod and cement increases with the surface roughness of the steel rod.|","friction, methane hydrate, well, roughness, effective confining pressure"

Steam processes have dominated the in situ recovery of this resource, but steam/ solvent and solvent-only processes are currently being field tested. Steam processes, especially low-pressure processes such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), are challenged by both a high degree of geologic heterogeneity and thin pay zones. |In-Situ Mining of Oil Sands |The very shallow (less than 70-m) depth of a large portion of the oil-sand deposits of Canada has made their surface mining a technically feasible and economical method of recovering the bitumen from the shallowest portion of the oil sands. The success of surface mining for bitumen has led others to propose and test in-situ bitumen mining processes. Hydraulic mining of the oil sands from a borehole has a rich patent literature but few conclusive field tests. The basic concept is that a high-pressure, downhole water jet could disrupt the unconsolidated sand matrix around the wellbore such that a bitumen/water/sand slurry could then be produced to the surface for bitumen extraction with surface-mining techniques. The process is technically challenged by the limited volume of hydrocarbons that can be recovered from any given wellbore and the limited cavern size that can be supported without roof collapse in these unconsolidated sand/shale geologic environments.|","Document Type

Shale-gas production has gained worldwide attention over the past several years. Production from shale-gas reservoirs requires horizontal drilling with multiple hydraulic fracturing to obtain the most economical production. However, there are high cost and uncertainty because of many inestimable and uncertain parameters (e.g., reservoir permeability, porosity, fracture spacing, fracture half length,fracture conductivity, gas desorption, geomechanics, and existing natural fractures). Therefore, the development of a way to quantify uncertainties and optimization of shale-gas production in an efficient and practical method is clearly desirable. In this paper, we present a user-friendly and efficient framework to obtain the optimal gas-production scenario by optimizing the uncertain factors by integrating several commercial simulators, an economic model, design of experiment (DoE), and response-surface methodology (RSM) with a global optimization search engine. Specifically, we use factorial design to screen insignificant factors and find the most influential design and uncertain factors; then, we use RSM to design over those most influential factors to fit a response surface using net present value (NPV) as the objective function; finally, we identify the most economical production scenario under conditions of uncertainty. Eight uncertain parameters [i.e., porosity, permeability, reservoir thickness, reservoir pressure, bottomhole pressure (BHP), fracture spacing, fracture half-length, and fracture conductivity] with a reasonable range on the basis of Barnett-shale information are investigated. Also, different gas prices are considered for the optimization process. This framework is effective and efficient for hydraulic-fracturing- treatment design and production-scheme optimization in unconventional gas reservoirs. It can contribute to providing guidance for engineers to modify the design of a hydraulic-fracture treatment before the actual fracture treatment.|","design of experiment, response surface methodology, shale gas, uncertainty analysis, optimization"

Wells in the Cantarell field, a mature depleted field in the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico, are facing drastic decreases in their production and, depending on producing zone, an increase in either water cut or gas/oil ratio. Other developed fields in Mexicos Region Marina, such as the Ku-Maloob-Zaap, have constantly increased their hydrocarbon production through the years with an incipient increase in water and gas increments. 
The high water cut and gas increments have had a strong impact on the production strategy, opening the opportunity for application of non-conventional, innovative, and engineered solutions to isolate or abandon production intervals invaded by gas or water and continue production from upper or deeper zones. The pay zones consist of naturally fractured, vugular carbonates with permeability as high as 5 Darcies, from Paleocene, Cretaceous, and Jurassic formations. Their characteristics present the following challenges that need to be overcome to succesfully achieve the required isolation:

Such algorithms should be based on a reliable model of motion and interaction of the fluids and pore space. This joint general deformation model should be approximated to obtain a number of reduced models that one can use for less-accurate but quick calculation of the near wellbore parameters. The objective of our research is to study the stress-deformed state of a porous medium saturated with fluids with the basic assumption that there is a number of different spatial scales porous medium deformation and fluid filtration flow. The general model is based on the principles of continuum mechanics and deformation of interpenetration continuums. A small parameter expansion method is applied for a dimensionless equation system. This method will use a relation of the spatial scales of deformation of the solid components and fluid flow. The coupled models of fluid filtration in deformed media can be widely applied in the oil and gas industry, mining, medicine and hydrogeology. The approximated models can be used in software products for fast estimation of wellbore stability. An initial sequence of models has been determined, corresponding to different approximations for the small parameter, where the zero-approximation model describes constant-volume deformation of a porous material. In this case the porous-pressure equation is separated from the matrix-deformation model. For the zero-approximation a number of analytical solutions were obtained in particular, in cylindrical coordinates, to describe the stress-deformed state around a vertical well. These solutions contain the non-zero shear stresses able to cause the formation damage. The first-approximation equations for incompressible saturating phases have transferred into a system similar to the Buckley-Leverett equations of two-phase filtration, but written for a deformed porous medium. The zero-approximation poroelastic solutions are valuable as a class of non-one-dimensional approximations of motions of a porous material in a medium with constant volume. The zero- and first-approximation equations are enough to develop the fast numerical algorithm, for they can be used to estimate the areas of possible matrix destruction.|","small parameter decomposition, approximate models, multiphase, coupled geomechanical-filtration model"

With an estimated 17 TCF of reserves spread across multiple fault blocks, reservoir simulation models for the Leviathan field show that gas recoveries exceeding one TCF are possible from a single well location. Considering the huge cost to install deep water subsea sand controlled wells, the ability to reduce the total well count necessary to deplete the field is a business imperative. This study to evaluate the potential to maximize recovery from a single well completion was comprised of three areas of focus: 1. The well completion design that can deliver ultra-high gas rates (500 MMscfd) to maximize production rate and accelerate recovery from a fault block. 2. The erosion, corrosion, and equipment considerations to recover one TCF from a well. 3. A worldwide study of 78 analogous gas fields and their actual or predicted performance.

Post-yield mechanical behavior of granular materials is incorporated in the model to study the mechanical instabilities associated with such completions. Fluid flow calculations are also incorporated in which they are computationally coupled with the mechanical calculations to generate pore pressure and stress distribution in the sand matrix. In addition, the presented model extends the use of the sand erosion criterion developed by Kim (2010) in order to compute the mass of the produced sand. It has been shown through field experience that sanding is influenced by several factors such as completion geometry, wellbore inclination, perforation orientation, and in-situ stress anisotropy. The developed model is capable of simulating the impact of these factors and assessing their sanding risk through advanced modeling and meshing techniques. The model can be utilized accordingly to design a wellbore completion that maximizes the mechanical stability and reduces the sand production rate. Different production and operational conditions can also be simulated to determine the onset of sand production and the critical drawdown pressure. Results obtained from the model shows that vertical wellbores produce less sand sands in regions where the overburden stress is the maximum in-situ stress. In horizontal wellbores, vertically oriented perforations are more stable than horizontally oriented perforations and can withstand higher drawdown before sand is produced. A wellbore model with multiple perforations was also constructed to investigate the effect of mechanical and hydraulic interference from adjacent perforations on the evolution of plastic strain. It was shown that perforation spacing has an influence on both the magnitude the spatial spread of the plastified zone. By combining the effects of phasing angle, perforation density, and wellbore diameter, the presented model is capable of determining the completion configuration with the least sanding risk.  |","Perforation stability, Elasto-plastic modeling, Sand production"

The investigation and modeling efforts are carried out in several steps. First, the damage potential of shale formations containing large quantities of clay and nonclay inorganic, and organic materials, and natural fractures filled with cement and other debris is delineated. Second, the thermal, chemical, and stress interactions between the drilling and fracturing fluids of frequently used types are described. The various relevant processes and their fundamental mechanisms, including under/over balanced drilling, fracturing fluid disposition and retainment, wettability and nonequilibrium fluid transmission and spontaneous imbibition, swelling and fluidization, gas blockage occurring in extremely-low permeability shale porous media, are reviewed.

A geomechanics study of the reservoir sections of the abandoned wells examined the mechanical properties, including rock strength and plasticity, as well as the state of stress acting on the producing sections. The study predicted the sanding history of both wells accurately.  Modelling indicated that a thin sand layer with low rock strength was the main contributor to the overall sand production.  This was later validated with a Downhole Sand Detector Tool. The modeling also indicated that sand production was likely from other, stronger sections of the reservoir as the field continued to deplete Once a validated prediction of sand failure had been constructed for the reservoir, the study investigated improvements to the well design that would give both economic productions rates and sand-free production for the lifetime of the field. In addition to considering geomechanical properties, the study investigated the geometry of the completion to find the most stable orientations for the wellbore and the perforations. After an economic feasibility study, one of the abandoned wells was sidetracked along the optimally selected trajectory and perforated with oriented guns, isolating identified weak zones.  The field has been producing since this remedial work without any sand production and the missed production has been recovered.|","Perforation, Down Hole Validation, Geomechanics, Sand Management, Rock Mechanics"

With time the water saturation increased and water breakthrough is common in high permeability streaks causing the water cut to increase substantially. In these fields the challenge is to increase oil production and recoverable reserves through stimulation without increasing the water cut. For this reason until recently hydraulic fracturing was not considered a viable option. Conventional acid treatments while increasing oil production also increase the water cut, sometimes making the production uneconomical. To try and overcome this, acid treatment with diverter stages are used to selectively stimulate the oil saturated intervals or relative permeability modifiers are used to limit water production. However, this has not proved to be a reliable solution. To hydraulically fracture wet producers a linear fracturing fluid was introduced. The fluid comprised of low concentrations of a disproportionate permeability modifier and guar polymer creates a pseudo viscoelastic disproportionate permeability modifier (VDPM). The disproportionate permeability modifier reduces the effective permeability to water in the fracture faces, while the relatively low viscosity of the fluid limits the net pressure and the risk of fracture height growth, without comprising proppant transport. The viscosity and leakoff control of the fluid maybe adjusted as a function of the formation permeability and stress profile. The first hydraulic fracturing campaign of 12 wells using the VDPM fluid was in the Hollin formation, with a strong aquifer. The upper section produces oil while the lower section is water saturated, the distance between the two, 5 to 20 ft. On average the oil production increased 3 fold while the water cut decreased 15%. The VDPM fluid has now been used successful in more than 40 wells in different fields and formations, increasing production by more than 10,000 BOPD. While the results of matrix treatments with disproportionate permeability modifier in wet producers are notoriously mixed hydraulic fracturing with a VDPM fluid has proved a reliable means to selectively increase oil production. This has a very positive impact on the economics and reserves recovery in marginal fields.|","water control, Fracturing wet producers, Stimulation"

A redevelopment plan started in 2004 to revamp oil production under an Alliance partnership between an Oil & Gas Company Malysia and Schlumberger. The mentioned Brown field is a multilayered reservoir where the UCS can vary from 1500 psi in the consolidated sand until less than 800 psi in the shallow zones. Based on a geomechics study and existing production history of the field, unconsolidated producer sands were identified and sand control methods were evaluated according to the degree of achieving the goals, and reducing risk, the result indicates that the Cased Hole Gravel Pack with Alternate Path System was preferential. Additional information was obtained in the latest campaign during the retrieval of gravel pack screens in 2 sand producing wells, which gave a better understanding of the failure mechanism in the previous gravel pack operations. The main changes in the design of sand control systems during 8 years includes adopting a perforating strategy of performing a mechanical backsurge, increasing shot density and charges with low debris, use of a 3-way sub tailpipe system to avoid problems associated with breaking flapper valves and debris accumulation, number of cup packers, size of screens, slurry concentration and back pressure applied during the treatment. Furthermore the evolution in the sand control management have showed benefits such as increasing the number of gravel pack zones per well, performing longer gravel packs, installing permanent downhole gauges and using bigger tubing. This paper presents as case study of the evolution and the impact of the sand management systems, showing the significant changes in the design and execution of gravel packs and describing the reasons for those changes.

The testing suite includes friction reduction, capillary suction time, and shale strength changes after exposure to the fracturing fluid. The friction testing method was correlated to previously published work in larger diameter tubing and utilizes a small volume of water so that actual field water samples can be used. The capillary suction utilizes off-the-shelf equipment to give rapid determination of fluid and shale interactions. The shale strength change method involves dynamic exposure of share cores to the fracturing fluid at temperature, shear rates and times representative of the fracturing treatment. Shale strength changes are determined by measuring hardness of the core surface exposed to the fracturing fluid and comparing it to the opposite side of the core which was not exposed to fluids. The friction reduction test has been used with great success to rate the performance of friction reducers in various types of water, to determine optimum friction reducer concentration, and to determine the interaction of other common additives such as biocides or scale inhibitors with the friction reducers. The strength testing has shown significant strength reduction in some shales with certain types of fracturing fluids and little strength reduction when the fracturing fluid was changed. A variety of fracturing fluids have been tested from slickwater to gelled oil fluids to traditional crosslinked fluid. The strength reduction should be indicative of proppant embedment in the shale. The suite of tests proposed has been successfully used for multiple operators in order to determine interaction effects of fracturing fluids with shales as well as to optimize friction reducer performance.|","Friction, Fracturing, Shale, Strength"

The fluids enter the pore structure of the formation, and the presence of the invading phase blocks the in-situ phase. This event reduces permeability, particularly in unconventional reservoirs. Operators shut-in the well for an arbitrary time amount of time after fracturing to allow these phase blocks to dissipate. Conventional core flow tests and relative permeability evaluations using centrifuge drainage tests are unreliableif not impossiblein these ultralow-permeability rocks. In this paper, we present a method to measure the gas permeability on a core plug at reservoir conditions, both before and periodically after the plug was exposed to fracture fluid. The change in gas permeability over time allows optimization of the shut-in time. In addition, the combined rate of leak-off and imbibition is measured while the material is exposed to fluid. At the conclusion of the test, the axial water profile is determined by measuring unconfined compressive strength through by the mechanical scratch machine and water saturation with Karl Fisher titration. The measured dissipation time depends on the rock class as defined by Heterogeneous Rock Analysis which is based on the wireline log response. The samples initially are saturated with gas and have the highest permeability. As the plug is exposed to water the permeability drops below the detection limit of 1nD. The water is removed from the face of the plug, water block is allowed to dissipate by capillary forces, and increases the permeability to 60% of the original value. Experimental results on core plugs from two major shale plays show that imbibition and fluid loss into ultralow-permeability rock can be substantial, but these processes are also highly variable. We have developed a measure of the phase block dissipation that is related to the materials mineralogy, pore size distribution, and therefore, the log response. The information gives operators a quantitative measure to determine the length of shut-in periods and for the development of other methods to minimize the damage from water imbibition.|","permeability, water block, unconventional reservoirs, core analysis, pulse-decay"

Historically, severity of losses has been categorized based on the amount of barrels lost to the formation, i.e., seepage, partial, and total. Though helpful, this strategy doesnt help understand the underlying drive mechanism(s) for losses and doesnt provide enough data to propose a solution. The recently adopted category is focused on the lost-circulation mechanism based on the properties of the exposed formation; these classifications are losses to 1) pore throats, 2) induced or natural fractures, and 3) vugs or caverns. This study provides an integrated workflow to predict expected losses for such classification/mechanism of losses. Mud loss through fracturing is categorized based on fracture types, i.e., natural or induced fractures. Different models are used with respect to the fluid-loss mechanism in natural and induced fractures. These models take into account the effect of fracture breathing. In addition, mud loss through the pores on the wellbore and the fracture face is modeled based on formation and mud-cake filtration properties, coupled with the fracture losses. Losses to vugs/caverns are usually total losses due to very large openings in the rock; recommendations are provided on how to control severe losses. Lost circulation not only causes the adverse effect of mud loss itself; it can also lead to several other issues, such as formation damage, stuck pipe, hole collapse, and well-control incidents.The current industry trend is moving towards drilling more low-pressure zones, and lost-circulation planning is becoming a vital part of these projects. Knowledge of the type and the expected amount of mud loss can help engineers select the most appropriate and effective solution and preplan accordingly. This information also provides criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied lost-circulation strategy. In this study we review LCM treatments, wellbore strengthening, MPD, and CwD as some of the most common remedial techniques.  |","Lost Circulation, Formation Damage, managed pressure drilling, induced fractures, casing while drilling"

In these reservoirs, pressure maintenance and sweep efficiency are achieved by injection of desulfated sea water mixed with an increasing proportion of produced water reinjection. This reservoir management policy perfectly fits with Totals commitment to reduce discharges to the environment during its operations. However, Produced Water Re-Injection (PWRI) comes with its own challenges, mainly because of well injectivity impairment linked to the presence of oil and solids in the injected water which is not the case when only desulfated sea water is injected. Water treatment facilities are designed to meet water discharge specifications in terms of oil in water content and to remove some solids. Yet it is difficult to accurately monitor the concentrations of solids present in the injected water at surface and when it reaches the reservoir wellbore interface of the injection wells. In this context, reservoir management (and more precisely voidage replacement management) strongly depends on the ability to monitor, analyze and manage the injectivities of wells. The objective of the present work is to describe the methods used to set injectivity index references and follow their evolution in time. Several months or years of operational data then provide an insight into the injectivity decline and enhancement mechanisms at hand. Different injectivity decline models (function of instantaneous proportion of produced water in the injected water or function of cumulative injected volumes of produced water) and an injectivity enhancement model (function of plastic shear strains around the injector wells) are also presented, discussed and compared to field data. In addition, methods for improving or restoring injectivity (injection of sea water batches or chemical products) are illustrated.

Previous simulation studies investigated the effects of well spacing and fracture length on well productivity in low-permeability oil and gas reservoirs. It was shown that the most important parameters for determining the optimum fracture length are the formation permeability and the stimulated reservoir volume. Although a number of studies have examined the performance of horizontal fractured wells and fracture geometry effect, fracture spacing and intersecting angles in vertical and horizontal wells should be further investigated. This study presents the results of a tight oil reservoir in the Bakken shale. Reservoir parameters considered include local rock stresses, rock compressibility, absolute and relative permeability, and porosity. The well-completion parameters included fracture length, height, width, conductivity, number and spacing between fractures, fracture intersecting angle, and cased vs. open-hole completion. Fracture modeling considered rigorous description of the hydraulic fracture properties and finite difference reservoir modeling. Economically attractive reserves recovery were modeled through multiple fracture placements in a 10,000 ft horizontal well. Numerical simulation showed that oil recovery increased between 8 to 15% while net present value (NPV) increased 8 to 24%, as the number of fractures increased. Based on the critical assumptions in the study (permeability, natural fracture distribution and stress orientation), an optimum number of fractures was identified. Open hole completions provided better performance in most cases, and recovery was greater for a higher number of contributing perpendicular vs. longitudinal fractures. The results of the study may hopefully be used to improve the understanding of the role of fracture geometry, spacing and open/cased-hole completion strategy to enhance operators optimum completion design.|","multiple fracture completion, low permeability, fracture spacing, tight oil, integrated asset model"

Accelerating the optimization, reducing capital expenditures, and improving lifecycle NPV for the asset is a very attractive goal. Seven shale properties are key drivers to successful play economics. However the heterogeneity of shales makes well location selection difficult without appraisal well logs and geostatistical mapping of shale property quality. The analysis method lets an operator quickly high-grade areas within a large, heterogeneous shale play using logging suites from a limited number of wellbores in the play. Further, the methodology has been extended to quantify the plays potential reward vs. risk distribution for in-fill drilling investments. This study extends the method to optimizing lateral lengths of horizontal wells. Geostatistics provides a means to determine correlation lengths of aggregate shale properties known to be critical to successful economics. The correlation length is used to determine the appropriate length of the horizontal well lateral, restricting it within the highest rock quality for stimulation effectiveness and production rates. Since optimal lateral lengths can be predicted using this approach, it is now possible to pinpoint the best wellhead location, the best landing point for the horizontal portion of the well, and set the optimal length of the lateral. This reduces the drilling of unproductive lateral lengths and targets stimulations. By shortening the trial and error evaluation lifecycle stage using this methodology, an operator can develop an asset more quickly and at less cost than with previous approaches.|","Sweet Spot, Horizontal Wells, Optimization, Shale, Geostatistics"

But shale is often used as a catch-all term including different rocks with a non-negligible clay minerals content which leads to typical physical-chemical characteristics. Several properties are generally assessed for shale gas plays (TOC, porosity,). However, regarding the access to the reservoir, drilling into the formations implies a good knowledge of their mechanical and petrographic properties. As classical cores are quite difficult to collect from deep wells, unconventional techniques using small samples are useful (Tshibangu et al. 1999). When dealing with hydraulic fracturing, the formation brittleness is to be assessed. Several estimators exist (Yagiz 2009), among which we propose the so named plasticity index determined from punching tests. The Faculty of Engineering Mons (Belgium) and Halliburton have been collaborating for more than fifteen years ; samples coming from all over the World and associated with difficult drilling conditions have been collected and processed in the laboratory. This work involved thin section characterization and mechanical tests like FPMs abrasivity, Shore hardness and punching tests. Recently, a database was then built in order to analyze the cumulated information (Descamps et al. 2013). In the context of gas shales, this database includes several fine grained rocks. Indeed, part of the database is specifically dedicated to shales, claystones and siltstones but, if we also consider other fine grained rocks (i.e. grain or crystal size below 125 microns) more than 120 samples have been processed. In this paper, two main axes are developed. First, we describe typical properties of fine grained rocks, especially when they are associated to difficult drilling environments. Then, we look to how those properties can be linked together. Particular interest will be taken on abrasivity regarding the selection of drilling bits and on brittleness assessment in relation to hydraulic fracturing.|","fine-grained rocks, rock properties, hydraulic fracturing, drilling, small samples"

Most of the tight gas reservoirs presently being developed are sandstone formations, although carbonate rocks can also be tight-gas producers. The standard industry definition for a tight-gas reservoir is a rock with matrix porosity of 10% or less and permeability of 0.1 millidarcy or less, exclusive of natural fracture permeability. Unconventional gas resources, including tight sands, constitute some of the largest components of remaining natural gas resources in the Middle East and North Africa. Developing unconventional and tight gas reservoirs will allow Saudi Arabia to better meet rising domestic energy needs. During the past decade, conventional formations were stimulated successfully in Saudi Arabia with conventional completion techniques. However, as the development of existing fields continues into deeper formations and the exploration of new reservoirs are mainly toward unconventional reservoirs, new challenges are now faced, especially considering that lower permeabilities, higher stresses, and higher temperatures are experienced. This means an evaluation of the current techniques are necessarily in order to overcome the challenges in these extreme conditions.

It is also well known that large areas in the Neuquen basin are under strike slip stress conditions which may have a strong influence on stimulation effectiveness.

Deep reservoir targets (below 4000 m), active tectonics and simultaneous occurrence of heterogeneous rock properties (including isotropic and anisotropic behavior) constitute a unique endeavor for a correct geomechanical modeling and a reliable assessment of closure pressures and fracture containment as input for hydraulic fracturing design. This paper describes the implementation of an integrated unconventional evaluation workflow adopted for the completion design and hydraulic fracturing of a vertical well in tight sands and gas shales in Tunisia. A data acquisition program tailored for tight formations was implemented to ensure full integration of logs data and core data from laboratory testing. Anisotropic measurements from borehole sonic data using Sonic Scanner logging and laboratory geomechanical tests were used to characterize the mechanical behavior of the reservoir lithological units, showing high degree of mechanical anisotropy in Silurian shales and Ordovician clayey horizons. Since isotropic assumptions predict inaccurate stress magnitudes and lead to significant error in stress contrast, the use of anisotropic-based geomechanical modeling is emphasized with regard to wellbore stability analysis and completion design. The integrated workflow involving anisotropic stress modeling allowed addressing and solving open issues related to wellbore failure prediction and estimation of hydraulic fracture containment. For completion design purpose a comparison between of different assumptions in terms of geomechanical input and hydraulic fracturing stimulation outputs is presented. The influence of the two different stress models (i.e. isotropic and anisotropic) is discussed. The effect on fracture geometry of the anisotropic clay layers commonly treated as purely isotropic is emphasized. It is shown that because the higher minimum horizontal stress predicted by the anisotropic model in the shales intervals the hydraulic fracture in tight sands stays more contained in the reservoir target providing a better reservoir contact and optimum completion.|","geomechanics, anisotropy, Unconventional, shales, fracturing"

By undertaking a vertical well pilot logging program the acreage was logged for petrophysical and geomechanical properties using advanced geo-chemical and full-wave sonic tools to quantify reservoir quality (RQ) and completion quality (CQ), respectively. Detailed fracture simulations were performed at multiple depths to locate the optimum landing point that maximized reservoir contact. Incorporating the key findings of the wellbore stability analysis, the well was geosteered using a rotary steerable system and a logging-while drilling (LWD) resistivity tool that placed 100% of the lateral in the target zone. Further completion simulations were performed to determine a perforating and staging strategy which would optimize the number of stages. The flow-channel fracturing technique, which provides a novel approach for achieving fracture conductivity, was also implemented on the studied well to significantly improve the effectiveness of the fracture stimulation treatment. Fracture diagnostics, detailed post fracture modeling, and production analysis techniques, which utilized rate-transient analysis and history matching, were performed to provide better understanding of the effectiveness of the stimulation treatments (fracture lengths/conductivity), thereby allowing for further optimization of the stimulation program.

Microseismic monitoring is the most powerful tool to help us understand where and what is happening during and after the stimulation. Yet very little is understood about the relationship between microseismicity and hydraulic fractures: some believe microseismic events are part of the hydraulic fractures, some believe they are resulting from stress changes and fluid leak-off. Microseismic datasets with accurate event locations complemented with source mechanisms lead us to a new level of understanding of the interaction between hydraulic fracturing and seismic response. There are at least four geomechanical models to explain observed failure mechanisms and the opening (or closing) of hydraulic fractures (seismic tensile opening, leak-off cloud of seismicity around the hydraulic fracture, shearing between aseismic tensile opening and horizontal fractures shearing on vertical planes). Unfortunately none of these models is consistent with observations presented in this study. Hence we developed a new geomechanical model of bedding plane slippage induced by hydraulic fractures in shale reservoirs. We present a case study including detailed source mechanism inversion for a microseismic dataset from hydraulic fracturing of a shale gas play in the North America. We observe source mechanisms dominated by shear failure with dip-slip and strike-slip sense of motion. The dip-slip mechanisms are prevailing oriented with shear planes along the maximum horizontal stress. This can be explained as slippage on beddings planes caused by aseismic opening of hydraulic fractures. This model explains large energy difference between seismic and hydraulic energy, and prevailing orientation of the shear planes of the microseismic events. In addition, the bedding planes are weak planes in the shale formation likely to fail. The model can better constrain fundamental parameters of induced hydraulic fractures and describe hydraulic fractures and their interaction with the shale plays.|","Stimulation, Source mechanisms, Microseismic, Hydraulic Fracturing, Interpretation"

However, studies of production logs in the Barnett Shale (SPE 144326), the Marcellus Shale and the Eagle Ford Shale have shown that a significant percentage of perforations clusters are not producing quantifiable amounts of fluid or gas. Case studies designed to address this have shown that addressing the heterogeneity experienced around the wellbore (SPE 155485) in combination with more focus on landing and staying in the best quality reservoir rock (SPE 138427) lead to more productive wells with a higher degree of perforation performance. The challenge faced by many operators is incorporating a completion optimization workflow into their completions that is both technically effective and cost effective. The desired completion system is one that incorporates as much information as needed for successful completion while being operationally unobtrusive. Refined techniques used to convey dipole sonic tools in cased laterals have been supplemented by a new generation of easily deployed tools capable of making density, neutron, resistivity, and sonic measurements in open hole. This gives operators a wide array of options that can fit into a completion optimization program. This paper reviews the concept of optimized plug and perf completions as compared to the more frequently used approach of geometrically spacing stages and perforations. Reservoir quality and completion quality variables are discussed along with different types of data that can be easily acquired with cost effective methods and how those data can be used in completion optimization. Finally, a work flow that is repeatable, portable, and effective is introduced that can be applied to any rock type where variation in petrophysical or mechanical properties along lateral wells are expected.|","logging, completion, shale, optimization, unconventional"

One of the key parameters for ensuring successful stimulation and prolonged production is the right selection of stimulation fluid. The selection and optimization of the fracturing fluid is greatly dependent on the reservoir rock properties as well as the formation softening due to fluid-formation interaction. A slick water treatment fluid has often been adopted in tight shale plays in the past for creating a complex fracture network for maximum production yield. Most often the slick water recipe is driven by formation fluid sensitivity analysis, e.g., effect of fresh water, salt or acids on formation. While this may work for some formations, the rock mechanical properties such as Youngs Modulus and Poissons ratio will determine the fraccability and whether it is advantageous to use a slick water, linear gel, or crosslinked gel. Similarly, analysis of formation softening with Brinell hardness testing and proppant embedment testing will help ensure that the formation does not close upon treatment completion and will have conductive flow channels. This paper discusses the impact of different types of fracturing fluids on different shale formations. The paper also describes test processes involving fluid sensitivity tests, formation softening, and rock mechanical tests and compares data from a few representative shales to show the impact of choosing the right fluid formulation for hydraulic fracturing. The formation rock, proppant, and fracturing fluid interaction may also result in diagenetic growth on proppant and formation faces resulting in formation softening and large decrease in fracture conductivity. The paper focusses on careful optimization of the stimulation fluid based on rock parameters to ensure prolonged production in tight oil and gas shale plays.|","Rock Mechanics, Formation Softening, Shale Stimulation Fluid"

A., Schlumberger| Cavazzoli, G., Schlumberger| Velez, E. I., Schlumberger| Peano, J., Tecpetrol","|In the Vaca Muerta shale located in the Neuquen basin, Argentina, the most prolific intervals tends to be the most difficult to hydraulically fracture due to the abnormally high fracture gradients present in some parts of the basin. Thus it becomes very important to have a good understanding of the anisotropic geomechanical properties of this heterogeneous formation prior to developing the completion strategy. This paper presents a case history where a calibrated, anisotropic 1D mechanical earth model (1D MEM) was developed and used in developing an optimized completion strategy for a vertical well in the Vaca Muerta shale. The output from the 1D MEM including the principal stresses, anisotropic elastic properties, pore pressure and rock strength, were used to define the reservoir intervals with best characteristics for initiation, propagation and maintenance of a conductive complex fracture network. Next, the reservoir intervals with the highest hydrocarbon generation tendency were determined from petrophysical and image logs acquired on the well. This formed the basis for selecting the optimum number of stages and perforation strategy on the well. Sensitivity analysis revealed the impact of the hydraulic fracture properties on the production performance, e.g. higher fracture conductivity greatly improves the well performance in the deeper Vaca Muerta intervals, while larger fracture surface area is more beneficial across the shallower intervals. Thus, a unique completion strategy was developed for each interval to optimize the well performance. Three hydraulic fracture stages were eventually planned, but due to casing limitation, only the first stage was eventually executed. A time-lapse acoustic measurement acquired on the well corroborated the propped fracture height predicted during the completion design phase. This example illustrates how proper characterization of the anisotropic geomechanical behavior of the Vaca Muerta formation improves the development of a completion strategy which ultimately optimizes economic performance of the well.|","Vaca Muerta, Shale, Completion Optimization, Geomechanics, Anisotropic Stress"

The proposed graded proppant injection technology can be used for productivity enhancement of coal seam gas wells and other unconventional resources, for i.e., shales, tight gas and geothermal reservoirs. A mathematical model was derived to describe proppant particle trajectory and optimum proppant placement in order to increase productivity/injectivity indexes. Computational fluid dynamics has been used to determine the hydraulic resistance due to proppant plugging of the fractured system. The model can predict proppant particle trajectory in naturally fractured system based on a force balance involving gravity, Stokes and Saffman lifting forces. The trajectory is calculated by exact solution of ordinary differential equations. An optimal injection schedule, i.e., the timely dependence of the injected proppant size, density and concentration, has been developed in order to avoid fracture closure during production stage and also to provide minimum hydraulic resistance in the system of fractures plugged by the proppant particles. The analytical model shows that the productivity/injectivity indexes are very sensitive to the injection schedule, initial fracture aperture and permeability.

In the tests to find mechanical qualities, we mostly limit the tests to static or steady state conditions; for example, Youngs moduli and Poissons ratio measurements, compressive strengths, tensile strengths, anything that offers well understood and useful data. This paper discusses the creation of a new test process, where time is one aspect of the rock mechanics science in the oil field.

The proposed technology can be used for productivity enhancement of gas wells in other unconventional resources, i.e., shales and tight gas reservoirs. Graded injection of proppant particles with increasing size and decreasing concentration results in deep percolation of proppant into the natural fracture system, expansion of the stimulated zone and enhancement of well productivity index. A mathematical model for well indexes during graded particle injection accounting for stress changes in coal beds is developed. The model is based on analytical solution for quasi 1d problem with the aid of a couple of axisymmetric fluid flow and geomechanics. The results of previous computational fluid dynamic studies have been used to determine hydraulic resistance due to proppant plugging of the fractured system. Some experimental tests conducted on a coal core plug in order to validate the results of our model with lab tests. During Lab tests, by decreasing effective stress, permeability increased by 7 times at minimum effective stress then graded extra fine/high strength proppant particles injected in to the core fracture network at minimum effective stress. It was observed that by increasing effective stress to the primary effective stress, permeability of fracture network improved by two times compared to original permeability. In modelling part, by applying the effect of proppant concentration and fracture deformation, a critical stimulation radius is introduced beyond which proppant placement decreases the permeability; therefore, this critical stimulation radius is the maximum radius which is needed for proppant placement in order to have the highest productivity index. The model has been applied for a real field case and the effect of injection pressure on well productivity index and stimulation radius is presented. The result shows significant increases in productivity index by applying this technology.|","Ultra-fine particle injection, Coal bed methane, natural fracture system, experimental study, mathematical modelling"

This paper describes a new robust workflow that uses a reservoir simulator and a new reservoir property called the Shale Capacity to estimate the actual SRV and the subsequent reserves resulting from the interaction between the fracing and the response of the reservoir. The actual SRV seems to be related mostly to the Shale Capacity defined as the product of four key shale drivers: Total Organic Content, Porosity, Brittleness, and Natural Fracture Density. When producing a shale reservoir, it appears that the Relative Intercepted Shale Capacity (RISC), seems to have a strong correlation with the resulting actual SRV. Application: Actual SRV in shale reservoirs could be estimated with reasonable accuracy if the 3D shale capacity model is used in a reservoir simulator to reproduce the well performance. Additionally, the microseismic could be used to validate the derived actual SRV which is a subset of the microseismic SRV.. Results, Observations, and Conclusions: These concepts are illustrated with a Marcellus example where the actual SRV was estimated using the shale capacity and microseismic events validated the areas where the well is actually draining from.

Field experiences indicate that such shut-in episodes may improve well productivity significantly while reducing water production. Aided by laboratory relative-permeability and capillary-pressure data, and their hysteresis in a shale-gas reservoir, a flow-simulation model was able to reproduce the suspected water-blocking behavior. Results demonstrate that a well resting period improves early productivity while reducing water production.Results, Observation, and Conclusions During hydraulic fracturing, water wets the fracture surfaces and begins to invade parts of the formation under the influence of imbibition-capillary pressure, thereby creating a zone of high-water saturation around the fracture faces. Well shut-in permits the imbibition process to evolve, allowing the water to move deeper into the formation resulting in a lower water saturation and corresponding higher gas relative permeability near the fracture surface. Eventually, the water block dissipates and allows the gas to flow from matrix into the propped fractures. The reduced gas flow is a manifestation of temporary blockage, leading to a small apparent stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) when field data are analyzed with rate-transient analysis. However, the trapped water appears to be in transition in that it does not impact long-term production performance. Because water trapping may significantly reduce early gas production, water should be flowed back as early as possible.Technical Significance1. Relative permeability, capillary pressure and hysteresis data are critical for modeling shut-in time and flowback. 2. Guidelines for well shut-in and water flowback have been developed following history matching a field response with a high-resolution, numerical flow-simulation model. 3. The early-time production data are unsuitable for rate-transient analysis because water blockage leads to an artificially reduced SRV. 4.

Only a fraction of the large water volume used in fracturing treatments is recovered during the flowback operations. The fate of non-recovered water and its impact on early-time and late-time hydrocarbon production are poorly understood. This paper aims at understanding the relationship between water recovery and rock petrophysical properties measured downhole by logging tools or in the lab by XRD and Rock Eval techniques. It also investigates the relationship between the soaking time (shut-in time) and water recovery. First, we conduct extensive spontaneous imbibition experiments on downhole samples from several Canadian shale plays. The samples are characterized by measuring porosity, mineralogy, and TOC, and by interpreting the well logs. We also develop an analytical approach to upscale the lab data, and predict the water imbibition volume when the well is shut-in after the fracturing operation. Second, we analyze the volume and chemistry of water measured in the field during several flowback operations. The lab data suggests that the water up-take of organic shales depends on clay content, initial water saturation, and TOC. The up-scaling results suggest that up to 25 % of injected frac water can be spontaneously imbibed into the clay-rich gas shales after one month of soaking time. In general, the imbibed volume is proportional to the square root of time and fracture-matrix interface. The variations observed in water recovery in the field can be successfully explained by the imbibition data measured in the lab. The results of this study demonstrate the important role that imbibition plays during the soaking time as a mechanism controlling water production after the fracturing operations. This phenomenon can be optimized by controlling the fracturing water formulation and more importantly the soaking time.|","Fracturing Water Recovery, Flowback Operation, Water Imbibition, Hydraulic Fracturing, Shale Gas"

This study presents the heterogeneity exposed in a large quarry near Osnabrueck, Germany, which contains faulted and jointed third-order coarse- to fine-grained tight sandstone cycles separated by anthracite coal seams. First, we characterize the rocks and the lateral variation of rock properties such as porosity, diagenesis and structural inventory. Than we test whether the quarry may act as a reservoir analog to better constrain input data for reservoir modelling. The tight sandstones are intensely compacted and cemented with quartz and generally characterized by low matrix porosities < 8 % (He-pycnometry on plugs and cuttings) and very low permeabilities (<0.01 mD). Porosity is generally secondary, formed by detrital and authigenic carbonate dissolution and dissolution of feldspars. Matrix porosity significantly increases up to 25% in corridors around faults. Rock types can be distinguished by spectral gamma ray in the quarry. Fluid flow within and around faults is indicated by quartz veins and fault mineralizations. Normal faults show and bands of clay smear and gouge, forming compartments. Fractures were analyzed in a 50 x 50 m section of the quarry wall using Lidar laser scanning. This digitized quarry face also allows the characterization of the lithology and quantitative measurement of bedding, fracture and fault orientation data in inaccessible areas.

However, understanding and technologies needed for an effective development of unconventional reservoirs are far behind the industry needs. Compared to conventional reservoirs, gas production in ultra-low-permeability unconventional reservoirs is driven by highly non-linear flow equations and involves many coexisting processes due to the presence of multi-scale fracture networks, and to the heterogeneous nature of a porous/fractured and stress-sensitive rock. Therefore, quantifying flow in unconventional gas reservoirs remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we discuss a mathematical model and a numerical approach for simulating the production of unconventional gas reservoirs, in order to assess well performance and understand the critical parameters that affect gas recovery. Specifically, we consider the flow behavior in a stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) including a tight matrix and multi-scale fracture networks, namely primary hydraulic fractures, induced secondary fractures and micro-fractures. The feasibility and the limits in the use of single-porosity or dual-porosity reservoir models to simulate gas flow in such a system are discussed, and a multi-porosity approach is evaluated. The impacts of various physics related to unconventional gas reservoirs, such as adsorption/desorption, Klinkenberg and geomechanical effects, are quantified. This work helps to improve simulation technologies for low-permeability unconventional gas reservoirs. An appropriate modeling approach actually underlies effective simulation tools for quantitative studies of unconventional reservoir dynamics and performance, taking into account multi-scale fracture impacts on gas production, well and stimulation design, and optimal production schedules in field development.|","mathematical and physical model, reservoir simulation, shale gas, unconventional reservoir, numerical method"

A stimulation technique called zipper fracturing was planned and performed in these wells to create a high-density system of low-complexity planar fractures between laterals with the objective to maximize the contact area with the reservoir and therefore the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). The wells were drilled perpendicular to the expected fracture azimuth in the objective Pechi-B formation and completed as openhole laterals using a ball-and-sleeve completion strategy. Thirty-two fracturing stages (16 fractures per well) were selected based on an integral analysis of geological, petrophysical, and geomechanical disciplines. This zipper frac technique using a ball-and-sleeve completion was the first stimulation treatment of its kind in Mexico. The zipper frac technique fractures adjacent wells in sequence, enabling one well to hold fracture pressure while the adjacent well is being fractured. The fractures then avoid each other because of the stress pattern set up in the pressured well. The zipper frac technique also maximizes the exposure of new reservoir rock. The two adjacent horizontal wells were successfully stimulated in 108 hours of continuous work, pumping 95,000 bbl of fracturing fluid and 8.6 million pounds of ceramic proppant. The stimulation technique reduced stimulation cycle time to just four days, and the initial production of the two wells was more than 8,320 bbl/day, which was more than ten times the average initial production in the area, becoming stable at 2,517 and 1,011 BOPD, respectively.

An operator in the Vienna Basin is currently increasing operational efficiency saving two days per well by implementing DwC methods in the surface intervals in the wells basis of design. Using this technology, they have been able to drill approximately 10% more wells in the allotted time frame enabling earlier recovery of oil and gas versus using conventional drilling methods.

Drilling deviated wells through shale has always been a challenge,drilling long laterals in shale becomes even more challenging. Most organic rich shale layers (target zones) are overlain by thick high clay mudstone formations. These formations have thinly bedded laminated structures resulting in anisotropic rock strength. A well drilled perpendicular to laminations is not affected, however, when drilled at an oblique angle, it is exposed to planes of weakness causing severe instabilities, necessitating either a sidetrack or loss circulation due to drilling induces fractures. Operators have lost a number of BHAs or attempted several sidetracks in shale gas exploratory wells because of these instabilities. Since the shale gas exploration start-up for the operator commenced with simultaneous drilling of horizontal and vertical wells, it posed a tremendous drilling challenge due to lack of any prior shale gas drilling experience in the region.

This paper describes a new numerical modeling approach called the Material Point Method (MPM) that overcomes the limitation of the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) commonly used to model the propagation of one single hydraulic fracture. Since MPM is a meshless method, it provides multiple unique advantages including the ability to simulate the propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures while accounting for their interaction with the natural fractures. In this work, the 3D distribution of the natural fractures system is derived from an accurate description that relies on the integrated use of seismic and well data. Application: An actual frac job is simulated around a horizontal wellbore where the surrounding reservoir rock has heterogeneous elastic properties derived from a pre-stack elastic inversion.

The processed results were used to conduct a multi-disciplinary study integrating geology, geomechanics, reservoir and completion engineering, and ultimately, production data. A stress inversion from focal mechanisms was performed, and correlations were made between hydrocarbon production and microseismic results. That work, in conjunction with the variability in the stimulation approach, was used to optimize the treatment design on an individual wellbore and on a field development scale. Incorporating information from source mechanisms, an event magnitude calibrated discrete fracture network (DFN) was designed taking into account the seismic energy of the events, rock properties, the injected fluid volume as well as fluid efficiency.

It is currently being investigated using a variety of techniques including the analysis of transient experiments conducted on full core and crushed shale using a range of gases. A range of gas flow mechanisms may operate including continuum flow, slippage, transitional flow and Knudsen diffusion. These processes as well as gas sorption need to be taken into account when interpreting experimental data and extrapolating the results to the subsurface. A finite volume method is developed in this paper to mathematically model gas flow in shale. The finite volume method combines the efficiency/simplicity of finite difference methods with the geometric flexibility of the finite element approach. The model is applicable to non-linear diffusion problems, in which the permeability and fluid density both depend on the scalar variable, pressure. The governing equation incorporates the Knudsen number, allowing different flow mechanisms to be addressed, as well as the gas adsorption isotherm. The method is validated for unsteady-state problems for which analytical or numerical solutions are available. The method is then applied for solving a pressure-pulse decay test and a comparison with an alternative finite-difference numerical solution is made. An inverse numerical formulation is generated, using a minimisation iterative algorithm, to estimate different number of unknown parameters. Both numerically simulated noisy and experimental data are input into the formulation of the inverse problem. Error analysis is undertaken to investigate the accuracy of results. A good agreement between inverted and exact parameter values is obtained. Results for inversions done for practical laboratory pressure-pulse decay tests of samples with very low permeability are also presented.|","Gas Flow, Shale, Permeability, Finite Volume Method, Inverse Problem"

J., University of Manchester","|Unconventional well completion and production: Geomechanics This study explores the link between lab-measured mechanical properties and sedimentological, diagenetic and burial histories of shales. Here attention is paid to the effects of microstructure on matrix permeability. Samples of Jurassic Whitby Mudstone comprise silt-bearing clay-rich shales with 6-9% porosity and <5% TOC. They exhibit a planar microfabric identified as elongate clay rich lenses and oriented mica grains. Unconfined acoustic velocities and permeability measurements attest to this transverse isotropy. Permeability was measured as a function of effective pressure (Peff) for flow of argon using the oscillating pore pressure method. Pressure cycling between Peff 10-70MPa was repeated on each sample until a reproducible pattern of permeability variation was observed. Pressure cycling initially reduced the permeability by 2-3 orders of magnitude, where it stabilised at ~10-18 m2 (at Peff 10 MPa). After cycling, permeability (k) of core plugs parallel to the foliation varies with Peff according to log10(k) = -0.94 * log10(Peff) -17.1. Over this pressure range pore closure is purely elastic and there is no permanent pore collapse. Results show that a meaningful description of the permeability can only be obtained after several pressure cycles have been applied, to recompact the rock to its state at depth. Removal of shale from depth inevitably results in some degree of volumetric expansion and consequent increase in permeability. After recompaction, variation of permeability with Peff is reproducible and can be used to model the reduction in gas flow to be expected as a result of the increased Peff that results from in-situ pore pressure decay during gas extraction. Such insight will improve the calculation of in-situ effective stresses and their effect on permeability, and is thus integral to optimising models of reservoir depletion.|","permeability, effective pressure, Shale gas, anisotropy"

Presently, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing strategies are often used in order to maximize the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). The current analysis Methodology is based on successively chaining the stimulation stages' results one to the other. At each stage, the 3D SRV is constructed based on its microseismic events by an enhanced convex hull approach. This algorithm offers both mathematical approximation of 3D volume and a 3D visualization of the SRVs geophysical shape. More detailed geometric characteristics are further calculated from the constructed SRVs best fitted ellipsoid, which relies on the acquired microseismic events. The major extracted characteristics are the length, width, height and orientations azimuth of the stimulated rock. Moreover, it forms the basis for calculating the overall SRV using the stage-by-stage approach. In the multi-stage advanced phase, this algorithm offers characteristics related to the interaction between multiple stages. The accurate 3D geophysical geometry of the overlapping volume between multiple stages is extracted and is calculated, and the percentage of overlapping volume over the SRV is estimated at each stage. These volume overlapping quantities reveal the potential reservoirs communication between these stages, indicating the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing efforts and implying the loss of treatment fluid. This algorithm provides the well operators with several useful aspects: an essential, reliable and direct compound tool to dynamically visualize the stimulated reservoir geometry and treatment field evolution; a real-time evaluation of the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing treatment; and parameters to help increase the production of stimulated reservoir.|","Ellipsoid Volume, Microseismic Events, SRV"

Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors have demonstrated the viability and cost-effectiveness of near-real-time monitoring of the regional ice conditions.

Reservoir simulation and prediction of production associated with hydraulic fracturing requires the input of the fracture geometry and the fracture properties such as the porosity and retained permeability. Various methods have been suggested and applied for deriving discrete fracture networks (DFN) from microseismic data as a framework for modeling reservoir performance. Although microseismic data is the best diagnostic for revealing the volume of rock fractured, its incompleteness in representing the deformation induced presents a challenge to calibrate and represent complex fracture networks created and connected during hydraulic fracture stimulation. We present an automated method to generate DFN models constrained by the microseismic locations and fracture plane orientations derived from moment tensor analysis. We use a Hough transform technique to find significant planar features from combinations of the microseismic source locations. We have modified the technique by using an equal-probability voting scheme to remove an inherent bias for horizontal planes. The voting mechanism is a general grid search in the space of fracture strike, dip and location (, respectively) with grid cell sizes scaled by uncertainty estimates of  We constrain fracture orientations with weighting based on the moment-tensor orientations of neighboring events and their associated uncertainties. Using two case studies, we demonstrate that our automated technique can reliably extract the complex fracture network based on good matches with the event cloud trends and the input moment tensor orientations.

With increasing location uncertainty, the details of the fracture network extracted are diminished with events grouping to larger scale features, but the general shape and orientation of the fracture network obtained is insensitive to the location uncertainty.|","Moment tensor,  Discrete fracture network, Microseismic monitoring"

The development of many shale plays has been met with significant challenges, including low production rates and rapid production declines, and many ideas and concepts have been tried to address these. Multi-well completions, like Simul-fracs and Zipper fracs for example, have been attempted as a means to increase production, but these have met with only limited success. 
The authors have shown in previous work that multi-well completions increase the in-situ stress field around the created hydraulic fractures, which has the effect of stabilizing natural fractures and weakness planes (making them more resistant to shear). Further, the authors have also shown in previous work that the increase in shear from the tip of propagating hydraulic fractures, in a Zipper frac multi-well completion for example, is a complicated factor of well spacing, frac spacing, hydraulic fracture length (for a given well spacing), natural fracture mechanical properties, and in-situ stress. 
In this paper, we present the results of a discrete element model numerical study of multi-well completions simulated in a fully hydro-mechanical coupled fashion. Building upon the previous work of the authors and others, the influence of changes in the in-situ pressure are considered in order to more completely understand the mechanical interactions between propagating hydraulic fractures and natural fractures during multi-well completions. The study includes a parametric study of well configuration, in-situ stress conditions, in-situ pressure, and mechanical properties on the ability to enhance natural fracture shear from multi-well completions and increase hydrocarbon production. 
The quantitative results of the study provide a direct means to consider when multi-well completions may help increase hydrocarbon production. Further, the results of the study also provide a means to optimize the application and design of multi-well completions as a function of the in-situ stresses, in-situ pressure, the mechanical properties of the natural fractures and weakness planes, and well configuration, which, ultimately, should lead to improved well economics. |","Multi-well Completions,  Simultaneous Fracturing, Hydraulic Fracturing,  Stimulation Optimization"

The most accessible product of microseismic monitoring during hydraulic fracturing is the 3-dimensional seismic cloud around the wellbore.  To realize the benefit of microseismic monitoring, we must quantify the data seismologically, spatially, and spatio-temporally, and compare this with pumping data and energy input/output to/from the system.  Our goal is to quantify meaningful correlations between the fractal dimensions b (frequency-magnitude; <1 = compression, 1 = shear, >1 = tension) and D (spatial clustering; 0 = point, 1 = line, 2 = plane, 3 = cloud), calculated from microseismic data collected in the Marcellus Shale of Southwestern Pennsylvania.  Limitations are related to the sensitivity and geometry of the acquisition system which affects microseism coordinates (and any calculated distances), magnitudes, signal/noise ratios, and energy arrivals.  
We illustrate the evolution of b and D as a function of time through four stages, with between 328 and 1048 events per stage.  In addition we compute the hydraulic diffusivity triggering front for each stage using time-distance plots and diffusivity contouring, the cumulative seismic energy and the s and p-wave energy components for each of the five stages.  Plotting b, D, and diffusivity values as well as pumping pressure, slurry rate, proppant concentration, and seismic energy release against time will shed light on the complex down-hole interactions between fluid and rock that create and propagate fractures.  In all stages, we see correlation between the b and D-values, but it is not consistently positive or negative throughout any stage.  Changes in the correlation are accompanied by a change in pumping pressure, rate, and the frequency of microseismic events.  An intriguing observation is a correlation between abrupt increases in total s-wave energy and decreasing b-value.  
In addition, we introduce the concept of slow slip seismicity during hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale and its importance to the reservoir stimulation process.  A preliminary analysis of data collected by a 2 Hz, three-component seismometer at the surface indicates the presence of this phenomenon and creates an opportunity to extend this research into the Appalachian Basin.|","Microseismic monitoring,  Fractals,  Marcellus Shale,  Slow Slip,  Geomechanics"

One reason of observed reductions in the conductivity of hydraulic fracture is failure of proppant pack under the stresses. Proppant deformation, crushing or embedment can decrease the fracture width and conductivity. In this paper, continuity equation and momentum balance equation were fully coupled to simulate the transient phenomena involving fluid flow through a deformable porous proppant pack. Porous media displacement, water pressure, and gas pressure were derived as primary unknowns. The governing equation was discretized using the finite element method and solved numerically. In this model, proppant pack and formation rocks were treated as two different types of continuous porous mediums (Biot type). Proppant deformation, crushing, and embedment could be identified through the geomechanical model, while the damage effects on gas/oil production would be studied through the fluid flow model. Analysis of proppant deformation and crushing was based on the proppant pack stress-strain behavior. The displacement on fracture-formation interface represented the proppant embedment. Mohr-Coulomb failure was used as the criteria for proppant crushing. Effects of proppant damage were evaluated on proppant pack porosity and permeability. The model can be applied in all the hydraulically fractured reservoir with proper inputs. In this paper, we used fractured tight sand gas reservoir as a study case. The pressure distribution as well as proppant pack deformation were illustrated in the paper.

The interpretation of microseismic data was initially focused on hydraulic fracture length and height, providing an important measurement to calibrate planar fracture propagation models. However, microseismic data in the Barnett shale exhibited significantly more complex patterns compared to typical tight-gas sands. The concept of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) was developed to provide some quantitative measure of stimulation effectiveness in the Barnett shale based on the size of the microseismic cloud. SRV is now ubiquitous when discussing well performance and stimulation effectiveness in unconventional reservoirs. However, SRV and similar techniques provide little insight into two critical parameters: hydraulic fracture area and conductivity. Each of these can vary significantly based on geologic conditions and fracture treatment design. Hydraulic fracture area and fracture conductivity, combined with reservoir permeability, stress regime, and rock properties, control well performance, not SRV. 
The concept of SRV has spawned numerous reservoir engineering models to approximate the production mechanisms associated with complex hydraulic fractures and to facilitate production modeling and well performance evaluations (e.g., rate transient analysis). However, these reservoir engineering models are often divorced from the fracture mechanics that created the fracture network, a significant limitation when evaluating completion effectiveness. Additionally, the interpretation of the microseismic data and the calculation of SRV are poorly linked to the actual hydraulic fracture geometry and distribution of fracture conductivity. 
This paper presents detailed numerical reservoir simulations coupled with hydraulic fracture modeling that illustrates the limitations and potential misapplications of the SRV concept. This work shows that simplifying assumptions in many SRV-based rate transient models may lead to estimates of hydraulic fracture length and reservoir permeability that are not well suited for completion optimization. Two case histories are presented that illustrate the limitations of SRV-based well performance evaluations. The paper concludes that using microseismic images to estimate a SRV may not be sufficient for completion evaluation and optimization.

A sizable amount of literature exists analyzing the effect of confining stress on fracture conductivity in sandstones.  This report attempts to answer similar questions with regard to shale formations.  The low Youngs Moduli and Brinell hardness values characteristic of many prospective shale formations may lead to a great deal of embedment and fines production which can drastically reduce fracture conductivity.  Furthermore, shales exhibit sensitivity to aqueous fluids which may cause them to be weakened in the presence of certain fracturing fluids.  Previous work analyzing shale fluid sensitivity has failed to preserve the shales formation properties by allowing the shale to dry out. 
This paper presents a study of propped fracture conductivity experiments at reservoir temperature and pressure using various North American shale reservoir cores.  Exposure to the atmosphere can alter the mechanical properties of the shale by either drying or hydrating the samples, so care was taken to preserve these shales in their native state by maintaining constant water activity (relative humidity).  Variations in applied closure stress and aqueous fluid exposure were analyzed and in certain cases altered the propped fracture conductivity by crushing proppant, embedding the proppant into the fracture face, and producing fines.  The damage to fracture conductivity is correlated to mineralogy for the various shale samples.  These findings show that a one-size-fits-all frac design will not work in every shale formation, rather a tailored approach to each shale is necessary. 
In the future, the results of this work will be analyzed alongside easier to perform Brinell hardness tests, swelling tests, and other characterization techniques incorporated into the UT Shale Characterization Protocol (Zhou et al., 2013).  Correlations were developed to relate the simpler tests to the fracture conductivity experiments will yield an easier method to determine the role embedment and fluid sensitivity have on post treatment fracture conductivity in shales.|","Shale,  Fluid Sensitivity,  Fracture Conductivity"

A comprehensive diagnostic data-fracturing campaign (Fracture Pressure Analysis: FPA) was undertaken by the Gas Fields Development Group (GFDG) of North Kuwait in January-March 2013. The campaign involved executing FPAs on the primary zone of interest (Organic-rich Carbonaceous Shale: OCS) as well as underlying and overlying carbonates to establish fraccability and in particular the hydraulic frac vertical containment aspect, which are much needed for the successful planning of an appraisal program.  
This paper summarizes the resuts of those FPA tests and how the acquired data is used to calibrate the wellbore geomechanical model. This initial FPA campaign is the onset of a more comprehensive evaluation program planned for 2013 onwards. FPA sequences were executed on the OCS, underlying and overlying formations with encouraging results. The main concern was whether the OCS would yield hydraulic fracture (fracture initiation) below surface treatment pressure limitation of 13,500 psi (Maximum allowable surface pressure). The fracture initiation was successfully established in all three zones. In addition, multiple fracture re-opening tests were performed to evaluate the ranges of the fracture closure stresses during the leak-off. Multiple down-hole memory gauges were utilized to ensure elimination of wellbore effects on treatment pressure. KCl-laden incompressible water-based fluid system enhanced with friction reducer was utilized in all three stages to ensure minimal friction loss and damage. This formation suite has very complex mineralogical attributes as it is a mixture of clastics, carbonates and hydrocarbons, with reservoirs that can be very tight (possibly at micro-Darcy).  
This campaign will lead to an optimal selection among the vertical completion options (hydro-fracturing design), and will help to successfully plan for horizontal well completions.|","Organic-rich Shale,  fracture closure pressure, Datafracs,  fracture initiation pressure,  fraccability,  Tight Gas Light Tight Oil,  fracture closure stress"

With the increasing wide use of hydraulic fractures in the petroleum industry it is essential to accurately predict the behavior of fractures based on the understanding of fundamental mechanisms governing the process. The prevailing approach for hydraulic fracture modeling relies on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). Generally, LEFM that uses stress intensity factor at the fracture tip, gives reasonable predictions for hard rock hydraulic fracturing processes, but often fails to give accurate predictions of fracture geometry and propagation pressure in soft/unconsolidated formations. The reasons are that the fracture process zone ahead of the crack tip , elasto-plastic  material  behavior  and  strong  coupling  between  flow  and  stress cannot be neglected in these formations. Recent laboratory testing has revealed that in many cases fracture propagation conditions cannot be described by traditional LEFM models. Rather, fractures develop in cohesive zones. In this study, we developed a fully coupled poroelastic and poroplastic hydraulic fracturing model with cohesive zone method which is able to model crack initiation and growth considering process zone effects. The impact of formation plastic properties on fracture process is investigated for both short term and long term injection and the results are compared with elastic formation. In addition, the main factors that affect the poroelastic backstress and the effects of formation plasticity on a hydraulic fracture are also investigated. The results indicate that both poroelastic backstress and formation plasticity lead to higher net pressure, but they have an opposite impact on fracture geometry. Poroelastic backstress tends to reduce fracture width while formation plasticity tends to increase fracture width. It was also observed that plasticity can reduce closure pressure below minimum horizontal stress. Poroelastic backstress is mostly controlled by the leak-off rate and formation permeability and the effects of plasticity are mostly influenced by in-situ stress, plastic properties and pore pressure. We also found that the effective toughness method which is used to quantify fracture process zone effect in soft formation tends to underestimate the fracture width and overestimate fracture length even if it can match the net pressure. Ignoring plasticity in certain formations can lead to inaccuracy of fracture geometry, net pressure prediction and fluid efficiency calculations. The deviations of real fracture geometry from elastic formation model can have great impact on well production, especially in unconventional, low-permeability reservoirs. So for a more accurate modeling of fracturing in plastic formation, the whole affected region around the fracture should be considered, especially when the plastic deformation area is large. |","poroelastic,  fracture geometry,  well production, hydraulic fracturing,  poroplastic"

The determination of the minimum horizontal in-situ stress is one of the most important aspects in the characterization of geomechanical behavior of petroleum reservoirs, since a good knowledge of such stress is critical in many activities of practical importance, including design of hydraulic fracturing treatments and estimation of the distribution of minimum horizontal stresses for reservoir simulation purposes. 
The main objective of the study is to calibrate well logs with available mini-frac data for estimating the minimum horizontal stress in the tight gas Monteith formation, Nikanassin Group of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). For deep formations like Monteith, the minimum stress is generally horizontal. Thus, the focus of this research is the minimum horizontal stress of the Monteith formation. 
First, actual values of the minimum horizontal stress at different well locations are acquired from the analysis of surface pressure data during mini-frac treatments. Next, the estimates calculated from an existing correlation and from actual minifrac data are matched for calibration purposes. Finally, Biots constant values are determined in order to generate a correlation applicable to the Monteith formation. Vertical Biots constants ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 are obtained in this study. Horizontal Biots constant is assumed to be equal to 1.0. 
Three vertical wells located in the same township with available compressional and shear sonic logs and mini-frac data are selected for this work.

The determination of the minimum horizontal in-situ stress is one of the most important aspects in the characterization of geomechanical behavior of petroleum reservoirs, since a good knowledge of such stress is critical in many activities of practical importance, including design of hydraulic fracturing treatments and estimation of the distribution of minimum horizontal stresses for reservoir simulation purposes. 
The main objective of the study is to calibrate well logs with available mini-frac data for estimating the minimum horizontal stress in the tight gas Monteith formation, Nikanassin Group of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). For deep formations like Monteith, the minimum stress is generally horizontal. Thus, the focus of this research is the minimum horizontal stress of the Monteith formation. 
First, actual values of the minimum horizontal stress at different well locations are acquired from the analysis of surface pressure data during mini-frac treatments. Next, the estimates calculated from an existing correlation and from actual minifrac data are matched for calibration purposes. Finally, Biots constant values are determined in order to generate a correlation applicable to the Monteith formation. Vertical Biots constants ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 are obtained in this study. Horizontal Biots constant is assumed to be equal to 1.0. 
Three vertical wells located in the same township with available compressional and shear sonic logs and mini-frac data are selected for this work. Five additional wells in the same general area are selected to assist in the analysis. The Monteith was hydraulically fractured in isolation in these wells. This aspect is important because there are many commingled completions in the area from which selective Monteith data are not available.

The study of propped fracture conductivity began in earnest with the development of the Cooke cell which later became part of the initial API standard.  Subsequent developments included a patented multi-cell design to conduct four tests in a press at the same time.  Other modifications have been used by various investigators.  Recent studies by the Stim-Lab proppant consortium have indicated that the flow field across a Cooke proppant conductivity testing cell may not be uniform as initially believed which resulted in significantly different conductivity results.  Post- test analysis of low temperature metal alloy injections at the termination of proppant testing prior to the release of the applied stress suggest that higher flow fields may be expected along the top of the proppant pack compared to the middle of the pack due to modifications made to the original Cooke cell design. To evaluate these experimental findings, a physics-based two-dimensional (2-D) discrete element model (DEM) was developed and applied to simulate stress distribution in the Cooke cell and proppant rearrangement during conductivity testing as a function of stress.  Numerical simulations of the testing apparatus are critical to understanding the impact of modification to the testing cell as well as understanding key proppant conductivity issues.  
The 2-D DEM model was constructed to represent a realistic cross-section of the Cooke cell with a distribution of four material properties, three that represent the Cooke cell (steel, sandstone, square rings), and one representing the proppant. In principle, Cooke cell materials can be approximated as assemblies of independent discrete elements (particles) of various sizes and material properties that interact via cohesive interactions, repulsive forces, and frictional forces. The macroscopic behavior can then be modeled as the collective behavior of many interacting discrete elements. This DEM model is particularly suitable for modeling proppant mechanical interactions subjected to an applied stress, where the experimental cell is represented as a cohesive body composed of a large number of discrete elements, and proppants can be modeled as the individual discrete particles with various sizes (following the proppant size distribution-density function used in the test) that exhibit no cohesive strength between the particles. 
Initial 2-D DEM modeling results suggest that proppant rearrangement and non-uniform stress distribution can develop across the proppant pack due to square ring modifications. Compaction along the edge of the proppant pack beneath the square ring seal result in a disproportionate lower flow field along these edges as compared to the middle of the proppant pack. These results suggest that reported conductivity values determined by the Cooke cell may be biased to overestimate the actual conductivity of the proppant due to modifications to the standard Cooke cell. Such modifications should be carefully evaluated as to their consequences on determining the proppant conductivity.|","DEM model,  Cooke Cell, Proppant"

Diagnostic fracture injection tests (DFIT) are commonly used to characterize stress and reservoir properties in unconventional reservoirs. Although simple in concept, interpreting DFIT results can be difficult because several factors can cause results to deviate from ideal DFIT behavior. Some examples of nonideal DFIT behavior include steep pressure declines after shut-in, absence of pseudolinear and pseudoradial flow, and excessive storage indications. Such deviations from ideal DFIT behavior challenge our ability to estimate formation properties reliably. Potential drivers of nonideal behavior include heterogeneous rock properties, complex rock/fluid interaction, thermal effects, phase entry, and natural fractures. 
The objective of this study is to investigate how these factors can impact DFIT results and interpretations. A comprehensive approach was taken using a combination of pressure transient analysis, frac modeling, analytical leakoff modeling, and detailed numerical simulation of DFIT behavior. The application was for a horizontal well, completed in a shale gas reservoir, which included an actual field DFIT. Detailed modeling included full wellbore transients and storage, hydraulic behavior through induced fractures, as well as complex interactions between rock, fluids, and natural fractures. It was determined that the actual DFIT showed indications of a complex network created by the pump-in. Closure pressure estimates were found to be reliable, between the simulation cases and DFIT analysis. However, a consistency check on initial reservoir pressure had to be used to obtain reasonable estimates compared to the simulation input. Finally, estimates of reservoir conductivity were highly uncertain compared to the actual simulation inputs. Furthermore, the actual DFIT estimates of reservoir pressure and conductivity were found to be overoptimistic. Estimated ultimate recovery using DFIT-based estimates of reservoir quality was shown to be more than twice the estimated ulterimate recovery using reservoir quality estimates made with integrated core, log, and a pressure build-up test.|","numerical simulation,  formation stress, diagnostic fracture injection,  reservoir characterization,  natural fractures"

The identification of fracture barrier is important for optimizing horizontal well drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and protecting fresh aquifer from contamination. The word brittleness has been a prevalent descriptor in unconventional shale reservoir characterization, but there is no universal agreement regarding its definition. Here a new definition of mineralogical brittleness is proposed and verified with two independent methods of defining brittleness. Formation with higher brittleness is considered as good fracturing candidate. However, this viewpoint is not reasonable because brittleness does not indicate rock strength. For instance, fracture barrier between upper and lower Barnett can be dolomitic limestone with higher brittleness. A new fracability index is introduced to overcome the shortcoming of brittleness by integrating both brittleness and energy dissipation during hydraulic fracturing. This fracability index considers that a good formation for hydraulic fracturing is not only of high brittleness, but also requires less energy to create a new fracture surface. Therefore, the formation with lower fracability index is considered as a fracture barrier, while with higher fracability is considered as better fracturing candidate. Logging data from one well of Barnett shale is applied (1) to verify the principle of new brittleness and fracability index model; (2) and to demonstrate the process of screening hydraulic fracturing candidates employing fracability index model.|","Fracability, Brittleness,  Fracture barrier,  Fracture containment,  Fracture toughness"

The design and evaluation of hydraulic fracture modeling is critical for efficient production from tight gas and shale plays. The efficiency of fracturing jobs depends on the interaction between hydraulic (induced) and naturally occurring discrete fractures. We describe a coupled reservoir-fracture flow model which accounts for varying reservoir geometries and complexities including non-planar fractures, faults and barriers. In addition our model is coupled with linear elasticity using iterative coupling to solve a multi-phase Biot system. The approach presented here is in contrast with existing averaging approaches such as dual and discrete-dual porosity models where the effects of fractures are averaged out. We model the fractures and reservoirs explicitly, which allows us to capture the flow details and impact of fractures more accurately. Moreover, accurate modeling of solid deformations necessitates a better estimation of fluid pressure inside fracture, which our flow model provides. We utilize different flow models for the fractures and the reservoir closely capturing physics when needed. A quantitative comparison is made in order to identify situations where a multiphysics flow description is critical to accurate prediction compared to an averaging based approach. We present several numerical tests, including a field scale case study, to illustrate the above features and their impact on recovery predictions. |","multipoint flux, multi-physics,  discrete,  hydraulic,  poro-elastic"

Microseismic monitoring has become an attractive option for tracking hydraulic fracture stimulations because, unlike most other monitoring techniques, it can illuminate the behavior of fractures away from treatment wells. However, in most cases, the potential for microseismics in terms of developing an overall picture of fracture interactions within the reservoir is not fully exploited. Based on the analysis of microseismicity associated with stimulations in naturally fractured shale reservoirs, we illustrate how, using advanced seismic signal analysis techniques, namely seismic moment tensor inversion (SMTI) approaches, we can stimulate a pre-existing fracture network. As well, we can identify: 1) the failure type, such as shear or tensile failure associated with rough fracture surfaces, 2) the fracture connectivity related to the number of intersecting fractures in a volume, 3) the fracture intensity based on the developed fracture lengths per volume, 4) the fluid flow pathways and enhanced fluid flow volume as related to the relative degree of open fractures, and 5) the distribution of fracture lengths (power law distribution). Based on our analysis, we identify that most failures observed are mixed-mode failures, typically shear-tensile with either crack opening or crack closure components of failure. The fractures themselves are generally related to the failure of pre-existing natural fractures rather than in the creation of new fractures. Based on the finite sampling (bandwidth limitations), fracture sizes are limited to joint lengths and follow a power law distribution. By examining the spatial and temporal behavior of opening dominated failures, maps of over-lapping zones of potential enhanced fluid flow were identified. In many ways, stress induced fractures during single stages prepared the reservoir for subsequent stages that overall enhanced the interconnectivity and complexity of fractures thereby enhancing fluid flow opportunities. We further discuss, as outlined in these case studies, how, using SMTI, the microseismic data show that the stimulation program as designed achieved its objectives. Overall, we further suggest that these defined seismic parameters can then be used to refine, validate and constrain geomechanical models used as input to reservoir models and further optimize well and stage spacing to effectively drain a reservoir and provide better defined reserve estimates.|","Seismic Moment Tensor, Microseismic Monitoring,  Discrete Fracture Network"

Recent arguments about the possibility of underground water pollution in particular regions have raised significant concerns regarding wellbore integrity during hydraulic fracturing in shallow formations. In this paper, we take a look at the containment of annulus cracks that might develop during hydraulic fracturing treatments. Wellbore integrity is highly dependent on the integrity of the bonding between the cement and the formation as well as the bonding between casing and cement. Cement heterogeneity resulted from unsmooth borehole surfaces, complex geological conditions, mud cakes, and cement contamination. Excessive fluid pressure during hydraulic fracturing could provide the driving force not only for initiation and propagation of fractures in longitudinal and transverse directions, but also in cases of low confining pressure, it may lead to fracture propagation around the casing, i.e. annulus cracks. A coupled three-dimensional poroelastic model with embedded cohesive zones is used to simulate different fracture propagation scenarios that may occur in vertical and horizontal wells during hydraulic fracturing stimulations. The cohesive layer theory is utilized to model initiation and propagation of transverse, longitudinal and delamination fractures. Using the numerical analysis provided in this paper, few hydraulic fracturing cases were simulated by taking the advantage of the treatment pressure data and petrophysical logs, and the results were compared with the post-treatment radioactive tracer logs available for these wells.|","perforation,  cement sheath,  hydraulic fracturing, Well integrity"

Hydraulic fracture propagation through a layered medium often exhibits a complex fracture path due to lateral shifting of the fracture path after passing through an interface. The existence of these offsets in the fracture path has been confirmed by mapping of mined fractures and by laboratory experiments. In addition to the stress contrast and material contrast, these offsets act as another mechanism for fracture-height containment. In order to investigate fracture height growth problem, we have considered a case of plane-strain fractures propagating from an injection point and propagating in a predetermined path. Fracture offsets of a given length and angle are prescribed within the predetermined path. In this way, we parametrize the problem of fracture offsets in order to quantify their effects on the fracture height growth and fracture opening reduction at the fracture offset (pinching effect). This is done while keeping a hydrostatic state of confining stresses in order to observe only the geometric effect of the fracture offset. We use a recently developed hydraulic fracturing code based on the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). This code solves the fluid flow in the fracture and the elastic response of the fracture in a fully coupled manner solving for the fracture velocity using the complete hydraulic fracture tip asymptotics. 
For different combinations of independent parameters (i.e., formation moduli, far-field stresses, fluid injection rate, ratio of offset length to the length of the straight fracture and the offset angles) we investigate the effect on the fracture height growth and the reduction in fracture opening at the fracture offset. A detailed parametric study shows that while each parameter affects the fracture height containment, the fracture opening reduction is dominated by the fracture offset angle which is a geometric effect of the fracture offsets. This has a profound effect on the proppant bridging at the fracture offset.|","Fracture Offsets,  Stress Contrast,  Hydraulic Fracture, Height Containment,  XFEM"

Economical production rates in shale reservoirs are achieved solely by hydraulic fracturing the pay zones on horizontal wells with multiple stages, thus this technique is an essential tool for the development of enormous reserves of oil and gas in the United States. However, the processes that dominate hydraulic fracturing in shale reservoirs are poorly understood, and the variability of the properties from one shale play to another makes this learning process intricate. In this paper, we investigate the evidence of microfracture propagation on ductile shales and the key factors that constrain its slippage. First of all, we present evidence from the study of two reservoirs, the Eagle Ford formation in South Texas and the Vaca Muerta formation in Argentina. Secondly, we analyze the key parameters that affect flow through microfractures in organic-rich mudstones. We identify the key variables used to characterize these reservoirs through integration of geomechanics laboratory experiments with microseismic monitoring, mineralogy, organic carbon content, fabric, log, core, geological and field data analysis. Our ultimate goal is to identify the main parameters that influence fracture flow from very tight shales with the ultimate goal of optimizing the completion design in these complex formations. With this objective in mind, we examine the relatively slow slip process of tensile fracture growth in ductile, high clay and organic content shales, which results in the reactivation of preexisting horizontal fractures, producing aseismic energy. We then compare this mechanism against the fast shearing deformation that generates microseismicity in brittle shales. By observing the differences between the macro-scale (microseismic, anisotropy of the acoustic waves, geomechanics experiments), the meso-scale (fabric-thin section) and the micro- and nano-scales (clay particles) we suggest that the mechanisms of fracturing on ductile versus brittle rock are seen at any scale; that the anisotropy of the fabric of the rock within the interface between clay and non-clay minerals that differ in size and strength, the anisotropy of the horizontal stresses, the overpressure conditions, the friction angle of kerogen, the orientation of the pre-existing microfracture network with respect to the current stress state and to a lesser extent- the elastic moduli of the rock matrix, are the most significant parameters that dominate microfracture propagation mechanisms on organically-rich rocks. The systematic integration of data from two analogous shale reservoirs and its comparison against existing theories on the mechanisms of fracture propagation has the benefit of approaching the process of fracturing from a predictive perspective, with potential benefits on stimulation optimization.|","Microfracture,  Vaca Muerta,  Geomechanics, Shale,  Eagle Ford"

We investigate fracture propagation induced by hydraulic fracturing with water-injection, using numerical simulation. For full 3D rigorous modeling, we employ a numerical method that can model failure due to tensile and shear stresses, dynamic nonlinear permeability, the dual continuum approach, leak-off in all directions, and thermo-poro-mechanical effects. From the numerical results, fracture propagation is not the same as propagation of the water front, because fracturing is governed by geomechanics, whereas water saturation is determined by fluid flow. At early times, the water saturation front is almost identical to the fracture tip, showing that the fracture is mostly filled with injected water. However, at late times, advance of the water front is retarded, compared to the fracture propagation, yielding a significant gap between the water front and the fracture top, which is filled with reservoir gas. We also find considerable leak-off of water to the reservoir. The inconsistency between the fracture volume and the volume of injected water cannot properly estimate the fracture length, when it is estimated based on the simple assumption that the fracture is fully saturated with injected water. As an example of flow-geomechanical responses, we identify pressure fluctuation under constant water injection, because hydraulic fracturing is itself a set of many failure processes, in which pressure drops every time when failure occurs. The fluctuation decreases as the fracture length grows. |We also study application of electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods, because the EM geophysical methods are highly sensitive to changes in porosity and pore-fluid properties, such as water injection into gas reservoirs. We employ a 3D finite-element EM geophysical simulator and evaluate the sensitivity of the crosswell EM method for monitoring fluid movements in shaly reservoirs. For the sensitivity evaluation, reservoir models are generated through the coupled flow-geomechanical simulator and are transformed via a rock physics model into electrical conductivity models. It is shown that anomalous conductivity distribution in the resulting models is closely related with injected water saturation but little with newly-created unsaturated fractures. The numerical modeling experiments demonstrate that the crosswell EM method can be highly sensitive to conductivity changes that directly indicate the migration pathways of the injected fluid. Accordingly, the EM method can serve as an effective monitoring tool for distribution of injected water (i.e. migration pathways) during hydraulic fracturing operations.|","Fracture Propagation,  Electromagnetic Survey,  Coupled Flow and Geomechanics,  Shale Gas,  Hydraulic Fracturing"

The use of multiple clusters per stage can reduce the number of stages needed to place a given number of fractures in a horizontal wellbore.  However, there is concern that some of the perforation clusters may not propagate fractures at all as the fractures compete for frac fluid and fracture width. In this paper, the influence of various hydraulic fracturing design parameters and in-situ conditions on the resulting fracture dimensions and propagation patterns is studied. A 3D geo-mechanical model was built using ABAQUS to simulate the propagation of multiple competing fractures in a horizontal well.  The reservoir was modeled as a porous elastic medium using pore pressure stress elements, and a plane of pore pressure cohesive elements was inserted at each perforation cluster to model fracture propagation.  Also, flow distribution among perforation clusters was simulated using a parallel resistors model. 
Using this model, a number of simulations were run with a combination of perforation cluster spacing, number of perforation clusters, fracture height, frac fluid viscosity, pumping rate, Youngs modulus of the target formation, and formation heterogeneity.  The results demonstrated that increasing perforation cluster spacing or decreasing the number of perforation clusters reduced stress interference between the fractures, and more fractures propagated.  A high frac fluid viscosity increased fracture widths and led to more stress interference.  Higher pumping rates led to longer and wider fractures, and to an increase in the number of propagated fractures.  Thicker target formations and taller fractures required wider perforation cluster spacing.  Additionally, a higher Young's modulus of the target formation led to more fracture interference, suggesting wider cluster spacing.  Lastly, the introduction of any degree of heterogeneity significantly altered the fracture propagation patterns noted above. 
Based on the results of these simulations, the following recommendations are made.  First, there exists an optimum number of perforation clusters per fracture stage. This optimum depends primarily on the fracture design, the stage spacing and the mechanical properties of the formation.  Second, slick water fracs have a better chance (compared to more viscous fluids) of propagating uniform multiple fractures when closely spaced multiple perforation clusters are used.  Third, higher pumping rate should be adopted to ensure that a fracture propagates from all perforation clusters.  Fourth, even small scale heterogeneities should be considered, as they can significantly alter the fracture propagation pattern.  Lastly, when the target formation is relatively thick or has a high Youngs modulus, a wider fracture spacing, a higher pumping rate, and a lower viscosity frac fluid should be used.|","perforation spacing,  competing fractures, fracture spacing,  growth,  hydraulic fracturing,  simultaneous propagation,  horizontal well"

Designing hydraulic fracture stimulation to optimize well productivity requires knowledge of the initial reservoir pressure and permeability, the closure stress magnitudes in the reservoir and in bounding formations, a carrier fluid with a suitable leakoff coefficient, and rock properties such as the Youngs modulus and the Poisson ratio that can be determined from a core sample. When key parameters are left unknown, the hydraulic fracture stimulation is likely to be severely suboptimal. 
This study integrates pressure buildup and production transient analyses with microseismic surveys and the recorded pumping schedule to estimate the above-mentioned parameters in previously fractured wells on production for up to 7 years from a tight gas reservoir. 
The first well drilled and completed in the block included a pressure buildup test that enabled accurate estimation of the initial reservoir pressure and permeability. A post-fracture buildup test was also conducted, and annual pressure buildup tests in 6 subsequent years showed continuous changes in the fracture morphology with fracture conductivity decreasing by a factor of 3 and fracture length increasing by about 50%. Many of the subsequent wells were drilled in 2 pattern well clusters, each designed to account for fracture propagation behavior indicated from a microseismic survey. A comparison with an optimal hydraulic fracture design intended to maximize well productivity indicates that most of the well stimulations were suboptimal with rate and cumulative production about <U+00BD> that of an optimized design based on the same proppant mass. 
The observed changes in fracture conductivity and length over time were unanticipated. Because such data are rarely recorded the variations in fracture morphology may be fairly typical and should be of considerable interest to pressure transient analysts. The production data analysis shows the difficulties in determining formation and fracture parameters when the transient response lacks radial flow. The fracture treatment analysis shows a comparison between the actual fracture treatment and one designed to maximize well productivity and clearly illustrates the potential for well improvement using modern hydraulic fracture design principles.|","treatment evaluation, tight gas,  stimulation design,  transient analysis,  microseismic"

This offers the possibility to simulate the entire scenario from hydraulic fracturing to the production process.

When a well is hydraulically fractured, the propagation of the fracture away from the wellbore is dictated by the far field stresses in the reservoir.   However, the fracture initiation from the wellbore depends strongly on the near wellbore stress state created by drilling the well.  Misaligned fracture initiation and propagation planes can reduce the wellbore-to-reservoir connectivity causing operation failure and high post fracturing skin. 
Currently creating multiple fractures along a horizontal openhole requires mechanical isolation means such as openhole packers or sand plugs. They can be costly and time consuming. In addition, there is no control of fracture initiation within one isolated section.  Undesirable competing fractures within the zone can occur to impact the fracture length. Significant improvement can be made if the factors controlling multiple fracture initiation without mechanical isolation can be understood. 
Experimental work in multiple fracture initiation has been rare, controlled multiple fracture initiation is non-existent. Therefore a series of laboratory experiments was performed in a true tri-axial stress frame to investigate how multiple fractures can be initiated in a controllable fashion. In the tests, notches at specific locations along the openhole wellbore were created. The impact of the notch depth on the orientation of the hydraulically induced fractures was studied. 
In addition to the experiments, continuum fracture mechanics modeling using finite element was also conducted to rationalize the experimental observations of fracturing initiation process in the rock. 
The results of block tests provided new insight in multiple fracture initiation. By monitoring the real time acoustic emission events, the sequence of fracture creation as wellbore pressure increased was visualized. The finite element modeling gives simple criteria to explain the observed orientation of initiated fracture as a function of notch depth. |","carbonate,  acid fracturing,  fracture initiation,  multiple fracturing, Horizontal wells"

The technologies under investigation use steam and alternative working fluids, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrocarbons. All the fluids investigated in this project are natural working fluids; hence, they will not cause any unexpected environmental issues in the future. A case study was performed that considered an 18-year period of operation on an actual platform and a scenario in which one gas turbine was removed and replaced with a CO2 bottoming cycle by use of the exhaust heat from a different gas turbine. The beauty of this scenario is that it would not increase the weight on the platform because the crate containing the gas turbine to be removed was of a weight similar to that of the crate containing the CO2 bottoming cycle. The substitution would not affect the ability to cover the heat demand on the platform because a waste-heat-recovery unit (WHRU) could be installed on the platform's other gas turbine. The case study indicates a significant reduction in CO2 emissions of 22% (63 000 t/a), and does not involve adding additional weight or volume to the platform. If operating on the NCS, the annual savings in reduced fuel costs and CO2 tax from implementing this scenario would be USD 17 million, although much lower in other territories.|","Offshore, Energy Efficiency, Gas , Oil"

For heavy-oil reservoirs, the oil viscosity usually varies dramatically during production processes such as in thermal processes. When producing heavy oil, the high viscosity is a major impediment to recovery. Oil viscosity is often correlated directly to the reserves estimate in heavy-oil formations and can determine the success or failure of a given enhanced-oil-recovery scheme. As a result, viscosity is an important parameter for performing numerical simulation and determining the economics of a project. In this work, a simple-to-use correlation has been developed to correlate the viscosity of heavy oil to temperature and to a simple correlating parameter that can be used for heavy-oil characterization. The reported results are the product of the analysis of heavy-oil data collected from the open literature for various heavy-oil fields around the world. The tool developed in this study can be of immense practical value for petroleum engineers, providing a method for quick assessment of the viscosity of heavy oils. In particular, petroleum and production engineers would find the proposed correlation to be user-friendly, with transparent calculations involving no complex expressions. The new proposed correlation shows consistently accurate results. This consistency could not be matched by any of the widely accepted existing correlations within the investigated range. For all conditions, the new correlation provided better results than existing correlations in the literature.|","viscosity, correlation, heavy oil"

Literature review shows that improved oil recovery (IOR) by low-salinity waterflooding could be attributed to several mechanisms, such as sweep-efficiency improvement, interfacial-tension (IFT) reduction, multicomponent ionic exchange, and electrical-double layer (EDL) expansion. Although these mechanisms might contribute to IOR by low-salinity water, they may not be the primary mechanism. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate if the mechanism of EDL expansion could be the principal reason for IOR during low-salinity waterflooding. Low-salinity water results in a thicker EDL when compared to high-salinity water, so we tried to eliminate the effect of low-salinity brines on double-layer expansion to show to what extent IOR is related to EDL expansion caused by low-salinity water. The double-layer expansion is dependent on the electric surface charge, which is a function of the pH of brine; therefore, the pH levels of low-salinity brines were decreased in this study to provide low-salinity brines that can produce a thinner EDL, similar to high-salinity brines. Zeta-potential measurements were performed on both rock/brine and oil/brine interfaces to demonstrate the effect of brine pH and salinity on EDL. Contact angle and coreflood experiments were conducted to test different brine salinities at different pH values, which could assess the effect of water salinity and pH on rock wettability and oil recovery, and hence involvement of EDL expansion in the IOR process. Zeta-potential results in this study showed that decreasing the pH of low-salinity brines makes the electrical charges at both oil/ brine and brine/rock interfaces slightly negative, which reduces the double-layer expansion caused by low-salinity brine. As a result, the rock becomes more oil-wet, which was confirmed by contact-angle measurements. Moreover, coreflood experiments indicated that injecting low-salinity brine at lower pH values recovered smaller amounts of oil when compared to the original pH because of the elimination of the low-salinity-water effect on the thickness of the double layer. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that expansion of the double layer is a dominant mechanism of oil-recovery improvement by low-salinity waterflooding.|","low salinity flood, secondary recovery, sandstone, IOR, zeta potential"

During hydraulic-fracturing operations in low-permeability formations, spontaneous imbibition of fracturing fluid into the rock matrix is believed to have a significant impact on the retention of water-based fracturing fluids in the neighborhood of the induced fracture. This may affect the post-fracturing productivity of the well. However, there is lack of direct experimental and visual evidence of the extent of fluid retention, evolution of the resulting imbibing-fluid front, and how they relate to potential productivity hindrance. In this paper, laboratory experiments have been carefully designed to represent the vicinity of a hydraulic fracture. The evolution of fracturing fluid leakoff is monitored as a function of space and time by use of X-ray computed tomography (CT). The X-ray CT imaging technique allows us to map saturations at controlled time intervals to monitor the migration of fracturing fluid into the reservoir formation. It is generally expected for low-permeability formations (5 to 10 md) to show strong capillary forces because of their small characteristic pore radii, but this driving mechanism is in competition with the low permeability and spatial heterogeneities found in low-permeability sands. The relevance of capillarity as a driver of fluid migration and retention in a low-permeability sand sample is interpreted visually and quantified and compared with high-permeability Berea sandstone in our experiments. It is seen that although low-permeability sands are subject to strong capillary forces, the effect can be suppressed by the low permeability of the formation and the heterogeneous nature of the sample. Nevertheless, saturation values attained as a result of spontaneous imbibition are comparable with those obtained for high-permeability samples. Leakoff of fracturing fluids during the shut-in period of a well can result in delayed gas flowback and can hinder gas production. Results from this investigation are expected to provide fundamental insight regarding critical variables affecting the retention and migration of water-based fracturing fluids in the neighborhood of hydraulic fractures, and consequently affecting the post-fracturing productivity of the well.|","spontaneous imbibition, hydraulic fracturing, tight sand"

Ultralarge-diameter polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC)-bit drilling is a fast-growing cost-effective solution in high-tier deepwater drilling operations in the US Gulf of Mexico (GOM) where salt is encountered in the shallow part of the wellbore. Conventional design called for roller-cone (RC) (IADC Code 111-115) drill bits on positive-displacement motors (PDMs) in these ultralarge- diameter intervals. Cost savings on drilling fluid alone, in the form of rate-of-penetration (ROP) gains through the salt interval, has the industry trending to drill these riserless sections with the use of PDC drill bits on rotary-steerable-system (RSS) drilling assemblies. New robust high-torque-capacity topdrives, stronger drillpipe (DP) connections, larger-diameter RSS tools, and improved mud programs have all largely contributed to this step change in drilling performance. In addition, evolved bit and bottomhole-assembly (BHA) design, efficient operating parameters, improved hydraulics, and vibration-prediction modeling have all aided in the success of these runs. Although this emerging new trend reduces drilling times and associated cost, experience has shown there are multiple challenges that must be overcome to complete a successful run in a single trip. These challenges vary from well to well and include, but are not limited to, BHA steerability, rig-equipment limitations, efficient operating parameters, identification of both sediment and salt formations, hole cleaning and hydraulics, salt creep, drilling-fluid displacement, DP torque limitations, stabilization placement, lateral/ torsional BHA vibrations, and others. This paper will concentrate on the multiple aspects of ultralarge- diameter riserless PDC-bit drilling applications and the considerations that have been used to optimize them. Prior SPE papers and data from previous deepwater GOM case histories were heavily researched and scrutinized to support the conclusions provided within the body of this paper. Together with industry experience available, these findings have resulted in a set of defined recommendations, providing operators with a guide to justify a lower-cost-per-foot approach through the potential reduction of drilling time in these challenging applications.|","deepwater, optimization, PDC bits, Gulf of Mexico, drilling"

A proppant-filled fracture induces mechanical stresses in the surrounding rock that cause a reduction in the horizontal-stress contrast and stress reorientation around the open fracture. A 3D geomechanical model is used to simulate the stress reorientation caused by open fractures and to generate horizontal-stress-contrast contour maps. The reduction in horizontal-stress contrast can lead to increased fracture complexity. This paper describes ways to increase fracture complexity by varying the completion design. In this paper, we identify the impact of operator-controllable variables in a completion design on fracture complexity. This can lead to more-effective completion designs that improve well productivity, reservoir drainage, and, ultimately, the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). The possibility of greater fracture complexity and reduced/effective fracture spacing and, thus, a higher drainage area is demonstrated for the alternate fracturing sequence in comparison to the conventional fracturing sequence. The Youngs-modulus value of the shale and the in-situ horizontal-stress contrast are shown to be significant factors controlling the extent of fracture complexity generated in a given reservoir. In addition, the effect of proppant mass injected per stage is also shown to significantly impact fracture complexity. We provide optimal ranges of fracture spacing and proppant volume for the various shale formations analyzed. The use of these guidelines should result in more fracture complexity than would otherwise be observed.The results presented in the paper provide the operator with the knowledge to design completions and fracture treatments (proppant volume, fracture spacing, and sequencing) to maximize reservoir drainage and to increase EURs. This should lead to more-effective completion designs.|","fracture complexity, stress contrast, Texas two step, horizontal well, hydraulic fracturing"

To test the effectiveness of the Re-Os system for tracing source rocks and marking the time of maturation and expulsion, we examined a natural system in which key variables are controlled.  Hydrocarbon source rocks (Late Ordovician Fjacka shale) and adjacent, partly contemporaneous reservoir rocks (carbonate mounds) are exceptionally well exposed in quarries, drill core and outcrop in the Siljan area of central Sweden.  At 377 Ma, a giant meteorite impacted the region heating Early Paleozoic sections, including immature Ordovician-Silurian hydrocarbon source rocks.  Oil seeps and asphaltene coatings in carbonates just outside the Siljan impact crater attest to hydrocarbon maturation associated with the impact.  The size of the impact supports elevated temperatures over a maturation-migration period of 10 to 1000 Ka, not unlike that for some sedimentary basins.  The Siljan ""field laboratory?? permits sampling of source rock and migrated oils in immediately adjacent units - uniquely, with the time of maturation temporally pinned by the bolide impact.  Through Re-Os analyses of the source rock and analyses of the oil it generated, we found the Re-Os isotopic system to be intact at two of three shale localities, obtaining the expected late Ordovician and early Silurian depositional ages.  In contrast, the Re-Os isotopic compositions and erratically varying Os concentrations derived from the oil seeps suggest infusion of shale-derived oil with Os derived from the bolide.  Thus, we show that shales generally retain their Os isotopic systematics, even under extraordinary circumstances, whereas small quantities of migrating oil at Siljan were easily overwhelmed by the strong Os isotopic signature carried by the bolide.  
A unique opportunity at the Siljan impact site 
Seventy percent of meteorites leave their mark in the sedimentary record[1], yet little is known about the response of sedimentary targets on impact.  The consequences of meteorite impacts for the continental and oceanic sedimentary record inform questions of climate change and mass extinction, both critical concepts to understanding deposition of source rocks.  For two reasons, application of the Re-Os isotopic system to impacted black shales provides a unique opportunity to examine hydrocarbon maturation and migration.  First, the extreme contrast between Re-Os concentrations and Os isotope compositions in sedimentary versus extraterrestrial reservoirs readily permits detection of both end members.  Second, maturation and migration are nearly coincident and reduced to a geologic instant at the moment of impact.  That moment is a well-dated heating event at 377 Ma - the impact age of the giant Siljan bolide smashing into the Late Devonian (Frasnian) seabed.  
Re-Os and hydrocarbons 
Key inputs for modeling hydrocarbon systems are identity of source rock(s) and the maturation and migration time(s).  Typically, biomarkers are used to link migrated hydrocarbons to specific source rocks.  This tool may be compromised by biodegradation of the oils, however.  Time of maturation is generally estimated from models of burial history and is therefore dependent on estimates of biostratigraphic ages, sediment thickness and compaction history, and subsidence rates.  Re-Os geochemistry overcomes some of these limitations and assumptions, serving as an intact tracer with a clear time component; biodegradation does not appear to compromise Re-Os systematics.|","dating source rock, Re-Os geochronology,  Siljan bolide impact,  Sweden,  Ordovician-Silurian shale"

Integration of technologies and application of innovative practices in drilling, completion, acid stimulation, and hydraulic fracturing have significantly contributed to the successful development of tight gas reservoirs. The well planning and development procedures entail careful selection of several critical parameters such as drilling azimuth, lateral length, well trajectory, drill-in fluids, well completion methods, stimulation fluid properties, fracture placement technique, proppant types, treatment volumes, and pumping schedule. All of these critical parameters impact fracture dimensions, proppant transport and placement, as well as stimulation efficiency and effective post-frac cleanup. |Depending on reservoir rock properties and stress profile in the near wellbore (NWB) and the far field, the effectiveness of hydraulic stimulation in connecting the wellbore to the undamaged virgin reservoir, as well as maximizing reservoir contact area and enhancing flow back of treatment fluids to restore proppant conductivity, dictate the well potential, sustainable gas rate level, and ultimate recovery.

Production of formation sand and other solids with wellstreams has been a big challenge in the petroleum industry. Presence of sand in the production stream can cause erosion of upstream facilities and - even more commonly - clogging of flowlines and accumulation in production vessels; reducing residence time and performance of separator internals. 
Several methods have been applied in the petroleum industry to remove deposited sand from production vessels. Some of the drawbacks with these technologies are: localized sand removal, excessive use of water, interference on vessel liquid levels, compromise of water and oil quality, risks of clogging, huge sand system infrastructural size etc. Direct consequence of these situations would be unmanageable disturbances on production operations, and eventually leading to unplanned shutdown, and production loss. 
Recent innovations on design of vessel desanding internals at FMC Technologies are the Dual and Single Vessel Desanding Systems. While the dual desanding system integrates a set of systematically arranged jet nozzles and a novel hydrodynamically designed suction system, the single desanding system is a unique combination of a smart elliptical fluidization technique and suction in a single compact design. This paper presents both technologies, with special focus on their developments and qualifications. Case studies are presented; highlighting the benefits of the new technologies, as well as their application possibilities.

Introduction 
Sand and other solid particles are usually produced with oil, gas and water from most reservoirs in the world.  In the United States, reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico, California and Texas tend to produce more sand. Around the world, sand production is common in West Africa, Canada, China, Venezuela Trinidad, Cameroon, Middle East, Indonesia and parts of the North Sea1. The phenomenon of sand production is directly related to any/combination of the following: unconsolidated nature of some reservoirs, high drag forces created by increased produced fluid and accelerated water influx. 
As explained by the illustrative schematics in figure 1, disintegrated sand particles from the formation rock matrix are transported up the wellbore, through the production system. Thus unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs would tend to produce more sand particles, especially when the wells are becoming mature, with lots more water influxing. Proppant solids are also produced from wells following fracturing treatment programs. 
Although downhole sand control mechanisms are usually in place in most wells, certain cut-size of sand particles would eventually get produced to the surface because wide particle size distributions always exist in the reservoir. This ranges from 1micron to over 10,000 micron. Sand particles produced to the surface leads to a wide range of operational challenges.|","Research & Development,  Online vessel desanding"

Hydrocarbon reservoir operation, i.e. fluid extraction and injection, are responsible for volumetric changes of reservoir itself resulting in surface deformation phenomena (subsidence or uplift). This processes are controlled by the tectonic framework which is responsible for reservoir compartmentalization and/or fault reactivation. Monitoring surface deformations can provide valuable constraints for modeling the dynamic behavior of a reservoir and help achieve more effective reservoir exploitation with obvious economic benefits. Advanced satellite interferometry represents one of the most valuable and cost-effective techniques, capable of providing high precision and high areal density displacement measurements over long periods of time. 
Introduction 
Since 1978, when the first radar images of the Earth's surface were acquired from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors mounted on satellites, SAR interferometry (InSAR) data are gaining increasing attention for their unique technical features and cost-effectiveness, able to provide high-quality, remotely acquired data about surface movements over large areas. 
In particular, in the late 90's a new technique, called PSInSAR (Ferretti et al., 2001), was developed and patented by the Department of Electronics at the Polytechnic University of Milan (POLIMI), considered a real ice-breaker by the InSAR community. By processing multi-temporal radar acquisitions this technique is able to detect millimetre surface deformations, over long periods and large areas. In few years this technique, later improved by Tele-Rilevamento Europa (TRE), a spin-off company of POLIMI, has become a standard tool for studying and monitoring the territory and nowadays is commonly used both for civil protection applications by regional governments, water authorities, research centers and numerous companies in different market sectors. 
Following a brief recall of some basic InSAR concepts, advanced InSAR techniques support in precisely monitoring surface deformation will be presented through the analysis of two selected case studies. The first one, is relevant to a tectonically active area, where surface displacement measurements provided a valuable support in assessing the evolution of a seismoactive fault system; the second one, relevant to a compartmentalized reservoir in Middle East, shows the effectiveness of Advanced InSAR data in constraining the subsurface deformation related to fluid extraction/injection from underground reservoirs and calibrating hydrocarbon reservoir geomechanical model. 
Tecnology Overview 
InSAR is a remote sensing tool that measures ground displacement (Hanssen R., 2001; Kampes B., 2006; Ketelaar V.B.H., 2009). Radar sensors mounted on specific satellites transmit radar signals toward the earth, some of which reflect off objects on the ground, bouncing back to the satellite. These back scattered' signals are captured by the satellite's sensors and are used to compile radar images of the earth's surface. Radar signals are unaffected by darkness or clouds, in terms of visibility of the land surface. As clouds do not obstruct the passage of the satellite signal, satellite platforms mounting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems can function 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.|","satellite,  InSAR,  reservoir monitoring"

The increased demand for more sources of clean energy such as natural gas from unconventional reservoirs has forced the industry to explore the more challenging tight gas reservoirs. Tight gas reservoirs constitute a significant proportion of the world's natural gas resource and offer great potential for future reserve growth and production. However, to meet future global energy demand, access to tight gas reservoirs requires innovative and cost effective technical solutions. 
Yet, tight gas reservoirs are often characterized by complex geological and petrophysical systems as well as heterogeneities at all scales. Exploring and developing tight gas accumulations are both technically and commercially challenging due to the large subsurface uncertainty and low expected ultimate recovery per well. Appraisal of deep tight gas reservoirs offers many challenges, including production rate predictions when wells are drilled overbalanced. Overbalance leads to near wellbore damage to the rock matrix and fractures. Damage to natural fractures intersecting the well can prevent their detection leading to missed productive intervals. 
In addition, the operating environment is very challenging and that affects the decisions for data acquisition. The use of salt-saturated mud systems creates a contrast and uncertainty in the data. Hence, the quality of data acquired is compromised. 
In the 80's hydraulic fracturing of deviated wells was the method of choice for developing tight gas reservoirs worldwide. Although sound in principle, in practice problems were experienced and caused either by poor cleanup due to fluid incompatibility, erosion of surface facilities or early water breakthrough due to fracturing into the water leg. 
In the 90's horizontal drilling became common practice as new drilling technologies developed and proved to be very successful in many tight gas fields. However, conventional drilling operations introduced foreign fluids and solids into the reservoir which lead to several different formations damage mechanisms that prevented the identification of the gas production potential from these wells. 
In the late 90's underbalanced drilling (UBD) was introduced, mainly to avoid the frequent drilling problems associated with total losses into these tight gas reservoirs. However, significant productivity gains were also observed and this became a key driver to apply the same UBD technology in tight gas fields. 
This paper provides a technical overview of the state-of-the-art UBD technology used to develop unconventional tight gas reservoirs. Two real case histories from eastern Jordan and South West Algeria will be presented and discussed. 
Introduction 
The increased demand for more sources of clean energy such as natural gas from unconventional (tight) reservoirs has forced the industry to explore for more challenging tight gas reservoirs.  New production will probably come from more difficult to produce reservoirs. In general it was accepted that static evaluation tools (logging, coring and seismic), that have proven so important for conventional reservoirs, were inadequate to characterize tight gas reservoirs and that a shift to use of dynamic flow data was needed.|","Tight Gas Reservoirs"

The complex properties of the unconventional gas resources pose challenges to petrophysical evaluation techniques and tools. Data from standard logging tools and standard interpretation techniques produce high levels of uncertainties in the analysis, hence, limiting their reliability in producing thorough petrophysical solutions. Both tight and shale gas formations add multiple layers of complexity to the petrophysical evaluation with complex lithology and heterogeneity causing uncertainty in the hydrocarbon volume calculations and hydraulic fracturing completion designs. Without an accurate completions design, it would not be possible to produce at an economic rate or volume from these formations. Therefore, the need for accurate petrophysical and Geomechanical properties is critical for shale gas formations development. 
This paper provides field examples with workflow for identifying the anisotropy, calculating the log derived stress profiles and demonstrating the use of lab and field data for calibrating the log measurement.  The lab measurements include the elastic moduli conversion dynamic (from logs) to static (from laboratory), stiffness tensors utilizing the oriented velocities in addition to rock strength and related parameters. This part includes the use of oriented velocities from the lab to validate and correct the existing tensors' correlations (Annie). Correcting the logging tool's measurement for factors such as the gas content and the acoustic conversion models will also be illustrated. The field data include the integration of the pre-fracturing job or mini fracturing to calibrate the calculated minimum horizontal stress (closure pressure) and post fracture analysis to validate the models. 
The result of these calibrations is a more accurate estimation of the formation stress profiles which improves the completion designs. Once these calibrations are done correctly, more accurate stress profile can be calculated in offset areas where cores or mini-fracturing measurements are unavailable. This paper shows the process for calibrating the log derived stress profile and goes through the components and uncertainty 
Introduction 
When a measurement of a property in a formation is identical in all direction, the formation is termed isotropic. On the other hand, when a property varies depending on the direction of the measurement, it is defined as anisotropic formation. Shale gas formation is known to be anisotropic at different levels which can be intrinsic and stress induced anisotropies. The intrinsic stress is observed at two levels due to bedding and deposition where fine-scale of plate like clay grains are layered horizontally. The macro-bedding of the clay plates seen in its structure; commonly through SEM images as shown in Figure 1.A. The second, at larger level, is due to the clay lamination which can be seen in cores or through image logs and crossed-dipole sonic tool which detect the shear-wave anisotropy. Figure1.B shows one example of shale gas core where the lamination is observed. 
On the other hand, the stress-induced anisotropy is caused by the magnitude difference between the principle stresses resulting in natural fracture and induces fracturing during drilling. Stress induced anisotropy characterization can be done at different stages by core mechanical measurements and results can be verified by borehole image logs analysis where the tensile and shear failures are observed. Borehole breakout and induced fractures are indicative of the maximum and minimum stress direction.|","Shale,  Gas,  Log Derived,  Stress"

The progression of new and remote field development, including arctic and deepwater, inherently increases the volume of cuttings and waste generated from drilling, completion and production operations. The economic and environmental impact of this waste management including transportation, treatment and final disposal is considerable and can be drastically decreased through subsurface cuttings and waste injection. This environmentally friendly disposal solution provides an effective and practical way to minimize associated health, safety and environmental risks by eliminating transportation needs and potential accidents, and therefore reducing the long-term project environmental footprint. 
Nowadays, cuttings injection is considered a proven technology for the final disposal of drilling waste through subsurface injection into an engineered subsurface strata or formation where the injected waste is safely contained for permanent storage. The logistical constrains of transporting large volumes of produced waste to the final disposal site poses many challenges in large-scale field development, where the most cost-effective solution is often to drill a dedicated injector well, process and inject all the produced waste at the single cuttings injection site. 
An application of comprehensive fracture-mapping techniques is a major step in ensuring that the target formation will be suitable to accommodate all waste volume injected. Fracture mapping the waste domain complexities represents valuable information, not only in the overall planning of drilling operations, but in the fundamental and invaluable need to provide sound engineering and assurance for the waste subsurface containment.

Introduction 
The exploration and production (E&P) industry has become more ambitious in searching out new frontiers, with notable successes over the past decade, particularly in offshore and arctic. More than half of all oil and gas reservoirs discovered and major development projects worldwide over past 10 years have been in remote and challenging operating environments, and in many instances, with limited support infrastructure and extraordinary environmental protection commitment in the highly sensitive areas. In fact 20 years ago a significant amount of these reservoirs, particularly deepwater and arctic, were still not proven and, in most cases, were not even on our industry's radar screens. 
It is now estimated that more than 200 new remote offshore and arctic fields will enter production over the next four years in response to the criticality of meeting global energy demands over the next decade. Field development capital expenditures are expected to triple by 2020 with majority of this growth taking place in the Atlantic and Arctic basins - particularly in Angola, Brazil, Russia, Norway, Canada and the US.

In unconventional gas and tight oil plays, knowledge of the in situ rock mechanical profiles of the reservoir interval is critical in planning horizontal well trajectories and landing zones, placement of perforation clusters along the lateral, and optimal hydraulic fracture stimulation design.  In current practice, vertical pilot holes and/or the laterals are logged after drilling, and the sonic and neutron log results are interpreted along with mechanical rock properties measured in the laboratory on core material.  However, coring, logging, and core analyses are expensive and time consuming.  In addition, as they are typically only performed in a few wells that are assumed to be representative, there is considerable uncertainty in extrapolating results across wide areas with known variability in stratigraphy, faults, thicknesses, hydrocarbon saturations, etc. 
This paper reports a method for estimating mechanical rock properties and in situ rock mechanical profiles in every well in a development, based on calibration from initial rock core analyses plus drilling data that is routinely acquired. Wellbore friction analysis was coupled with a torque and drag model to estimate in situ unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and Young's modulus (YM) profiles. The key process steps include:  a) Calculate the weight and wellbore friction force of each element of the drill string from bottom to the surface; b) Adjust the hook load (HL) by subtracting the weight of the hook and entire drill string; c) Iteratively compute the friction coefficient to match calculated and observed HL; d) Estimate downhole weight-on-bit (DWOB) by applying a stand pipe pressure correction to the calculated HL and considering potential sliding and abrasiveness; e) Use a rate of penetration (ROP) model developed for polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) drill bits considering a force balance between a drill bit geometry and formation and a wear function depending upon the formation abrasiveness and bit hydraulics to compute confined compressive strength (CCS). The resulting CCS was correlated to UCS and YM using regression constants obtained from laboratory triaxial test data on whole core. Using examples from horizontal wells in a siltstone play in Alberta, Canada, this manuscript demonstrates a workflow to estimate rock strength from drilling data. The predicted UCS and YM values were compared with log data and potential uncertainties arising out of drilling data are discussed. 
Introduction 
In conventional and unconventional plays alike, a typical way to characterize the subsurface is to make measurements of the formation penetrated by the wellbore with logging tools that are either carried behind the drill bit (logging while drilling) or else run in the well after the drill string is removed (wireline or drill pipe-conveyed logging). Because this adds cost and risk, for unconventional gas or tight oil (UGTO) projects that may have hundreds to even thousands of producers, typically only early appraisal wells plus later, areally scattered wells are designed with extensive logging and laboratory core characterization programs.  The assumption is that lateral variability and local heterogeneties are not great and that these data-rich penetrations sufficiently constrain the reservoir properties in the areas between them.  In UGTO projects, good representations of the in situ stress profile and geomechanical rock properties are required to optimize the well trajectories and landing zones, placement of perforation clusters along the lateral, and hydraulic fracture stimulation design.|","hookload,  drilling, rock,  strength,  unconventional"

As industry leaders seek solutions to the myriad of challenges facing unconventional projects, research and development efforts continue in the area of multistage fracturing design.  These research activities are focused on the identification of novel approaches to hydraulic fracturing (HF) design that can lead to more effective design practices in the future.  
This paper describes emerging technologies within the building blocks of HF design for multi-stage horizontal wells, and proposes how application of these technologies can lay a foundation for the development and evolution of future industry practices. The industry debate on HF design commonly revolves around a perceived need for more powerful software tools that can capture complex fracture geometries. This perspective or position within the broader industry is due in large part to the cloud of microseismic induced events that is oftentimes observed to envelop a treatment area.  Some interpret that these events arise from very complex fracture geometry, and therefore modeling tools with increased specialization are needed.     
Rather than focusing only on the ability of the software to replicate complex fracture geometries, a higher-level and integrated view of HF design is recommended. As shown in Fig. 1, this integrated approach considers the progressive analysis and application of subsurface diagnostics and modeling capabilities, and how they can influence meaningful decisions in the area of HF design. In reality, the capability for HF design is as strong as the weakest of these three components and need not rely solely on modeling capability.|","Tight Oil, Hydraulic Fracturing,  Technology,  Design,  Shale Gas"

The tendency of PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) bits to ball in soft shale formations when drilling with WBM is well documented, especially in deep/high-pressure applications. The capacity of shale to absorb water causes the formation to stick to the bit body and cutting structure compromising drilling efficiency. Balling also clogs the nozzles and junk slots reducing hydraulic effectiveness/cooling leading to accelerated cutter wear and premature bit failure. 
In Saudi Arabia's fields, a typical well requires approximately 1,600-2,200 ft of a 12-in. vertical borehole or 3,000 ft of a 12-in. directional borehole to be drilled through carbonates, shale and claystone lithologies. The middle part of the section is composed of mainly claystone, which is the most problematic zone. In recent wells, bit balling incidents through the claystone interval was reducing average rate of penetration (ROP) to less than 10 ft/hr, and in certain cases forced to pull out of hole (POOH). PDC bits with various hydraulics configurations and non-stick coatings were tested in an attempt to alleviate balling issues. The thin layer eroded before the bit entered the problematic zone, exposing the rough bit body. 
An R&D initiative determined mechanical and electrochemical sticking contributes to bit balling. The investigation revealed a coarse bit body increases surface area and adhesive force. When mud flow stops an electrostatic force can cause clay to stick to the bit surface. Based on these findings a new type nickel-phosphorus electroplating process was implemented that creates a thick/durable coating with an extremely strong chemical bond. 
This paper reviews the investigation process and findings of three case studies in the Saudi Arabian fields. The new anti balling coating was applied to a seven bladed PDC design and run on a powered point-the-bit rotary steerable system. The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) drilled the entire section achieving a field ROP record. Drill bits with the new anti-balling coating were also tested in vertical wells in different gas fields setting new bit performance benchmarks. 
Application Review 
In a large gas field in Saudi Arabia, containing several distinctive sub-fields, a 12 in. hole size section needs to be drilled through a mixed sequence of rocks that are comprised of limestones, dolomites, anhydrites, siltstones and shales. A particularly problematic section of the well occurs through a shale formation that is reactive to hydration. In this section, bit balling, as well as stabilizer balling, is a known occurrence with the water-based mud that is utilized. This causes a drastic reduction in ROP and sometimes bits are pulled prematurely but they are typically in good condition once seen at surface (Fig. 1). Field experience has shown that the cutting structure is partially balled up while drilling, causing the low rates of penetration. 
Use of drilling fluid additives to help reduce the potential risks of bit balling has been investigated and introduced into the application, showing some improvements. The overall drilling performance through this interval, especially the low ROP, is still a major concern for the operator in these wells.|","Deep High Pressure Application, Increased Drilling Efficiency in WBM"

Reservoir surveillance using 4D seismic has become a valuable resource for managing decisions under uncertainty. This paper highlights an integrated workflow to preserve geological consistency while calibrating a reservoir model using 4D seismic and production data. We demonstrate a successful application of this approach on our North Sea chalk reservoir undergoing waterflood, where a number of repeat seismic surveys have been acquired over time and leveraged as a quantitative source of information for describing the spatial distribution of reservoir properties and compaction. This seismic monitoring data has resulted in the ability to better manage the waterflood by providing fluid movement insights and subsequent improvement of infill well placement. To capture geologic variability and ensure model predictability, geostatistical parameterization techniques using multiple-point statistics are used to represent the uncertainty in the reservoir model. Additionally, the workflow employs a rock physics model to generate a synthetic 4D seismic response from flow simulation. Inconsistencies between the predicted and observed 4D differences are used to classify the reservoir model shortcomings. The uncertain geological parameters are updated in an optimization loop through the minimization of a misfit function comprised of both production and 4D seismic misfit formulations. The closed-loop workflow is managed by an in-house computer-assisted history matching tool using a stochastic optimization algorithm. The integrated approach yields improved reservoir management by encouraging multi-disciplinary collaboration between geological, geomechanical, geophysical and reservoir engineering disciplines. 
Introduction 
The use of 4D seismic has proven to be a valuable resource for managing decisions under uncertainty. The task of reservoir history matching is generally an ill-posed problem because there exist as a number of potential parameter combinations that generate similar simulated reservoir pressure and production responses. The fundamental reason this occurs is history matching spatially distributes uncertain geological or dynamic parameters (e.g. porosity, permeability, etc.) using localized well information from production data. The geological parameters in between the wells remain largely uncertain or unknown. To reduce inter-well uncertainty, the spatially more dense 4D seismic data can be used to mitigate the non-uniqueness by reducing the number of acceptable models. 
A fully integrated workflow has been developed to ensure the predictability in our model forecasts by preserving the geologic and seismic consistency. This workflow dynamically couples all elements of the seismic to simulation workflow by using a computer-assisted history matching procedure.|","MULTI POINT STATISTICS,  ROCK PHYSICS MODELING,  FRACTURED RESERVOIR,  4D SEISMIC, SEISMIC HISTORY MATCHING"

Optimization of mature fields in maximizing the hydrocarbon recovery has been a major concern for exploration and production companies including PETRONAS Carigali Sdn. Bhd (PCSB). CC is a brown field, situated in south central region of the DD Province of the Sarawak Basin.Since CC field has marginal reserves, an effort to enhance the production was initiated with the objective of economically boosting the remaining reserves.The proven Low Pressure System (LPS) that is widely implemented across Petronas operating fields has benefited CC in optimizing the production by lowering the existing surface back pressure. However, the challenges faced in implementing the system in CC are platform surface constraintand unmanned-operation-at-night philosophy. 
Through further optimization on the existing LPS design and the estimated production from LPS well candidates, Compact Low Pressure System (CLPS) was born. The smaller package is lighter compared to existing system and has more flexibility and mobility. The separator process can cater up to 4000 bopd with approximately 4.0 MMscf/d of gas disengagement. This package consists of three major equipments compacted in one skid, which are shut down valve (SDV) for emergency purposes, vertical separator (V-100) for liquid storage and flow rate measurement, and transfer pump for pumping back the liquid to the main production line. The total dry weight of this skid is approximately 9.8 tonnes with smaller foot print of 8.3 m2. Preliminary well candidates were chosen mainly based on well status (idle well/string were given higher priority), water cut and sand control equipment in place. Then, a network model was generated using Integrated Production Modeling (IPM) software to simulate several operating scenarios and choose the best candidates. To-date, the additional oil gained from the selected 5 wells is approximately 400-600 bopd. With this achievement, CLPS has shown the capability of improving the production by overcoming the surface back pressure impact and solving space constraint issues for wells located in small wellhead platforms. 
Field Background 
CC field is an offshore oilfield located in East Malaysia which has been producing for 30 years since 1979. The current field watercut is around 40% and total oil production is estimated at 12,000 BOPD. The key challenges in this field is to sustain the production rate to above economic level through various production enhancement inititives including infill drilling. For existing wells, various issues such as high watercut, flow assurance, sand production and sub optimal gas-lift injections in dual-strings has been the main causes of production deferral. Numerous well interventions activities such as gas-lift valve change out for gas-lift optimisation, water shut-off, additional perforations for new zones and well stimulations were planned to maximise oil production.  Due to reservoir pressure decline limited water injection pilot using portable system is also currently on-going with the aim to further maximise oil recovery from the field. In the longer term a full field water injection system is planned.|","Low Pressure System, Compact,  Production Optimization,  CLPS"

For a safe and efficient reservoir development, it is important to understand if, how, when and where faulting and fracturing will occur as a function of reservoir production or stimulation operations, or in case of a dumpflood or an internal blow-out situation. This paper describes 1) the making of a numerical geomechanical model to achieve this understanding, 2) the uncertainty in geomechanical model results, and 3) how the model results were applied in operational decisions for production and on reservoir fluid containment. The case study presented here is one of deep-gas production from stacked thin (few meters) sandstone reservoirs vertically separated by shale layers and laterally cut by steeply-dipping sealing normal faults, with pore pressure differences of several MPa across the faults in many sand-shale and sand-sand juxtapositions. We calculated the effective normal stress (sn) and maximum shear stress (tmax) along the faults and in the country rock as a function of pore  pressure changes documented in the field development plan. The sn - tmax data were compared with fault slip and fracture-opening criteria based on Mohr-Coulomb frictional slip and tensile fracturing laws using fault cohesion, fault-friction-angle, and tensile strength as input. The geomechanical model results indicate that the current operational criterion of a maximum pore pressure difference of 7 MPa across the faults can be increased to 10 MPa without creating shear failure or tensile fracturing. This would lead to greater operational flexibility, cost reduction (less wells), and accelerated yet safe production.  
Introduction 
Reservoir rocks deform when their pore pressure is changed due to hydrocarbon production or because of fluid injection. A pore pressure reduction (depletion) increases the average effective stress on the rock, and leads to compaction (densification) and porosity reduction. A pore pressure increase, on the other hand, decreases the average effective stress on the rock, and leads to a bulk-volume increase (dilation) and to a porosity increase. Because the compacting or dilating reservoir remains connected to the rock around it, there will be deformation, displacements and total stress changes in these rocks too (Teufel et al. 1991, Zoback 2007). These total stress changes in the non-reservoir rock do not ""stop?? at the boundary of the reservoir, but are transmitted to the reservoir as well, interacting with the total stress changes within the reservoir proper. Therefore, pore pressure changes in the reservoir are typically accompanied by changes in the total stress in and around the reservoir. Together, they make up the operation-induced change in effective stress in and around the reservoir, also known as the stress path (Addis et al. 1996, Hettema et al. 2000, Nelson et al. 2006, Sayers and Schutjens 2007, Davison et al. 2013). Particularly strong total stress changes (due to depletion or injection) are expected in fault-bounded reservoir compartments, because of the (often) strong fault-position-controlled lateral variation in operation-induced pore pressure change. Hence, rather than the common ""pancake??-model where the overburden acts like a dead weight (see Figure 1a), in pore pressure compartments.|","depletion,  sureveillance, geomechanics,  faults,  shear failure"

A number of key parameters have been used for defining the efficiency of GTL (Gas-to-Liquids) process. The most commonly used bases are Carbon Efficiency (CE) and Thermal Efficiency (TE). This paper discusses the definition of each of them and the significant developments that have occurred and have been expected on the key focus areas of GTL efficiency improvement. 
Both CE and TE should be maximized to the extent of technically feasibility and economical justification to ensure responsible and sustainable utilization of natural resources. Nowadays, the GTL technology CE and TE are considered drawbacks of the GTL technology and as a consequence considerable efforts are being made by technology developers to reduce the inefficiencies. 
The current generation of the GTL technology has a typical plant wide CE of 70-75 % and a typical plant wide TE of 57-61%. Although GTL efficiency is still low compared to conventional refineries and LNG plants, it has been improved significantly over the last two decades. 
Further improvement can be expected over time as the GTL technology has not gone through the same degree of technological improvement as the conventional system. Advances in GTL technology are projected to increase the efficiency within the next decade as such it would be comparable to conventional refineries and LNG plants that have CE and TE of around 90% and 73% respectively.|","GTL Efficiency"

Source rock reservoirs (SRRs) are found in conventional oil and gas basins. The development of a SRR depends on the geological, geochemistry, petrophysical, and geomechanical parameters, as well as economic constraints in the targeted area. While SRR exploration and appraisal methodologies are fundamentally different from conventional assets, the development stage takes on more similarities to conventionals. However, conceptual differences remain that require technical professionals and managers to alter time-tested approaches. Unconventional SRRs impose significant engineering constraints because reserves are spread across large compartmentalized stacked or layered reservoirs, which are highly heterogeneous and contain wide ranges of mineralogy. This paper is a continuation of the exposition on a holistic approach to shale gas and oil development, which has been developed in detail and encompasses more than 25 years of service company experience in US gas shale plays (Navarette et al. 2013a, 2013b). 
The objective of this work is to provide a guideline for acquiring and applying a better understanding and application of SRR reservoir quality and deliverability insights. The goal is to position geoscientists and engineers to maximize well productivity, improve hydraulic fracturing stimulation effectiveness, and optimize drilling and completion efficiency. This paper identifies critical paths and key technical elements or tasks associated with SRR field development. Previous data (seismic, logs, cuttings, mud logs, extended production tests, and optimized well construction and stimulation practices) acquired in the Screening and Appraisal stages are used. A methodical approach is presented that addresses the following key tasks: 
Categorize critical SRR attributes and key learnings. |Confirm hypotheses tested in the Appraisal stages. |Establish drilling program plans for the best reservoir targets (sweet spots) with well location and lateral orientation. |Maximize the stimulation potential and recovery factor. 
This work provides a proven road map for the evaluation and development of SRRs. Critical paths with the associated key technical elements address and provide a project scope of challenges, which enables a holistic solution to successful unconventional SRR development. 
Introduction 
Currently, organic-rich, fine-grained source rocks are the target of intense exploration and drilling for natural gas. So-called thermogenic shale-gas reservoirs comprise a new and abundant type of unconventional energy resource and are commonly referred to as SRRs. SRRs are characterized as Type 3 petroleum systems that have a much lower permeability and much smaller pore throats compared to conventional petroleum systems (Type 1) or even continuous basin-centered accumulations (Type 2). The remaining unexpelled and unmigrated hydrocarbons that remain in the porosity of the SRR can be produced if sufficient fracture conductivity is induced by hydraulic fracturing. Coalbed methane (CBM), oil sands, and oil SRRs are variations on, and composites of, the three basic petroleum systems end members (Williams 2013).

KOC has undertaken an initiative to generate a regional in situ stress map for 23 Kuwait oil and gas fields using the data from more than 400 wells. Key objectives of this project are to integrate all available well data sources from these fields to derive the in situ stress orientation and also to create an interactive digital stress map supported by sub-surface structural geological data including formation seismic horizons, faults and well markers with the help of visualization software. In this way, the outcome of this project is available as an interactive geomechanical knowledge base which can be viewed at regional scale. 
The results of this project indicate that the maximum principal stress azimuth in Cretaceous formations is consistent with the regional Zagros tectonics and it is more or less uniform N45° (±10°) E direction even across major fault systems. However the sub-salt Jurassic formations exhibit high variability in stress orientation across faults as well as in the vicinity of fracture corridors. In addition to the patterns seen in stress orientation, the geomechanical models from each field exhibited that the Gotnia Salt is mechanically decoupling the highly stressed, strong, Jurassic formations from shallower, relatively lower stressed and weaker Cretaceous formations. It was also found that these stress anomalies in Jurassic formations coincide with associated fault and fracture corridors which appear to be critically stressed. Characterizing critically stressed fractures at the wellbore scale provided an understanding of possible permeable fracture sets that could contribute to gas flow. 
This paper discusses detailed results of the regional stress distribution patterns including innovative criteria developed to manage quality control of stress orientation data, correlation between stress anomalies and structural geological elements in Kuwait and also covers insights developed for exploration and development strategies of deep gas reservoirs in Kuwait. 
Introduction and Objectives 
Mapping of sub-surface structures and in situ reservoir properties have been in practice by explorationists for more than a century. The structural maps and profiles provide understanding of geological history and conditions that are essential for play evaluation. Many conventional oil & gas fields in the world have been explored and developed and many are at a mature state. However, limited data are available to map the present day in situ stresses in these fields, as typical conventional exploration techniques assume theoretical stress estimations based on a regional understanding of tectonic history related to the evolution of a particular field structure. Occasionally, seismic attributes have been used to complement these geological estimates. Consequently, there has been little appreciation of the influence of in situ stresses on exploration and development strategies. More recently, it has been realized that geomechanics plays a key role in various ways from exploration through field development including wellbore stability analysis (for improved drilling experience) to reservoir geomechanical analysis (for optimization of production).|","kuwait,  geomechanics, Regional stress,  stress anomalies,  stress map"

The dual issues of band-limited vertical resolution and nonuniqueness of deterministic inversion results has led to the development of methodologies known as geostatistical, or stochastic, inversion. In these approaches, seismic data are typically inverted directly into a high-resolution geological model. Compared to deterministic inversion, stochastic methods deliver multiple realizations that are consistent with the available well and seismic data. 
The seismic inversion process is inherently nonunique, meaning that there is an unbounded number of elastic property models that fit the seismic data equally well above some threshold misfit. We explore the notion of the equally large number of possible stress states that could be interpreted from same seismic observations. 
We make use of stochastic inversion results to incorporate the impact of subseismic uncertainty in seismic-driven geomechanical models. By taking ultiple realizations from a prestack stochastic inversion--acoustic impedance, Vp/Vs, and density--we generate and feed a series of distributions of elastic constants into a finite element stress simulator. The multiple stress solutions allow us to account for uncertainties in the inversion results that can be ultimately captured in a suite of numerical models to predict a set of possible geomechanical states of a field. Therefore, beyond a unique geomechanical forecast for a field, we can now solve for the range of variability in geomechanically safe operational parameters within the field's development plan. 
Introduction 
Determinisic seismic inversion has become a standard practice in the industry. Conventional deterministic seismic inversion results provide important information about the spatial distribution of reservoir properties between wells (see Bosch et al. 2010; Bailey et al. 2010). Together with well data, deterministic seismic inversion can be used to construct 3D geomechanical models (see Herwanger and Koutabeloulis, 2011; Rodriguez-Herrera et al. 2013; Adachi et al. 2012; Sengupta et al. 2011). For instance, it provides a means to populate the geomechanical models with mechnical properties, which ultimately affects the response of the subsurface to the presence of loading/unloading mechanisms and guides the distribution of stress in the  model. 
Typically, however, deterministic seismic inversion results have limited vertical resolution compared to the scale of the well logs. In addition, the seismic inversion process is inherently nonunique, meaning that there are an infinite number of elastic property models that fit the seismic data. The output of a deterministic inversion is limited to to the input seismic resolution, capturing only a bulk elastic response and with all layering details smeared over the seismic wavelength. At such a level of detail, there can be multiple combinations of layer stacks that generate the same seismic response above some threshold misfit. 
As an alternative, stochastic seismic inversion generates a set of realizations that agree with the bulk seismic response and well data and that can account for uncertainties or non-uniqueness associated with the seismic inversion process. The multiple realizations can be ultimately captured in a suite of geomechanical models fed by the AVO inversion outputs, which in turn can provide insight to the range of possible responses of the reservoir under the prescribed geological conditions. The following sections will explore this idea.|","Seismic Inversion,  Stochastic,  3D Geomechanical models,  Geomechanics"

Abu Dhabi land has a giant gas field consisted of layered carbonate reservoirs. The long term plan of the field has been to produce the reservoirs with the safest maximum depletion. A detailed geomechanical study was undertaken to identify changing field stresses and to understand the possible reservoir rock collapse mechanisms. 
The foundation for any 3D geomechanical modeling is 1D Mechanical Earth Model that includes elastic and strength properties, overburden stress, pore pressure and magnitude and direction of horizontal stresses. The input data for 1D modeling is openhole logs (density and compressional and shear sonic logs). Image data, caliper logs, pore pressure and closure and breakdown pressure measurements are necessary to calibrate the models. To improve quality and reliability of the 1D MEMs, Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) requested lab measurements to calibrate elastic and strength rock properties and decided on pore pressure and stress measurements in one of the upcoming wells. Wireline Formation Tester (WFT) technique was selected to provide pore pressure, as well as closure pressure to calibrate magnitude of minimum horizontal stress directly and breakdown pressure to calibrate magnitude of maximum horizontal stress indirectly. Acquired compressional and shear sonic logs allowed building continues properties, pore pressure and stress profiles. 
Introduction 
3D geomechanical modeling was conducted for the interested reservoirs in the Bab field. The main objective of this study was to investigate possibility of formation rock collapse, particularly within severely depleted areas, and associated well collapse and completion integrity damage. This study also aimed at assessing potential geomechanics-related risks due to early depletion (cap rock integrity and fault sealing capacity). 
Figure 1 shows the general workflow of this study. Firstly, 1D Mechanical Earth Models (MEMs) were constructed using available wireline logs. The measured data was used to calibrate the calculated elastic and strength rock properties, pore pressure and horizontal stress profiles. Drilling reports were analyzed to extract wellbore instability-related events to calibrate the 1D MEMs further. To better capture variation of elastic and strength properties across the reservoir, 1D MEMs were constructed for several wells. Then, a 3D MEM was built based on the static geological model and dynamic reservoir model. 1D MEMs were used to populate the mechanical properties for 3D modeling carried out for the duration of pre-production until present. The results were calibrated against the production data. The calibrated 3D model was then used to perform two-way coupled modeling for future rock behavior in the cap rock and reservoir depletion mechanism.|","wireline formation tester, sonic log,  carbonate formation,  geomechanics"

Drilling of shale has long been a challenge due to the strong sensitivity of shale to drilling fluids. Improper selection of drilling fluid may cause strong shale-fluid interaction and, consequently, wellbore instability. It is critical to design drilling fluids so as to minimize the shale-fluid interaction. 
Shale can possess different behaviors when in contact with fluid (e.g., fracturing, swelling, and dispersion). The differences in shale-fluid interaction are mainly related to its clay minerals, structure, bedding and thin laminae, and pre-existing fractures. The rate and strength of interaction vary for different shales. While strong fracturing or dispersion could happen in just a few minutes for some shales, other shales exhibit only very weak fracturing after days in contact with the same fluid. Confining pressure can significantly reduce the propagation of fractures, but pre-existing fractures can be enlarged or extended due to fluid invasion. 
Due to the variations of shale and the resulting differences in shale-fluid interactions, the shale behavior of fluid in one area or formation cannot always be extrapolated to another area or formation. For a specific shale formation, the understanding of diagenesis, bedding and thin laminae, pre-existing fractures, and abundance and distribution of reactive clays such as smectite, helps predict the potential shale instability. For example, if shale with high smectite content has not experienced substantial compaction and thermal alteration, it may show a strong tendency for dispersion. Alternatively, if high-smectite shale has experienced strong compaction and thermal alteration and shows laminated structures, fracturing along bedding planes or laminae could be the dominant deformation mechanism in fluids. Our laboratory tests indicate that even for highly reactive shale, proper inhibition can be achieved if the composition and concentration of chemical additives in drilling fluids are selected appropriately. 
Introduction 
Drilling of shale has long been a challenge due to its strong potential for wellbore instability, which is mainly caused by the imbalance of in-situ stresses and/or interactions between drilling fluid and shale (Lai 1999; van Oort 2003). The mechanical failure of shale related to stress status can be minimized or prevented by the adjustment of mud weight and changing the drilling trajectory. Nevertheless, chemical interactions have to be minimized through the selection of proper drilling fluid chemistry. 
Wellbore stability is not an issue for most shale formations with oil-based and synthetic-based drilling fluid, or ""mud??. However, high costs and environmental restrictions have largely limited the use of oil-based drilling fluid. For water-based drilling fluid (WBM), the chemical interaction between rock and fluids due to both water and ionic species fluxes from and into the rock could cause wellbore instability. Therefore, design of WBMs with appropriate chemical additives is critical to the success of drilling practices both economically and environmentally (Simpson et al. 1995; Ewy and Morton 2008; Gomez and He 2006, 2012). 
This paper will focus on the chemical interactions between shale and water-based drilling fluids. The paper will first explore the behavior of shale in fluids and investigate the relationship between the interaction behavior and rock properties. Then laboratory test results are presented that indicate shale-fluid interactions are strongly dependent on fluid chemistry. Even for highly reactive shale, appropriate composition and concentration of chemical additives can effectively reduce its interaction with fluids.|","Drilling fluid,  Wellbore stability, Shale-fluid interaction"

Inc.| Dernaika, Moustafa R., Ingrain Inc| Kalam, Zubair, Abu Dhabi Co. Onshore Oil Opn.","|Abstract 
Characterization of carbonate reservoirs is challenging as well as daunting due to the inherent heterogeneities that occur at all scales of observation and measurement. Heterogeneity in carbonates can be attributed to variable lithology, chemistry/mineralogy, pore types, pore connectivity, and sedimentary facies. These complexities can be related to processes controlling original deposition and their subsequent diagenesis. 
Reservoir cores from super giant producing carbonate field in Abu Dhabi have been used in this study. X-ray CT scanning, Thin Sections, porosity, permeability, mercury-derived drainage capillary pressure (Pc) and pore throat size distribution (PTSD) have been used to define the petrophysical groups and different sedimentary facies. The effects of carbonate heterogeneity on reservoir behavior have been studied by correlating rock structure/texture and pore-throat size distribution to formation resistivity factor, cementation exponent (m), and to relative permeability. The effects of wettability and rock nature have been discussed based on the relative permeability trends observed on the main rock types covered in the field. 
Less heterogeneous reservoir rocks with muddy structure and uniform pore throat size distribution (PTSD) have moderate poroperm characteristics and tend to be less tortuous with average cementation exponent m at 1.85. More heterogeneous rocks with grainy/muddy or grainy structures and bimodal/heterogeneous PTSD have very good poroperm characteristics and tend to be more tortuous with range of cementation exponent m values from 2.20 to 2.50. Large variations have been obtained in imbibition relative permeability curves among the different rock types, which were explained on the basis of rock structure, PTSD curves and poroperm characteristics. The more heterogeneous rock types present more oil-wet behavior than the less heterogeneous rock types. 
The full integration of resistivity and phase flow laboratory results with geological heterogeneities showed consistent trends in reservoir characteristics, and offered in-depth understanding of the reservoir rock properties for potential investigations in further field development using IOR/EOR techniques. 
Introduction 
Accurate knowledge of petrophysical properties is required for efficient management and prediction of future performance of oil and gas reservoirs. This knowledge necessitates the understanding of physical properties of the reservoir rocks and the interactions of various fluids with interstitial surfaces, and the distribution of pores and minerals within the porous medium. The quantification of the effect of heterogeneity on electrical petrophysical properties helps reduce uncertainty in the estimations of water saturation from resistivity logs. Furthermore, the evaluation of the effect of heterogeneity on relative permeability helps in the understanding of the reservoir dynamic behavior and fluid distribution in addition to wettability and residual oil saturation after water and/or gas injection. 
Core laboratory data can help establish a sound basis for reservoir modeling and develop effective strategies for reservoir exploitation (secondary and EOR) schemes (Masalmeh and Jing, 2008). However, the full characterization and rock typing of core samples are often overlooked in special core analysis (SCAL) programs. This would lead to unrepresentative selection of the core samples and would raise questions about the effectiveness of the core data in the reservoir model and its calibration.|","SCAL,  Carbonate,  Heterogeneity"

This paper introduces the bases for the design of next-generation automated workflows to implement advanced assisted history-matching (AHM) techniques. The paper presents procedures for geostatistical modeling, high-end dynamic flow simulation modeling, and the use of streamline tracing and visualization to generate a basic (fundamental) model for AHM. The accuracy of the base model is essential because this model is the starting point of the AHM process; therefore, the quality of the AHM process is dependent on the base model. 
The geomodel benefits from a combination of multiple lithotype proportion mapping (LPM) and plurigaussian simulation (PGS), which successfully represents complex, carbonate depositional settings with eight lithofacies and high-permeability channels. By honoring geostatistical variograms and core-log constraints, a reservoir model is generated with 1.4 million cells. The LPM indicated that 108 layers are sufficient to describe the vertical resolution of lithofacies in the reservoir. A three-dimensional (3D), three-phase, black-oil single-porosity numerical simulation model was developed. The dynamic model has three-phase relative permeability normalization that computes the effects of parameterizing rock type and permeability distribution in the static model. The model is complex, as it has 16 equilibrium regions and two pressure volume temperature (PVT) regions. The simulation model includes 49 wells in 5 waterflood patterns to match 50 years of production, 12 years of injection, and 8 years of forecasting. The model was optimized for minimum simulation time. The base case was used for a) closed-loop, multilevel probabilistic history matching with parameterization of geostatistical and reservoir-dynamic properties and b) dynamic model ranking (DMR) and uncertainty quantification based on predicted oil recovery factor (ORF). 
This workflow was implemented at the North Kuwait Integrated Digital Field (KwIDF) collaboration center. It generates faster and more accurate history matching updates, produces a high-resolution reservoir model with no upscaling, and calculates waterflood indicators, including voidage replacement, water injector efficiency, producer well allocations, sweep efficiencies, and recovery factors. 
Introduction 
With the vision to transform the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) through the application of integrated digital oilfield (iDOF) concepts and drive the future KOC operations to the next level of excellence, the operator's senior management endorsed the development of a family of advanced integrated asset management (IAM) workflows, referred to as ""smart flows,?? to optimize and integrate the subsurface models of the major Sabriyah-Mauddud (SaMa) reservoir with well models and network surface systems in various time horizons. The objective is to increase the effectiveness through automating work processes and shortening observation-to-action cycle time. The group of nine first-generation production engineering workflows focuses on production and operational activities and was launched at KwIDF in 2012.

A re-development drilling campaign was planned for a brownfield in South East Asia. In previous campaigns, conducted between 10 and 20 years ago, limited data had been acquired in the shallow to intermediate sections. At the time extensive wellbore stability issues led to stuck pipe events and lost wireline strings. The absence of data from the shallow sections resulted in difficulties for seismic ties and identifying potential shallow hazards. 
The planned development phase involved long 12 <U+00BC> in hole sections from a very shallow depth, with extensive borehole builds from vertical to 68°. In order to acquire shallow hole information, log data requirements led to a long bottom hole drilling assembly including multipole sonic measurements. 
The sonic measurements were acquired using a new multipole sonic tool in an 8 inch collar. Real time quality control using transmitted coherence peaks and pumps off stations gave confidence in the real time compressional data. Post processing of the full recorded mode waveforms confirmed the real time values. For shallower intervals Leaky-P dispersive processing allowed determination of formation compressional signals (differentiating formation and mud where they are close in value). Formation shear values were always slower than the mud and so were not available from the Monopole signal. The Quadrupole mode contained slow shear through the majority of the section. Shear data was seen in the range of 275 - 920 usec/ft. The compressional and shear data is the shallowest borehole sonic data acquired in the field to date. Presence of shallow permeable gas was confirmed by good quality shear sonic data in a highly unconsolidated formation. The sonic data was also used for seismic inversion. Historically acquisition of shallow interval sonic data has been problematic in South East Asia due to soft formations and wellbore stability issues. This paper demonstrates the use of LWD mulitpole sonic to address this challenge to reduce drilling risk and geological uncertainty. 
Introduction 
Sonic measurements have evolved significantly from initial rather simple application for correlating surface seismic sections in the 1950s (Aron et al.,2008). A sonic while drilling tool (LWD) was first introduced in 1995 with Monopole measurements only. Theoretical and laboratory work conducted in the 1980s described the use of quadrupole methods for borehole sonic shear measurements (Winbow, 1985, Schmitt, 1988 and Chen, 1989). More recently, quadrupole sonic LWD tools have been introduced in the industry (Tang et al., 2002, Market et al., 2007, and Kinoshita et al., 2008) to address the need for a continuous shear measurement in applications such as geomechanics, amplitude versus offset (AVO) modeling and other seismic interpretation, and Vp/Vs to detect the presence of gas. 
In offshore South East Asia, the shallow section formations are commonly poorly consolidated and exhibit very slow acoustic properties. Formation shear slowness (DTS) is always slower than the mud slowness in these conditions and is not available from the Monopole signal. The older generation LWD Monopole tools therefore could not detect the shear values in this environment. With borehole conditions deteriorating with time in these poorly consolidated formations, wireline sonic data has been very difficult to obtain. This resulted in limited sonic data  acquired over the shallow section in the past for seismic tie in and shallow gas hazard identification. Therefore there has been a high demand to have an LWD tool which can give good quality continuous compressional and shear slowness in this region.  The measurements are applicable to most of the brownfields in the South East Asia region.|","Quadrupole Sonic LWD,  LWD Sonic Compressional and Shear,  Shallow Gas Hazard,  Unconsolidated Formations"

Downhole operations in the petroleum industry include drilling and completing the well for production. Experiments conducted on different types of lasers have shown the potential of the cutting - edge technology being applied in downhole operations. One of the tests was conducted on MIRACL (Mid Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser) to determine its feasibility for drilling and perforating petroleum wells and another was on COIL (Chemical Oxygen-Iodine Laser) to determine the least specific energy (SE) needed to destroy varying rock types. This paper presents the applications of laser technology in downhole operations such as drilling, perforation, stimulation, vaporizing stuck pipes, tracer detection, treatment of asphaltene deposition and cutting of subsurface equipment such as casings, tubing strings etc. Its benefits are presented in terms of effects on Rate of Penetration (ROP), operational downtime, formation damage, clay treatments, flow enhancement and overall well deliverability. Laser technology has been utilized successfully in the medical industry, manufacturing industry, nuclear industry etc. Therefore, its applications in downhole operations are major strides in the petroleum industry and a means of optimizing downhole operational practices. It has been reported that integrating laser technology with conventional drilling technology will immensely improve drilling efficiency but this has not been so far applied in the field. Conclusions derived from a two year project funded by The Gas Research Institute (now Gas Technology Institute) in 1997 on ""Adapting Star Wars High-Powered Lasers to Drilling Natural Gas Wells,"" are that lasers can cut rock of all lithologies; shear power shares importance in cutting rock with such parameters as wavelength, purge gas pressure and hole size; and historical and widely accepted theoretical calculations of the laser power needed to spall (break), melt and vaporize rock are significantly higher than experimental values. Just like any new technology, laser technology has its challenges and they are highlighted accordingly. 
Introduction 
The most reliable way to detect oil and gas is by drilling an oil well. From the onset, oil wells have been drilled using cable tool (percussive) drilling method. This method of drilling was gradually replaced by rotary drilling in the twentieth century. As Research and Development progresses, laser drilling was developed in the 90&apos;s. An oil well needs to be completed to flow the well. Well completion includes casing, cementing, perforation, stimulation etc. Various studies have been conducted to evaluate the suitability of this breakthrough technology in downhole operations and they have all yielded positive results.|","Well deliverability,  Formation Damage,  Downhole Operations,  Rate of Penetration, Laser Technology"

The efficiency of a sandstone reservoir is a function of the initial depositional parameters (grain-size, sorting and composition) and of the post-depositional evolution during burial. The depositional parameters are closely linked to the sedimentary environment and the post-depositional evolution depends on the paleo-dynamic geological setting that conditions both the burial rates and the temperature history. 
The reservoir quality of sandstone was appraised in the past mostly in a qualitative way either by using close-by cored wells information or by taking into account the log porosity from adjacent wells. In the recent years more quantitative approaches to predictions were developed. The reservoir quality is currently appraised in Eni E&P with two methodologies. The first is proprietary and is based on the Reservoir Efficiency Index© (e-rei), a quantitative indicator of the quality of a clastic reservoir calculated from thin sections on the base of the quantitative petrographic data. A dedicated geostatistical tool (Softkrig) was developed in order to map the e-e-rei values on the base of TWT, depth or temperature driver maps.. The second methodology is based on the use of a reservoir quality modelling software (Touchstone), developed in the frame of an Industrial Consortium and able to predict the mechanical compaction, the quartz cement precipitation and the illite formation and thus to model porosity and permeability. 
The methodologies are complementary and have been applied on Paleozoic African reservoirs. The main factor, reducing reservoir quality, was identified in the cementation by quartz, while the preserving mechanism, increasing reservoir quality, was recognized in the presence of early diagenetic clay coatings. 
The case-study shows the pros and cons of applying the two methodologies. In particular the e-e-rei mapping is recommended for the play fairway analysis of reservoir quality, while Touchstone is more suitable for the sensitivity analysis and for the determination of the porosity/permeability values on a given prospect. 
The two methodologies are limited one by the fact that is deterministic, the other by its ability to model only some of the diagenetic events that take place during burial. In order to overcome these problems, transport-reaction models may be used. A first attempt to apply these models, already used in carbonate diagenesis and reservoir quality prediction, to sandstones showed that there are way forward in applying this methodology. 
Introduction 
The Reservoir Quality Quantitative Prediction (RQQP) of a sandstone reservoir is a fundamental activity aimed at the delivery of maps that may be used for the evaluation at level of play/leads/prospects and, more in general, for the ranking of the different zones of an explorative area/concession. This provides a significant contribution to the explorative activity from basin to prospect scale. 
The reservoir quality of siliciclastic sediment, that will become sandstone, is basically determined by: 
the vertical (thickness) and horizontal (areal) dimension of the sand body; this is directly linked to the energy of the environment of deposition and influences the presence and amount of sand deposited in each point of the basin; |the depositional initial petrographic characteristics (such as grain-size, sorting and the presence of detrital clays in the pore space) and the original composition of the sediment in terms of type of grains (quartz, feldspars, lithic grains); both features are determined by the energy of deposition and, for composition, by the source-area of the sediments;","Reservoir quality,  Sandstones,  Modelling"

This work describes an approach in characterizing fractured reservoir of upper Jurassic Carbonate using seismic azimuthal anisotropy. The ultimate objective of this study was to attempt to map permeability multiplier inter-well for the contribution to the simulation model and the subsequent development plan of an oil field offshore Abu Dhabi. 
The azimuthal seismic anisotropy for fracture prediction method showed fractures that are similar to those indicated by well methods and therefore seismic can be used to detect natural fractures between wells. The confidence in the seismic fracture prediction method's ability to capture information about fracture in Carbonate reservoir has increased if the well data are accurately integrated. 
The study interval exists in the dense zone of the Upper Jurassic reservoir with total thickness of 120'. The fractures evidence have been compiled from well data, such as Core, FMI, orthogonal shear sonic, production test, multi-arm caliber.etc. Present day stress is captured from induced fractures direction, borehole breakout, offset field stress map, Eocene structure map and world stress map. All compiled information's indicated maximum horizontal stress of N10°-30°E direction. 
The four sectored wide azimuth seismic data set have been fitted to an ellipse to find out the fast and slow velocity direction and the difference between those velocities. The Interval Velocity is sensitive to Lithology, porosity, pore fill; the Vint-Slow is sensitive to the minimum horizontal stress. The lower the VINTslow, the less the minimum horizontal stress, which allows the fracture apertures to be more open. 
It is observed that the seismic anisotropy map for fractures showed a dominated direction (NNE-SSW) that match with present day stress field. The azimuthal Vint records current day stress field, not paleo-stress field. Good correlation between well permeability multiplier and the fractures map, particularly at the two reference wells. 
Following the analysis of the azimuthal seismic anisotropy maps such as azimuthal amplitude and interval velocity, a good correlation has been observed between the seismic anisotropy components and the production well test. The two seismic anisotropy components that showed a great deal of link with the computed well permeability multiplier are the computed slow interval velocity and the anisotropy azimuth deviation from the known present day stress. 
Therefore, the following equation has been written to invert those azimuthal seismic components into permeability multiplier. The resulted map showed match at both input wells and one blind well.|","azimuthal anisotropy, permeability multiplier,  Upper Jurassic fractured carbonate,  orthogonal wide azimuth"

Massive mud losses, well logging, seismic data together with observed conformance issues and significant variation in well performance suggest a well developed fracture system in a regional Shuaiba reservoir.  Proper characterization of such fractures plays a critical role in modeling reservoir fluid flow and production. 
Fracture corridors are the dominant fluid flow paths in Shuaiba reservoirs and are the focus of this study. Their spatial distribution and conductivity are characterized by integrated analysis based on drilling, logging, core, seismic, and well performance. Geological analysis, including tectonic/structure history, strain/stress variation, and rock mechanical stratigraphy are performed to better understand the fracture system. 
Overall well performance is clearly related to fracture distribution throughout regional fields. During early stages of production, before water flooding, conductive fracture corridors connected the underlying aquifer to producers and occasionally resulted in premature water breakthrough in high strain areas. Following the implementation of water injection, these fracture corridors also connect some injectors and producers. As a result, continued development requires recognizing and mapping these fracture corridors.  This is done by acquiring saturation data in recent horizontal wells. Together with borehole image data, the width and configuration of fracture corridors can be characterized. 
A practical approach is taken in 3D fracture modeling. Fracture corridors are interpreted in 3D by integrating all static and dynamic data available. Their conductivity is classified into high, mid and low using dynamic data and mud losses. Fracture distribution and flow properties are related to or constrained by geologically more predictable attributes including reservoir curvature, current day stress field, structure pattern, and mechanical stratigraphy. 
Using the approaches described above, an improved characterization of the fracture system was developed and exported to a geologic model for use in a dynamic simulation model to better predict waterflood performance. 
Introduction 
A producing oil field, located offshore Qatar, was discovered and began producing oil in the early 1960s. Shuaiba deposits consist mainly of microporous mudstones and wakestones with a small percentage of grain-dominated rocks localized in shoals along northwestern area of the field. Current Shuaiba oil recovery is relatively low due to low rock matrix permeability, which is complicated by a system of fracture corridors that led to early breakthrough and early well abandonment in some areas of the reservoir. 
Conductive faults and fractures have long been known to be important factors to fluid flow in Middle East Shuaiba Reservoirs. Studies have documented the evidence for fluid flow in conductive faults based on the results of petrophysical logs and well production performance. Of the 16 early Shuaiba wells in the field, three wells produced the majority of the Shuaiba oil. These three wells are located within or in close proximity to mapped fault zones.|","Modeling,  Characterization, Fracture"

Shale has certain characteristic features that make it difficult to evaluate in a traditional laboratory setting. The unique characteristics of shale formations include very low permeability, the existence of microfractures, and sensitivity to contacting fluids. Advances in the testing of shale have remained relatively stagnant.  As a result, current shale fracturing practices and technologies are mainly based on simulation models, and experience from conventional formations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop an experimental setup to measure the hydraulic breakdown pressure for fractures in shale cores , and to use the setup to study the effects of different parameters such as fluid types and characteristics, injection rate, shale bedding, acid injection, and different additives and systems on the breakdown pressure, fracture shape, and fracture direction. 
Cores  from a Mancos Shale outcrop were evaluated in this study. Based on experimental results, breakdown pressures in shale formations have a strong exponential relationship with the fluid viscosity, where increasing fluid viscosity increased the breakdown pressure. In addition, linear relationship was observed between the injection rate of fracture fluids and the breakdown pressure. Even for shale with low HCl solubility (less than 2 wt%), the breakdown pressure of the shale formation was reduced by injection of HCl acid, and a  further increase in  the  acid contact time will reduce the breakdown pressure further. Also, additives designed to improve the flow of fracturing fluid in microfractures tend to reduce the breakdown pressure and enhance fracture complexity. Finally, fracture complexity increases with reduced viscosity and/or increased acidity of the fluid. Nitrogen gases will maximize the fracture complexity. 
Introduction 
Shales are fine-grained sedimentary rocks that can be rich sources of petroleum and natural gas. Over the past decade, the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has allowed access to large volumes of shale gas/oil that were previously uneconomical to produce, Seale (2007). In North America, shale reservoirs such as the Bakken, Barnett, Montney, Haynesville, Marcellus, and most recently the Eagle Ford, Niobrara and Utica shales are drilled horizontally and then completed with multistage fracture stimulation (EERC 2013). These completion techniques may allow more than 30 stages to be pumped into the horizontal section of a single well, Mooney (2011). The production of oil and natural gas from shale formations has rejuvenated the natural gas industry and reversed the oil production decline in the United States. Of the natural gas consumed in the United States in 2009, 87% was produced domestically. Shale gas resource and production estimates increased significantly between the 2010 and 2011 and are likely to increase further in the future, International Energy Outlook (2013). The natural gas resources for gas shale in the USA are estimated to be around 500-1,000 TCF and oil around 25 billion barrels, EIA (2011). 
Shales have certain characteristic features that make them difficult to evaluate in a traditional laboratory setting. The most important characteristics are low permeability, the existence of microfractures, and sensitivity to contacting fluids. Shales consist of minerals of variable composition mixed with organic matter commonly occurring finely dispersed in the matrix, or in thin laminae. Mechanical properties strongly depend on the volume fractions of minerals, kerogen and pore fill. Attempts have been made to relate acoustic velocity, and velocity anisotropy to the degree of kerogen maturity of the shales (Vernik and Nur, 1994; Vernik and Liu, 1997; and Prasad and Mukerji 2003). Prasad et al. (2009) showed that in low-porosity shales, velocity was directly correlated to kerogen content and textural heterogeneity; elastic impedance, velocity, and density increase with increasing shale maturity. Most studies on mechanical properties of shales were achieved using compressional or tensile loads (Jizba, 1991; Brown et al., 2002; Gurevich, 2002; Pham et al. 2005; Tran, 2009; Saenger and Steeb, 2011; and Lin and Lai 2013). Few studies using hydraulic fracturing fluids to break the shale cores have been reported.|","Shale Formation,  fracture complexity,  Break down pressure"

The Drilling Engineering Research Group at the University of Calgary has been seeking better ways of improving drilling operations and decreasing costs by the use of advanced real-time modeling and simulation technologies. It is well known that the performance of a drill bit directly affects the overall drilling performance. The bit performance is often evaluated by the rate of penetration (ROP) which is dependent on the weight on bit (WOB). Therefore, obtaining actual downhole weight on bit (DWOB) is crucial in achieving good performance of a drill bit. 
This paper defines the procedures or steps to measure DWOB and an analytical model for calculating DWOB using typical surface collected drilling data. Field test data is used to initially calibrate the analytical model. The calibrated analytical model is next used in a forward calculation to predict DWOB on the same well. DWOB is also predicted on a second well using the same drilling rig. 
The results from the calibrated model are compared to the DWOB collected by the CoPilot, a Baker Inteq downhole measurement tool. The comparison shows that the DWOBs from the model match those from the CoPilot well. 
The model can be integrated in a new directional Autodriller system, which can in real time set the DWOB from surface measurements. The directional Autodriller can automatically conduct real-time analysis and calculations of DWOB as well as maintaining a precise DWOB for the drill bit. This will improve drilling efficiency and reduce cost. 
Introduction 
A drilling mechanics sub (DMS) was developed to measure DWOB, torque on bit, bending moments, shear force, accelerations and differential pressure [1]. Measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools have increased drilling efficiency in many directional wells. With information provided by downhole weight on bit and torque sensors, more timely and accurate decisions have been made, resulting in lower costs per foot. Specific applications of this technology include bit optimization, directional feedback, and drillstring-friction analysis [2]. The theoretical calculation of DWOB in this paper was done using an analytical torque and drag model [3]. The calculation of the friction coefficient and DWOB was also attempted using finite element analysis FEA [4, 5]. The calculations and analysis in these works have laid a solid foundation for a new type of Autodriller [6]. The future Autodriller will be installed at surface with an operating panel and connected to a powerful computer with high speed and a big memory, which can gather large amounts of real-time drilling data and other necessary information. This paper states the procedures or steps of measuring DWOB. An analytical model for calculating DWOB is introduced herein and some of the field test data is used to initially calibrate the analytical model. Finally, the calibrated model DWOB is compared to the collected downhole DWOB for two wells.|","Real-time, Drilling,  Downhole weight on bit,  model,  Calibration"

Knowledge of the present-day stress field is vital for a range of earth science disciplines, including hydrocarbon and geothermal energy production, mine safety and seismic hazard assessment. The scientific importance of understanding the present-day maximum horizontal stress orientation has been demonstrated by the findings of the World Stress Map (WSM) Project, which has spent over 25 years building an extensive freely-available repository of present-day stress information as a collaborative project between academia, industry and government. The WSM project has revealed that the plate scale present-day stress is controlled by the tectonic forces exerted at tectonic plate boundaries. However, numerous studies in sedimentary basins have shown that stresses in the oil-patch can be complex, and controlled by both major far-field forces (plate boundaries, body forces from mountain belts) and intra-basinal forces, such as detachment zones, salt, faults and basin geometry. 
The World Stress Map project contains free and public information for over 80 basins around the world. However, the project contains almost no wellbore data for the Middle East and Northern Africa, despite this region hosting much of the world&apos;s global oil production and extensive industry activity. To date, the World Stress Map Project only contains limited datasets from petroleum wells in Egypt, Oman and Iran - but no data at all for Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Libya, Algeria, UAE, Kuwait or Qatar. 
In this paper we first review different methods for determining and calculating the present-day stress pattern in the region, then we highlight the lessons learned from the World Stress Map project on the controls of present-day stress in the oil-patch. Finally, we focus in detail on the stress data that currently exists for the Middle East and Northern Africa. 
Introduction 
Knowledge of the crustal present-day stress pattern is important for a range of earth science disciplines including: 
Geodynamic applications (e.g. Richardson 1992; Zoback 1992); |Neotectonic and intraplate deformation (e.g. Tingay et al. 2005; King et al. 2010); |Geomechanical characterization of petroleum basins (Tingay et al. 2005); |Earthquake hazards (Sandiford et al. 2004), and; |Rock mechanics and engineering (e.g. Reinecker et al. 2006; Zang et al. 2012). 
The Present-day stress has numerous applications in petroleum basins, particularly in borehole stability, reservoir drainage and flooding patterns, pore pressure prediction, fluid flow in naturally-fractured reservoirs, hydraulic fracture stimulation, seal breach by fault reactivation and any geomechanical modeling. Hence, present-day stress analysis, as a part of petroleum geomechanics&apos;, has received extensive attention in petroleum industry in recent years (Barton et al., 1995; Sibson, 1996; Jones and Hillis, 2003; Rajabi et al., 2010; Tingay et al., 2010a and b).|","Middle East,  Northern Africa, Present-Day Stress,  Petroleum Geomechanics,  World Stress Map"

Wireline straddle packer microfrac tests have become an important technology in creating microfractures to measure in-situ formation breakdown pressure, fracture re-opening pressure, fracture closure pressure and stress contrast between reservoir and non-reservoir intervals. The formation tensile strength can also be estimated from the difference between breakdown and re-opening downhole pressures. 
This case study describes the use of microfrac tests measurements to validate and calibrate the horizontal stress profile in various intervals of the carbonate reservoir. 
Well-injection plans, cap-rock integrity assessment, shale reservoir fracture containment, stress contrast and minimum and maximum horizontal stress estimations can all be quantified from microfrac test measurement. 
Six straddle packer stations were tested for microfracturing in this study well. One microfrac test was repeated in one formation due to observed poroelastic effects in the fracture re-opening pressure responses. Poroelastic effects around the borehole occur when the pore pressure near the borehole increases with the injection cycles, thereby making it more difficult to effectively re-open the pre-existing induced fracture. When poroelastic effects are evident, it is important and recommended to record the first pressure fall-off cycle after the formation breakdown for fracture-closure identification. Subsequent cycles will indicate higher fracture closure pressures and therefore overestimate the minimum horizontal stress in the interval. 
This paper describes the pre-job modeling, real-time monitoring and post-job interpretation of straddle packer microfrac testing for recalibration of the geomechanical model to provide continuous logs of in-situ horizontal stress profiles over the entire interval. 
Introduction 
The well described in this field was drilled in a carbonate reservoir field. It is a new field that is located approximately 260 km south of Abu Dhabi city, and about 80 km southeast of ASAB field. Figure 1 shows the map of this field and the approximate well location. The shallow interval of this field consists of organic rich carbonates because it is in a basinal setting [1], while the deeper formation is the main oil production formation in onshore Abu Dhabi [2]. 
The objective of the microfrac testing was to measure the fracture initiation, propagation, reopening, and closure pressure in various intervals of the carbonate reservoir to validate and calibrate the horizontal stress profile to aid in the study of stress-field anisotropy, the impact of the stress-field on productivity and cap-rock integrity. 
The microfrac testing procedure includes formation breakdown, fracture propagation, two fracture reopening cycles, and three pressure fall-off for fracture closure identification. Fracture closure was observed by natural leak-off pressure decline behavior and no flow-back was required to induce fracture closure. Borehole quality is an important factor to consider during the positioning of the wireline straddle packer. The sealing capacity of the inflatable elements against the formation can be compromised by borehole washouts and extensive breakouts [3].

A close coupling of geoscience and engineering disciplines has generated a history-matched model for the Dukhan Arab C reservoir serving as a platform for testing of forward development strategies.  The Arab C reservoir is a heterogeneous organization of limestone and dolomite lithologies deposited on a shallow water Jurassic ramp system.  Hydraulically, the 80 ft thick interval represents a network of grainstone conductors compartmentalized by muddy carbonate baffles resulting in layer-constrained dynamic behavior.  The reservoir has been under development for over sixty years, with an early period of natural depletion followed by peripheral water injection utilizing hundreds of vertical and horizontal producers and injectors. 
As part of an effort to update the field development plan, a new geologic model was developed that formed the basis for reservoir simulation studies and depletion planning.  Initially, a series of tests were conducted to determine the sensitivity of model responses to input variables, and these tests helped to guide subsequent static model adjustments.  Horizontal permeability defines aquifer response, waterflood front advance and early pressure trend, while vertical permeability significantly controls subsequent dynamic behavior.  Thin mudstone baffles are common at parasequence boundaries and their continuity and association with stylolites determines inter-zonal vertical communication.  Variable salinity of injected water was shown to have a large impact on water encroachment patterns and derivation of appropriate relative permeability functions improved the calibration of the full-field dynamic reservoir simulation model.  Knowledge of the controlling parameters ranked according to dynamic sensitivity facilitated an emphasis on regional variations constrained by geological trends and helped to minimize the requirement for localized adjustments.  
Lessons learned as a result of this geoscience-engineering feedback can expedite future model building by focusing technical expertise on the most critical parameters controlling fluid flow. 
Introduction 
The Qatar Petroleum-operated Dukhan Field is located onshore Qatar, approximately 80 km west of Doha (Figure 1).  The Arab C reservoir interval is a carbonate anticlinal structure lying 5500-7000 ft below the surface and is approximately 70 km long by 8 km wide.  The Arab C interval is about 80 ft thick with moderate to high reservoir quality (typically 18 % porosity, 100 mD permeability).  A high degree of vertical heterogeneity relates to a sedimentary origin in a near-shore shallow ramp environment featuring high-order depositional cyclicity.  Lateral ranges of 1-4 km for baffling thin-beds supports a localized layer-constrained dynamic behavior, though communication pathways are impacted by sporadic occurrences of cross-cutting conductive and resistive faults.  Arab C production development began in 1949 with a period of natural depletion followed by conversion to water drive in the 1960s via peripheral water injection utilizing hundreds of vertical and horizontal producers and injectors.|","Sensitivity,  Dynamic,  Parameter,  Static, Simulation"

To optimize the areal and vertical sweep efficiency in a fractured carbonate reservoir of Abu Dhabi, 3D coupled reservoir geomechanical modelling is carried out, investigating the impact of natural fractures on reservoir deformation and performance in future production. In this study, AntTracking, Neural Network and fracture simulation techniques were used to model natural fracture networks by integrating FMI image logs, petrophysical and seismic data. The seismic data were smoothed to improve signal-noise ratio by removing noise. Based on smoothed seismic cube, variance processing was performed to enhance the edge effect, followed by AntTracking processing to enhance the discontinuity. SDPs (Seismic Discontinuous Planes) were extracted from AntTracking for the carbonate reservoirs representing fractures including faults and joints. 
The extracted fractures were validated against FMI interpretations of 11 wells in terms of orientation and intensity. To further validate the developed fracture model, the identified fracture sets were calibrated against the geological structures in the field, such as the main anticline and major faults. Four fracture groups were identified. Three groups of fractures were created in an early tectonic event associated with Oman stress, during which the main folding structure was generated, including (a) NW-SE trending related to R shear, (b) NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW trending related to R' shear, and (c) WWS-EEN and WWN-EES related to P shear. Another fracture group identified from AntTracking volume is NE-SW trending, which was possibly associated with the same early event associated with folding and/or due to Zagros stress forming later tensile fractures. 
The fracture model was incorporated in 3D coupled geomechanics simulations and the impact of the presence of the natural fracture networks on the in-situ stress state, bulk Young's modulus, bulk permeability and wellbore stability were investigated. It is concluded that highly deformable zones of the upper and middle reservoirs are generally clustered in NE-SW (maximum horizontal stress) direction. Better productivity is expected to place horizontal wells in this direction. The deformability of the lower reservoir is very different from the shallow reservoirs and has high deformable corridors oriented in NW-SE (minimum horizontal stress) direction. Better productivity is expected to place horizontal wells in this direction. 
In addition to productivity, the results also suggest that drilling horizontal wells needs to consider the presence of fractures and stress direction. It is recommended to drill horizontal wells towards the minimum horizontal stress direction. Drilling in this direction is more stable and less wellbore failure is expected.

Introduction 
The studied field is located in South-East of Abu Dhabi. The production in this field is within Lower Cretaceous carbonate formations, including the upper, middle and lower reservoirs. Those three reservoirs have a very similar structural framework. They are elongated NE-SW trending anticline, with several domal hubs that form saddles in between. The whole structure has been affected by the Tertiary tilt to the NE direction. Repeated structural reactivation of basement has played a key role in present day trap development. Hydrocarbons discovered to date in Abu Dhabi are trapped in structure grown mostly during the Late Cretaceous associated with Oman stress (Sirat et al., 2012 a&b). This gently folded carbonate field is characterized by the presence of two major seismic faults: The N75W and the N45W, and few other subseismic fracture sets. These conjugate-like appearance seismic faults are regularly spaced and are segmented both vertically and laterally forming several compartments (Sirat, 2013a).|","Sweep efficiency,  Fracture permeability, Natural fractures,  Geomechanical modelling,  Abu Dhabi"

We present an exploratory case study of the oil and gas field located onshore within the Gotnia sub-basin located in northwestern Kuwait (Fig-1). Main objectives of this study include: to delineate the Kra Al-Maru and Riksah structure, to establish fault network, to assess fractured reservoir in its entirety, to achieve optimal depth conversion, to identify and assess critical inputs for fracture modeling and to provide key inputs for geo-modeling, all which lead to describing the location. 
Structurally, the area is characterized by four main fault systems. Most of them have subtle seismic signatures on vertical sections as observed on poststack 3D seismic data. The dominant trends in the region are oriented NS and NNE-SSW where the unique. Kra Al- Maru structure is oriented NW-SE, which delimits the main structural high; however, dominant structural trends observed in sets of wells show NS, NNE-SSW trends. The second fracture set observed in the wells is oriented NE-SW, marked by minor vertical throws. The third and fourth fracture sets are oriented WNW-ESE, NW-SE characterized by no fault throws. Observations from core studies also support results achieved in this study. 
Riksah structure is a well-defined four-way-closure anticline and appears to be a reasonable areal entrapment of about 33 km2. Its prospectivity is dictated by fracture potential of the reservoir. It is separated by a saddle like feature from Kra Al-Maru structure located to the west of this culmination. 
The study indicates that the actual orientation of the structure, has most likely undergone fault block reorientation, fault reactivation and relative movement and accentuated folding due to compression effect. The increased stress on the flanks of the structure and the local tectonics are responsible for rotation of structure, which contributed to the evolution of the Kra Al-Maru structure and the orthogonally oriented Riksah structure as indicated by our study. The structural analysis indicates that all major open fractures align NNE-SSW. 
The Riksah structure is a well defined four-way-closure anticline; however, the prospectivity is dictated by fracture potential of the reservoir. The evaluation of the fracture potential of the reservoir is best served by the azimuthally (AVOAz) processed 3D seismic data integrated with well observations. However, in the absence of AVOAz data, the study is supported by integration of well observations and key seismic attributes. The seismic attributes are, edge detection/enhanced seismic attributes, combined with prestack seismic inversion attributes like the Poisson's ratio which is governed by established relationships at wells.|","VARIANCE, FRACTURES,  ANT TRACK,  PARTIAL STACKS"

Core samples from 10 wells in Lower Cretaceous limestones of the Upper Shu'aiba Formation were characterized by conventional core analyses, petrography, bulk chemical analyses, and mercury injection capillary pressure data to define reservoir rock types (RRT) for input to reservoir modeling. Initial grouping by lithofacies allows linkage of rock types to a 3D geological model, but results in RRT with high degrees of overlap in petrophysical properties. When diagenesis is included, however, in the form of porosity cut-offs added to the lithofacies criteria, RRT can be defined having both 3D geological significance and distinct ranges of pore-throat size distribution. 
The use of total porosity as a rock typing criterion is based on the interpretation that porosity is controlled on reservoir scale by depositional clay content of the local stratigraphic environment. The seaward and uppermost parts of the clinoforms have low clay and thus highest porosity. Although most of the pore space is microporosity, higher total porosity corresponds with higher proportions of macropores and probably also with greater frequency of open fractures, resulting in better permeability. High-porosity samples also have several systematic positive differences in MICP characteristics from lower-porosity samples of the same lithofacies. 
Because both lithofacies and porosity are related to the sedimentological and stratigraphic organization of the Upper Shu'aiba clinoforms, the RRT defined by these criteria can potentially be implemented in a reservoir model for assigning particular ranges of petrophysical properties to distinct portions of each clinoform. By this procedure, seven RRT have been defined in the present selection of samples.|","Cretaceous,  diagenesis,  reservoir rock typing, carbonate"

PetroChina","|Abstract 
Classic hydraulic fracturing analysis is based on tensile strength of rock, failure criteria of fracture mechanics or Mohr-Coulomb criteria. The existing hydraulic fracturing theories consider little of permeability of fracture reservoir and effective fracturing range, which is exactly the purpose of fracturing. On the other hand, when evaluating effect of massive hydraulic fracturing (MHF), there may be lots of fracture initiation points and cracks due to large range of MHF, which brings huge challenges to numerical calculation of hydraulic fracturing. 
MHF will have an effect on a large range of reservoir and accompany in-line micro-earthquakes, which indicate that lots of hydraulic fractures of different scales and directions are generated. Therefore, there will be difficulties to analyze cracking and propagating and estimate geometrical parameters by tensile criteria or fracture criteria. Even if the classic method is feasible, processing of element grid after rock failures will be a problem. 
Aguilera (1995) considered shear failure criteria as failure criteria of rocks and proposes fracturing theory of divergent or branched cracks, and that explains the generation of in-line micro-earthquakes in hydraulic fracturing. But the present analysis is just a qualitative method but not quantitative method. 
In fact, the basic goal of hydraulic fracturing is enhancing permeability of reservoirs as large as possible rather than producing one or two fractures. Analysis of fracturing effects is analyzing the influence of effective fracturing range on reservoir permeability. While the existing hydraulic fracturing theories just consider propagations and fracture initiations of one or two cracks but little of the quantitative estimation for effective fracturing range. 
Hence it is necessary to find a better mechanical method to make up deficiencies of the existing fracturing analysis and overcome the difficulties of processing element grid after rock failures. 
This study introduces continuum damage mechanics (Gurson damage model) to hydraulic fracturing, analyzes theories and techniques of hydraulic fracturing of porous reservoirs in terms of continuum damage mechanics and discusses damage effects of hydraulic fracturing to reservoirs. An analysis evaluation system of hydraulic fracturing continuum mechanics is set up, and by using damage theories, a method of analyzing hydraulic fracturing in fissured porous reservoirs is discussed. 
Introduction 
Hydraulic fracturing theories are divided into two schools (Aguilera, 1995): The conventional school believes that hydraulic fractures are perpendicular to minimum principal stress and the prior research is the discussion of one or two fractures' initiations and propagations near wellbore. Three problems mainly solved are (Gidly, 1995; Economides, 2000; Wang and Zhang, 1998): fracture criteria, the direction of fracture propagation and the geometry of hydraulic fractures. Fracture criteria includes tensile strength criteria and fracture mechanics criteria.|","fractures, damage,  hydraulic fracturing"

This paper argues that any carbon dioxide (CO2) capacity-estimation method requires a combination of geological, engineering, and economic analyses to provide rigorous capacity estimates. It also argues that the classification of capacity estimates should follow concepts in the existing SPE Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS) (SPE 2007) as closely as possible. The paper takes the discussion of CO2-storage capacity significantly further. It also aligns storage-capacity definitions more closely to the widely accepted PRMS. Numerous authors and organizations have proposed CO2-capacity classification and calculation systems. In most of them, there is a definition of CO2-storage capacity that is intended to parallel the definition of petroleum reservesnamely, the volume of hydrocarbons that can be commercially recovered from known accumulations from a given date. However, each of the proposed systems applies economics only at the highest classifications of their systems. This is attributed to the infancy of the carbon-capture-and-storage (CCS) industry and/or the lack of a carbon price. However, in this paper, we demonstrate how economics combined with analytical and numerical injectivity modeling on the basis of geological models of the subsurface can help determine practical storage capacity. In doing this, the paper makes observations about methods for estimating storage capacity, shows results of reservoir simulations and economic analyses, draws on SPE and internationally accepted methodologies and definitions of petroleum resources, and discusses how equivalent definitions can be applied to storage capacity. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for an improved CO2-storage-capacity classification system.|","CO2 injection, CO2 injection engineering, CO2 injection economics, CO2 storage, CO2 capacity estimation"

At last, almost everyone is talking about increasing recovery factors, and improved oil recovery (IOR) and EOR are being considered natural components of reservoir management. Furthermore, many traditional philosophies are being openly challenged. EOR planning is happening as part of field-development plans. Proven technologies are being adapted in new, smart ways, and new technologies are constantly evolving from research to commercial applications, making EOR projects more economical. |These new directions are the result of the following factors: |Most fields, including the giant ones, are maturing, and producing liquid hydrocarbons is becoming more difficult in all types of reservoirs (conventional and unconventional). |Leaving approximately 70% of the in-place reserves unrecovered has been challenged. |There have been developments on many fronts (e.g., advanced reservoir characterization, multiphase-flow physics, smart-well and intelligent completions, recovery research, monitoring and control technologies, EOR chemicals, EOR pilot concepts, and observation-well concepts); the collective effect of all of those is going to make new EOR projects more successful. |Increasing recovery factors has been considered a fully integrated multidomain activity (from pore space to separator and everything in between). |Severe production decline in tight/light (unconventional) reservoirs is making the industry think about recovery challenges. |EOR has been considered during field-development planning in most recent offshore oil developments. |We lived through the most active period of EORbetween the mid-1970s and the mid-1980sand learned about recovery fundamentals then. However, if we look back at that era carefully, most of the wells were single and vertical; reservoir characterization was very elementary, with no digital geological modeling capabilities; and there were no concepts such as monitoring systems or intelligent completions. All of those factors created a significant gap between what was planned in the EOR laboratory and what was achieved in field application. Other than those implemented in extremely viscous oils (heavy-oil EOR operations), projects recovered far less than planned. Overall, such recovery gave a stigma to EOR as inherently difficult and expensive. Most of the factors that made EOR difficult and expensive are gone today. That is why we will see more fields using EOR operations in upcoming years. |Broadening the scope of recovery challenge to all domains will make realizations of new reserves more likely, but this change will bring additional challenges. |Recommended additional reading at OnePetro: www.onepetro.org. |SPE 162701 Geomechanics Considerations in Enhanced Oil Recovery by Tadesse Weldu Teklu, Colorado School of Mines, et al. |SPE 166597 BP North Sea Miscible Gas Injection Projects Review by Pinggang Zhang, BP, et al. |IPTC 17157 The Development of a Workflow To Improve Predictive Capability of Low-Salinity Response by B.M.J.M.

In order for a shale development to succeed in countries outside the U.S. and Canada, change management must occur in many areas. Three major challenges will be discussed in this paper: 1) National, regional, and local governments must establish tax and energy policies that encourage development while protecting health, safety, and the environment as well as providing a regulatory framework; 2) the shale resource meeting minimum criteria to meet economic development standards quickly; and 3) a sustained production delivering long-term economic viability. |The first challenge includes the following | Establishing simplified government regulations  to generate the energy company desire to develop and to satisfy peoples health, safety, environment and jobs requirements.

Pointing at the stress concentration and relaxation induced by the internal defects of rocks. Then the integral expression parsing of surrounding rock was derived. The time effect of stress and deformation of surrounding rock was divided into unloading and stress relaxation stage, the approximate analytic expression of stress and deformation of surrounding rock was found out by successive approximation method.

Analytical results show that the local excess tensile stress concentrations in surrounding rocks appear during and after the process of unloading, and the deformation have an additional increase after unloading.
1 INTRODUCTION
The state of stress and strain of underground engineering is an important basis in engineering design, so it has a very practical significance to understand of such a state. Although it often needs to make some idealized assumptions in theoretical analysis, which has a certain distance with the actual situation, the theoretical analysis has an irreplaceable role in providing the understanding of the nature of the researched problems, insight into the role of relevant parameters in the problems, as well as a numerical solution of the reference value (Cai 2001).
The traditional equation for analysis of stress and strain is based on the assumption of continuous and homogeneous. The underground engineering is usually simplified as the plane strain problem of circular section tunnel in isotropic infinite homogeneous medium.
Different researchers analysis the state of stress and strain of underground engineering using different material models and strength criterion, with the considering of the plastic flow rule, which has achieved fruitful results (Browne et al. 1983, Sharan 2005 & 2008, Rodionov & Sizov 1988, Park & Kim 2006, Lee & Pietruszczak 2008).|","Document Type

Especially in recent years, landslide disasters happened frequently on the high-steep slope that emerged from the deep mining of open pit mine due to the high pressure, which greatly influences the normal production and threatens the safety of workers. Aimed at the frequently happened phenomena of slope rock mass deformation and failure in Nanfen Open-pit Iron Mine, the artificial mechanical excavation test is carried out on the bottom bench of the high and steep slope with a height of 700 m, and the in situ real-time monitoring of deep mechanics is proceeded with the remote monitoring and warning system of sliding force, so as to intensively study the law of cracking deformation and failure of slope rock mass under the condition of high pressure. The test results show that under the influence of high pressure environment and ground excavation disturbance, local shallow pull-type failure mostly occurs at the bedding rock slope, and the sliding deformation area runs through the whole slope surface with a vertical height of about 12m. During the failure process, while the cracks generate, expand, run through the slope and the slope or become instability, the monitoring curve of sliding force can issue warning messages in advance, which can effectively avoid serious security accidents caused by landslide and crack disasters and has great theoretical and practical significance for prevention and control of mine landslide disasters.
1 INTRODUCTION
Rock landslide is a kind of landslide composed of various intact rock after the Tertiary. Bedding rock landslide is the most common in rock landslide, the volume of landslide is large, and the hazard is comparatively serious (Wang et al. 2004, Zhou et al. 2006).
In recent years, the vertical height of the open-pit slope is increasing with shifting the mining method of open-pit from hillside mining to hollow mining. The deformation and failure mode of the slope is closely related to regional geological structure features and rock structural characteristics, and its stability is severely affected by rock lithology, joint fissure and blasting vibration (Qiao & Li 2004). Especially the blasting vibration of open-pit production and rainfall are important factors for the stability of mine slope. The harm from production blasting vibration is an indirect damage, especially for jointed slope and high steep rock slope containing faults or fracture zone sand it is mainly caused by seismic waves generated in the blasting (Li et al. 2006).|","Document Type

1 INTRODUCTION
Deep geological repository of high-level radioactive wastes is one of the most promising options to isolate wastes from the human environment. High-Level radioactive Waste (HLW) produces heat due to the continuous decay of radionuclide. Thus the geological disposal of HLW will impose a temperature increase upon the surrounding rock. Argillaceous rocks have a lower heat conductivity compared to granite or salt resulting in higher temperatures around the waste canister for a given heat loading. Moreover, the rock reacts sensitive to high temperatures. The increasing temperature will also influence the pore water pressure and might induce deformation of the rock, which again changes the pore water pressure.
Various in-situ heating tests (Gen et al. 2007) have been performed involving the observation of the response of natural sedimentary clay. For instance, in the Hades laboratory the following experiments have been performed: the CACTUS test (Picard et al. 1994), the ATLAS test and the CERBERUS test (Bernier & Neerdael 1996, Bruyn & Labat 2002).
A comprehensive understanding of coupled thermal, hydraulic and geo-mechanical processes (THM) will be a key element for the design of deep geologic repositories. Therefore, based on a self-developed numerical code, i.e. a 3D Elasto-Plastic Cellular Automaton (EPCN3D) (Pan et al. 2009a, 2009b), this paper presents a numerical study on the coupled THM processes in Opalinus clay in HE-D test.|","Document Type

1 INTRODUCTION
The deep geological disposal for High-Level radioactive Waste (HLW) has been considered as an urgent worldwide environment issue. China pays more and more attentions to nuclear waste with the development of great economical growth. The long-term and reliable insulation from the human environment has raised worldwide attention for the countries who build nuclear power stations. Safe disposal of high level radioactive waste is a challenging task facing the scientific and technological world (Wang et al. 2006a). In order to safely dispose of the high-level radioactive waste generated from the nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities, a number of disposal concepts have been developed in many countries, and results show that the deep geological disposal of High-Level radioactive Waste (HLW) is considered worldwide as the most safe and feasible method to protect human being and environment for tens of thousands years (Zhang et al. 2006). The behavior of HLW repository is determined, to a large extent, by the characteristics of the design and construction of the engineered barriers and especially by the changes that may occur in the mechanical, hydraulic, and geochemical properties as a result of the combined effects of heat generated by the radioactive decay and of the water and solutes supplied the surrounding rock (Villar et al. 2012). The concept design of repository in different geological formations generally relies on a multi-barrier system, which typically comprises the natural geological barriers provided by the repository host rock and an engineered barrier system (Liu & Wen 2003; Wang 2010).|","Document Type

1 INTRODUCTION
The large-scale and complicated rock structure is an important component of hydropower engineering and underground engineering around the world. The stability of rock structure is crucial to the safety of these projects. Excavation and reservoir impoundment for dam, slope and underground structure have an intense disturbance on natural evolution of geologic body leading to the serious stability problem of rock structure and threatening the safety of engineering (Huang 2005).
The time-dependent deformation and damage are the important factors in evaluating long-term stability of rock structure. The intense disturbance deviates the geologic body in critical stability from equilibrium state to non-equilibrium state. And then, the geologic body evolving from non-equilibrium state to equilibrium state would result in time-dependent deformation and damage of rock mass. The sustaining damage and creep will generate a large inhomogeneous deformation affecting the stability of the structure. With dynamic viewpoint, these stability problems can come down to the non-equilibrium evolution problem of the disturbed rock mass and structure. Stability or instability is only the intermediate state or final result of structure evolution.|","Document Type

It is assumed, that the macroscopic failure of the rock is the result of the coalescence of many small micro-cracks at the grain size level. The damage process was modeled and macroscopic fracture pattern of the rock specimens were studied through numerical modeling.

1 INTRODUCTION
The long term stability of geotechnical structures such as tunnels, mining shafts etc. has long been an important issue for safety considerations. As rock is the main load-bearing material in such structures, the lifetime (time to failure) of rock under load is of great practical interest for engineers and researchers. Time dependent behavior of rock has been studied by many researchers (Kemeny 1991, 2003,2005, Sun & Hu 1997, Eberhardt 1998, Shao et al. 1999, Malan 1999, 2002, Aubertin et al. 2000, Masuda 2001, Miura et al. 2003, Chen et al. 2004, Chandler 2004, Shin et al. 2005, Amitrano & Helmstetter 2006, Lei et al. 2006, Jeong et al. 2007, Li et al. 2008, Damjanac & Fairhurst 2010, Jiang et al. 2012, Lu et al. 2014). Konietzky et al. (2009) proposed a lifetime prediction approach for brittle rocks under constant load. Numerical calculations were performed to simulate the time-dependent propagation and coalescence of microcracks, which finally lead to the failure of the rock. As a further development of this research work, this study improved the existing approach by introducing new crack propagation mode and stress intensity factor calculation scheme. The proposed scheme is studied through numerical simulations.|","Document Type

Based on the equivalent continuum and the compound material mechanics, the layered rock mass is treated as an anisotropic elastic medium. Then, the failure modes of slopes with layered rocks have been studied by numerical simulation using COMSOL software. Numerical results show that the damage zone of the slope first increases then decreases with the increase of layered structural plane angle <U+03B8>. When <U+03B8> = 30°, the slope is most easily to destroy. Moreover, the proposed numerical method is applied in Sijiaying iron mine and the results are in good agreement with the actual failure. The successful application shows that the proposed method is reasonable and feasible for the simulation of failure modes of such layered rock slopes.
1 INTRODUCTION
Layered rock slope failure is a vital problem in the geotechnical engineering, and the research for layered rock slope failure mode is a major issue of realistic significance (Xian 1989). Many methods are used to understand the failure of slopes, each one having its own merits as well as limitations.
The stability of large rock slopes, which are susceptible to rock mass failures, can be analyzed by traditional limit equilibrium methods (Bishop 1955, Janbu 1954) based on assumptions regarding the inclination and location of the interstice forces. For many cases, the limit equilibrium methods have proven to give convincing results despite its limitations. However, to identify failure modes of slopes using the traditional limit equilibrium methods, a range of specified slip surfaces need to be given to simulate the safety factor and the minimum will be recognized as the final slip surface (Baker 1980). This method is not convenient and accurate for rock slope engineering due to the heavy work and randomness in choosing slip surfaces.
The conventional numerical modeling has been developed and has become increasingly popular for complex slope stability analysis. Application of numerical simulation is increasing due to many advantages over limit equilibrium method. A number of landslide studies have been carried out using numerical simulation (Singh et al. 2008, Kripamoy et al. 2012). However, these studies have been done always based on that rock mass per se is still simply treated as isotropic material.|","Document Type

Z., Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan| Su, F. S., Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan","|ABSTRACT: A general framework for probabilistic damage in rock using maximum entropy theory is proposed to describe the failure process of marble from hydropower station at Jinping II, China. In this paper, the failure process of marble is divided into three stages. In the first stage, a parameter D0 is employed to describe the compaction of rock before elastic period which can be calculated by maximum entropy theory. In the second stage, elastic theory is used to express no damage in the rock. In the last stage, a parameter D is performed to define and calculate the damage of rock based on maximum entropy theory. The proposed model is used to simulate the failure process of marble under uniaxial compression. The simulated result is well agreement with experimental data, validating the proposed computational framework.
1 INTRODUCTION
The failure process of rock generally experiences compaction, elastic, pre-peak damage and post peak damage or failure stages. A model suitable to describe such a process helps to understand the failure mechanism of rock. The probabilistic damage model is widely used to describe the process of rock failure which can be easily introduced to computer code for numerical simulation. This method is performed to characterize the process of rock failure from a mesoscopic view to a macro view and has achieved some success (Tang et al. 1998, Tang et al. 1998, Tang et al. 2000, Zhu et al. 2004). In those methods, many probabilistic distributions have been employed to characterize the strength distribution of rock elements. Some researchers have made many discussions about those methods (Zhang et al. 2005, Li et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2007, Wong et al. 2006, Basu et al. 2009). In those methods, it's hard to describe the complete process (e.g., compaction stage) of rock under mechanical loading. It's easily to observe the phenomenon of compaction in conventional experiment especially in some hard rock such as marble. In this paper, the maximum entropy theory is combined with probabilistic damage method to compensate the disadvantage above. Based on the experiment of marble failure process, a new model is proposed to describe the whole process of marble failure and the failure mechanism is explained.|","Document Type

The results show that weak surrounding rock layers, a lot of clay mineral components and unreasonable supporting structure and parameters were the immediate causes for the failure, the excavation of old roadway around the winch chamber was the indirect cause, which provided scientific theory basis for the repair of the winch chamber and can be applied to the repair of similar mine chamber damage.
1 INTRODUCTION
The winch chamber in No. III I Mining Area of Yangzhuang Mine was founded in 2006 bearing the III I Mining feeding task and discharging gangue. Since October 2010, field workers have found that there were some cracks in the winch chamber accompanied by stagging off, this phenomenon was particularly fiercer in March 2012. The layer of winch chamber roof fell off seriously, causing tuck net phenomenon obviously with reinforced metal mesh tearing and steel strip breaking. As shown in Figure 1, the floor heave of winch chamber became serious, leading to a serious distortion, and making the winch can't use normally. In order to ensure safety production and avoid the passive situation of the heavy casualties and the stagnation of production, we must study the failure mechanism of winch chamber and adopt comprehensive and effective measures to control it. The failure mechanism was complex. Many researchers at home and abroad have made a lot of researches and have gained great achievements on listening comprehension studies. Manchao He and Xiaoming Sun etc (He et al. 2002, He et al. 2004, Jiang et al. 2005, Jia 2006) put forward a standpoint that weak surrounding rock layers has a great influence on the stability of surrounding rock by analyzing the structure of surrounding rock. Lijun Han (Wang et al. 2005, Li et al. 2012) studied the influence on the stability of surrounding rock and concluded that high content of clay mineral composition was easy to cause damage of surrounding rock.|","Document Type

C., UNSW Australia, Sydney| Saydam, S., UNSW Australia, Sydney","|ABSTRACT: Double Shear Tests (DST) were conducted to understand the performance of rockbolts under shear loading with different pretensions. During testing, five pairs of strain gauges were installed along a rockbolt to measure the variation in tensile strain. Two load cells were also used to measure the normal load generated at either end on the protruding rock bolt. The results showed that the normal load measured with load cell is close to the result calculated from the strain gauges data. In the vicinity of the intersection of joint and bolt, the shear load applied on the rockbolt was converted to the resistance of axial elongation and bending. It was also found that the shear performance is dependent on the tensile elongation capacity to some extent. Furthermore, the interaction of rock and rockbolt with varying pretensions created different magnitude of tension and bend.
1 INTRODUCTION
There has been much theoretical and experimental research undertaken examining the effectiveness of fully grouted rockbolt since the 1970s (Farmer 1975, Hagan 2004, Mahony & Hagan 2006). Some of this work has been directed at understanding the axial and shear behaviour between the rock and grout when tension is applied on the rockbolt (Farmer 1975, Li & Stillborg 1999). Signer et al. (1997) measured the in situ loading of rockbolts to assist the evaluation and selection of roof bolt. Both axial and bending forces were measured by strain gauges at multiple locations along the length of fully grouted bolts during different stages of mining.
However, underground investigations showed that a high proportion of reinforcing elements can fail in shear (Haile 1999). Researchers tried to use the strain gauges to measure the behaviour of axial and bending when the rockbolt was subjected to shearing load. McHugh & Signer (1999) conducted the single shear tests to measure the distribution of axial and bending strain along the rockbolt with different axial load. In their tests, strain gauges were installed in a groove machined along the length of a rockbolt. However, it was demonstrated that the slot reduced axial bolt strength by approximately 10% (McHugh & Signer 1999). Another problem with this test is the strain gauge signal is often terminated before reaching the peak load (McHugh & Signer 1999). Double shear tests were carried out by Jalalifar (2006) to study the contribution of rock bolt to the bolted joint shear strength. Numerical modelling was also adopted to investigate the axial stress distribution. However, the results were not verified by strain gauges.|","Document Type

In the work, two splitting Brazilian loading methods according ISRM standard (method I) and China standard (method II) were employed. The difference between the fracture mechanical behavior of method I and II were very apparent. For fracture time or fracture displacement, the results of method I are large than that of method II. And the fracture toughness of method I is 1.01 MPa·m<U+00BD>, which is about 42% higher than that of the method II (0. 72 MPa · m<U+00BD> ). Excluding the subtle effect of loading rate, the main reasons for above difference of two methods were also discussed. The linear relationship between fracture toughness and fracture displacement was obtained based on the actual measuring data, which provides a valuable understanding for the crack arresting problem.
I INTRODUCTION
1.1 Type area
Rock fracture mechanics can be used to identify and predict the imminent failure of rock mass structures thereby providing guidelines to improve the stability and the safety of these structures. Another application is for the exploitation of mineral resources by adopting techniques such as mechanical mining, blasting and hydraulic fracturing. In fracture processes which are not associated with high strain rates, the mode I plane-strain static fracture toughness gives the critical value of the stress intensity factor leading to the onset of crack growth in that mode. Some of the applications of fracture toughness include index of fragmentation processes like those used in tunnel boring, a modeling parameter in processes such as rock cutting and hydraulic fracturing and for the stability analysis of civil, mining and earthen structures.|","Document Type

1 INTRODUCTION
Research of the mechanism for brittle rock samples failure prepares is important part of prediction and prevent geodynamic phenomenon in rock mass. Phenomenon of reversible linear deformations was discovered during previous research (Makarov et al. 2012). And two-stage model of rock spacemen failure source forming was state during acoustic investigation of high stressed rock samples (Kuksenko et al. 1996). Research of this phenomenon has been continued during experiments with rock samples under uniaxial load in Laboratory of Geodynamics, Far Eastern Federal University (Vladivostok City, Russia). It was found during research, that reversible linear deformations at local measuring areas should be divide up two different types. Relation between reversible linear deformations at local measuring areas and source of failure was determine by means 3-D model of source of failure, made at basis of acoustic emission data. This kind of anomalous deformations of high stressed rock sample was explained by the model of soft-inclusion (Guzev et al. 2007). Also, rock samples failure source forming stages was state at basis of the amplitude-frequency signal analysis.

l INTRODUCTION
With the increase of the crust depth, the vertical in-situ stress was reported to increase about 27 MPa every 1 km. The lateral stress coefficient <U+03BB> (the ratio of horizontal stress to vertical stress) was quite scattered under shallow crust depth. However, as the depth increases, the <U+03BB> value gradually reached to 1.0, which indicated that the horizontal stress was approximately equal to the vertical stress (Brown & Brandy 1978). Recently, the mining depths at a number of underground metal mines have been closed to or exceeded 1 000 m in China (Gu & Li 2006). Due to unloading by excavation, the stress condition of surrounding rock mass is correspondingly changed. For example, it may be changed from triaxial stress condition to biaxial or even one dimensional stress. Afterwards, the rock mass may not resist the adjusted stress after excavation which can lead to rock failure in mining engineering.|","Document Type

Deformation modulus increases slowly along with the decline of confining pressure, but decreases rapidly when unloaded to yielding strength. In the same unloading stress path, the reduction of deformation modulus increases with increasing initial confining pressure. Poisson ratio increases with the decrease of confining pressure during the process of unloading. Rock failure primarily features as shear failure, the features of the rock strength is well reflected by using power function type of Mohr strength criterion.
1 INTRODUCTION
Underground stope excavation results in unbalancing of rock stress. With continuous propulsion of mining face, the exposure area of surrounding rock is increasing constantly. The effects of unloading by excavation make continually deterioration of rock mechanics properties (Yoshinaka et al. 1997). Currently, it uses static and dynamic loading methods to widely studies deformation characteristics of rocks during underground geotechnical projects (Huang 2014).
However, unloading and loading correspond to two different stress paths; subsequently the mechanical properties exhibited are substantially different (Marco 2008, Yin et al. 2012). To better understand the unloading mechanical properties during underground rock excavation, numerous previous scholars have been studied the unloading rock mass. These authors formed excellent contributions in their results, e.g., the concept to the time-dependent expansion of rock damage and earthquakes (Sun 2001), tri-axial unloading confining pressure (You et al. 1998); marble unloading confining pressure strength characteristics (Chen et al. 2008); a real simulation of underground excavation tri-axial experimental study on the rheological properties of shale unloading (Guo 2012); the high confining pressure unloading expansion properties of rock (The Manh et al. 2013); an experimental study on shale unloading rheological properties (Hu et al. 2011) and salt rock unloading confining pressure tests (Reza et al. 2010, Wang et al. 2012, Ha 1998, Liu et al. 2012, Zhou et al. 2009). The unloading confining pressure stress-strain relation process, deformation characteristics and laws have been conducted and studied. However, neither an in-depth study of the deformation characteristics nor the laws of different stress unloading paths have been previously researched. And there is no comparative analysis of deformation parameters or fracture characteristics in different stress paths.|","Document Type

H., Research Institute of Geomechanics, China Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing","|ABSTRACT: Hydro-fracturing in-situ stress measurements were conducted in the Jijicao rock block of the Beishan area in Gansu Province, China. A total of 40 hydro-fracturing tests and 15 fracture impression tests were performed in three sub-vertical boreholes at depths ranging between 30 and 640 m below the ground surface. The measurement results indicate that the maximum horizontal principal stress is generally larger than the vertical stress, indicating that within the range of tested depth, the stress filed is dominated by tectonic horizontal stress. Linear regression analysis on the magnitude of principal stress components with depth shows that the in-situ stress field in this rock block can be characterized by a piecewise distribution in three zones. The measured maximum horizontal principal stresses are mainly oriented in the NNE-NEE direction, approximately parallel to the maximum regional tectonic stress inferred from compressive stress origin due to plate tectonics. This agreement supports the accuracy of the in-situ stress measurement results. It is also found that local fault structures can significantly modify the regional stress field, leading to the rotation of the maximum horizontal stress.
I INTRODUCTION
Safe disposal of High-Level radioactive Waste (HLW) is one of the most challenging rock engineering issues. Over the past few decades, extensive research related to deep geological disposal of HLW has been conducted by the international nuclear community (Wang 2010). In China, work on site selection and characterization for the HLW repository has been carried out since 1985. The efforts have been focused on the Beishan area in Gansu Province of northwestern China, which contains many granite intrusions. During the site selection and characterization in the Beishan area, a series of site investigations and tests have been conducted. The in-situ stress at a site is required for the design of underground engineering structures employing, in particular, numerical tools. Over the last three decades, advances in the use of numerical methods in rock mechanics have been impressive, and nowadays almost all rock engineering design utilized numerical tools. Hence, to provide reasonable modeling parameters of rock stresses and subsequently to optimize design and construction of the HLW repository, reliable assessment of the in-situ stress state at the sites is a prerequisite.|","Document Type

In the Chenhang Island survey, the digital borehole camera technology was utilized for the first time in China to provide guidance and acquire firsthand information of coral reefs, including anomalies in the rock body (e.g. fissures, cavities, traces of biological activities, interfaces, foreign strata and substances, color variations, etc), which also helped determine the causes of low or zero coring rates. In addition, data acquired by borehole camera can be used to evaluate the integrity of coral reefs. It can be concluded that: (1) the borehole camera system is an accurate and effective tool for determining the geological characteristics of coral reefs; (2) the system can serve important purposes in the geological survey of coral reefs.
1 INTRODUCTION
The coral reefs are soil and rock structures formed from the remains of scleractinian corals, shaped by geological forces over a long period (Wei et al. 2008). Their great potential as a natural and military resource lends importance to the geological survey of coral reefs. In the drilling of Chenhang Island in Xisha (Paracel) Islands, we used deep boreholes to obtain rock cores from coral reefs and model their geological structures. The data can be used in the research of climate and environmental changes on a million-year time scale, the study of coral reefs' development and their interaction with the environment, as well as the exploitation of coral reefs for military purposes. The scientific and engineering values of such data would be significant.|","Document Type

Originally, the use of the process was restricted to relatively high permeability sandstones to which the hydrocarbons would flow to and become trapped. Most of the early treatments on the last part of the 1900s were relatively small treatment that bypassed drilling damage and stimulated the target formation a few hundred feet the wellbore. |Evolution of Hydraulic Fracturing |In the early 1990s, advances in modeling contributed to the successful hydraulic fracturing of lower permeability, tight gas environments. New hydraulic fracturing fluid systems enabled a reduction in gel concentrations and improved well productivity. |As tight gas development, in largely sandstone formations, continued into the mid-2000s, multi-zone pays become of interest to the operators. A key enabler to stimulating discreet intervals over a large gross interval was the introduction of more efficient staging technologies. During this era, it was not uncommon for an operator to stimulate 5 to 10 small sands over a +200 ft of gross interval in a single fracturing event. To make these wells economic, the operator had to perform this operation a dozen or more times on each well. In this period, we also saw the introduction of pad drilling where an offshore mentality was used to drill multiple land wells from a single surface location. In turn, this enabled us to work more efficiently. |Towards the end of the last decade, we saw the emergence of unconventional shale resources. In the beginning, shale gas was the main target. But, as the process of combining horizontal wells with multistage fracturing was further refined, the technique was also applied to tight oil reservoirs. The key to success in the shale resources is maximizing reservoir contact. The difference between gas and oil in this environment is that gas wells utilized slickwater fluids to introduce fracturing complexities while oil required higher conductivity and utilized primarily conventional crosslinked fluid systems. Additionally, job sizes in unconventional oil wells are typically smaller in size than their gas well counterparts and injection rates are lower.|",""

Although there are different sources of energy, in-depth assessment and analyses suggest that the world will rely heavily on fossil fuels for many decades to come, Fig. 1. A key resource in this energy equation is the natural gas. After the development and exploitation of the conventional gas resources, the more challenging unconventional resources have become a major target for future energy supply and are critically assessed and exploited to supplement in meeting the world energy demand. The primary mechanism to produce unconventional gas is the novel multistage hydraulic fracturing conducted in long horizontal wells. |The petroleum industry has been using hydraulic fracturing to commercially produce low to moderate permeability gas reservoirs. A successful fracturing treatment to achieve improved and sustained well productivity requires strategic planning from the very onset of the field development that includes geological and seismic study, well placement and trajectory, wellbore configuration, and optimal completion placement. The entire multidisciplinary team, from geoscience to petroleum engineering, needs to be fully involved for a successful completion of a tight gas field development project, Fig. 2. |Depending on the reservoir characteristics, wells are drilled so that multiple fractures can initiate independently and high contact area is achieved creating easy flow path for the hydrocarbon from the reservoir to the wellbore. The influx of hydrocarbon is directly proportional to the surface area open to the wellbore, Fig. 3. The surface area is increased when fractures propagate perpendicular to the wellbore and multiple independent fractures can be created without overlaps, Fig. 4. |The selection of appropriate completion techniques, such as open hole or plug & perf, is also critical and depends on reservoir and completion characteristics as well as operational logistics. |The selection of fracturing fluids, additives, and proppant types are major components when designing and implementing a hydraulic fracturing treatment. A viscous, unbroken fracture fluid that may remain after the treatment compounds the effects of fracture face skin and causes severe deterioration to proppant conductivity thereby shadowing fracturing benefits. The fracture fluid footprint must be reduced while not negatively impacting its proppant carrying characteristics.|","Document Type

Derek, University of Alberta| Holmberg, Mats, Tunnel Engineering AB| Carlsson, Anders, Carlson GeoEngineering AB","|Abstract|The Aspo Expansion project required the excavation of approximately 300mof new experimental tunnels on the 410 Level. At this depth there is a hydraulic head of approximately 365 m. The project design required that the maximum allowable draw down not exceed 50mrelative to the initial conditions. Borehole inflow tests carried out in the pilot holes before construction commenced provided a model for relating the inflows and draw downs. Based on previous experience at Aspo HRL, grouting was selected as a cost effective solution. The grouting strategy used the methodology developed for Real Time Grouting Control (RTGC). The principles of the Observational Method as specified in Eurocode 7, in conjunction with the RTGC were successfully used in the design and construction of the Aspo Expansion project that limited the drawdown to approximately 25 m. 
1. Introduction|New demonstration experiments supporting the technology required for the implementation of the design of the KBS-3 geological nuclear waste repository required construction of two main tunnels and several large niches at the 410-m level of the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL), Figure 1.The construction of these facilities complete with the installation of infrastructure and furnishings suitable for the experimental purposes is referred to as the Aspo Expansion Project. One of the design constraints for the project was that the water pressure (expressed in metres) above the experimental area should be kept within 50mof its initial level prior to construction. Past experience at the HRL demonstrated that cement grouting technology at the 450 m-Level was a viable method for limiting inflows to small single heading tunnels. However it was not known if the technology would be suitable for controlling the head loss with more complex geometry and large caverns.
A pilot hole was drilled along the axis of each tunnel and used to characterize the groundwater flow system. Amonitoring system and short duration flowtests demonstrated a rock mass permeability with good connectivity. It became obvious that the 50m drawdown constraint would easily be exceeded if the tunnel pregrouting was not successful. In order to reduce the project technical risks and costs to acceptable levels, it was proposed to design and construct the tunnels and caverns using the Observational Method as outlined in EUROCODE-7. |","Document Type

Eurocode 7 requires the characteristic values of geotechnical parameters to be selected as cautious estimates of the values affecting the occurrence of the limit state. In this paper we re-analyse some historical strength data of Delabole slate and thus show some difficulties associated with characterisation of the strength of anisotropic rock. The strength data are grouped according to the orientation of the cleavage relative to the applied major principal stress, and Bayesian regression used to model peak strength as a function of confining pressure for each group. The analysis indicates that both variance of strength and the effect of confining pressure on strength are dependent on orientation. This suggests that strength characteristic values are not intrinsic properties, but are dependent on the loading state. This concept is currently not embodied within Eurocode 7, and so the paper concludes with suggestions for essential developments required to enable introducing strength anisotropy into limit state design. 
1. Introduction
Eurocode 7 (CEN 2004) (EC7) requires the characteristic value of a geotechnical parameter to be selected as a cautious estimate of the value affecting the occurrence of the limit state. Also, the Code requires selection of characteristic values for geotechnical parameters to be based on results and derived values from laboratory and field tests, complemented by well-established experience. 
In the case of rocks with planes of anisotropy, such as foliation, cleavage or sedimentary structures, material strength has long been known to vary with the orientation of the applied major principal stress relative to the anisotropy planes (Jaeger 1960; Donath 1961). EC7 recognises this phenomenon, and notes that where applicable, it must be considered when assessing uniaxial compressive strength (UCS). EC7 is silent with regards triaxial strength. 
In practice, it is only possible to test samples at a finite number of orientations, and the strength must be estimated for other orientations. 
A review of the literature shows that numerous criteria and testing strategies have been proposed to capture the variation of strength with different loading orientations. On the basis of an extensive review, Duveau et al. (1998) classified the available criteria into the three distinct groups of mathematical continuous, empirical continuous, and discontinuous weakness plane models. More recent attempts to characterise strength anisotropy include those of Tien & Kuo (2001), Nasseri et al. (2003), Saroglou & Tsiambaos (2008) and Fjaer & Nes (2013). Although EC7 explicitly requires due account to be taken of anisotropy, no guidance is provided for either testing strategies or strength model selection. |","Document Type

The design following EC7 must be based on a combination of calculations, prescriptive measures, experimental model and observational method. The observational method must rely on the best design that can be done in advance taken in account all prevailing uncertainties, aleatoric or epistemic. In rock mechanics, as we dont usually know the state of stress or strain in the rock, active or interactive design shall rely on the deformations measures as well as on good knowledge of the geology and structure of the rock mass to define limit states. The peculiarities due to rock mechanics in the enforcement of the observational method are emphasized. Some directions for active design will be given to better define the method and insure safe design.
1. Introduction
EN 1997-1 named Eurocode 7 (EC7) CEN (2004) deals with geotechnical design. In this design it is fundamental to check that the structure fulfils relevant criteria. These can be divided in two types, ultimate and serviceability limit states. One or a combination of following shall check the avoidance of exceeding the limit states:
 Use of calculations Adoption of prescriptive measures Experimental models and load tests Observational method
In structural engineering and soil mechanics calculation is the most commonly applied procedure for checking. It requires that the ground conditions are relatively well defined. The adoption of prescriptive measures means that a well-established and proven design is adopted underwell-defined ground and loading conditions without calculation. Tests on models or full scale tests can be useful for single and independent structures. The observational method is normally appliedwhen the prediction of the geotechnical behavior is difficult like when the ground conditions are complex or not sufficiently well known. 
The objective of this paper is to discuss if the observational method as defined in EC7 can be applied for rock mechanics design and if not suggest necessary changes.|","Document Type

A probabilistic analysis is applied to rock slope stability with an example case of a rock slope with translational potential failure mode. The capacity and the demand are represented as independent triangular random variables. The distribution of the factor of safety is found analytically and its reliability measures are evaluated, allowing for decisions to be taken in terms of risk and reliability. The same slope is examined in its limit state by applying the partial factors approach of Eurocode 7. The Eurocode design is compared to the traditional factor of safety and probability of failure. 
1. Introduction
Numerous uncertainties, arising from natural variability in space and time, experimental errors, imprecise information, insufficient knowledge, up-scaling, simplistic assumptions, etc., are pervasive in rock engineering. These are commonly taken into account, indirectly, in the traditional factor of safety design, where acceptable safety factors are selected through experience or regulation, depending on application and its importance (e.g. Priest & Brown 1983). Some drawbacks may be recognized in this approach (Yucemen et al. 1973).The same value of the safety factor is adopted (or imposed) for a particular type of application, regardless of the degree of uncertainty involved (Duncan 2000), the risk level associated with it, or the amount and quality of information available before and acquired during construction.The type of uncertainty is also relevant to rock engineering (Bedi & Harrison 2013) and its assessment essential for reliable design (Bagheri & Stille 2011). Limit States Design (LSD) in Eurocode 7 (CEN 2004) introduced several changes to the previous geotechnical design practice. Verification at the ultimate limit state requires that the design actions, increased to reflect a low probability of occurrence, be lower than the design resistances, which have been factored down to reflect prescribed (or intended) probabilities of being exceeded. The values of the partial factors of the characteristic actions and material parameters are largely associated to variability and other uncertainties and therefore the partial factors approach may be considered as a form of reliability based design, although for complex systems the relation of the partial factors to the intended failure probabilities may be somewhat difficult to observe. Calibration of the partial factor design equations has been primarily based on method a of Figure 1, where the relation between the various calibration methods considered by EN 1900 (CEN, 2002) is presented. There, the probabilistic calibration procedures are divided into Level II reliability and Level III probabilistic methods. |","Document Type

This article focuses on the practical theory of how to design (geotechnically and structurally) a strip foundation using only one method based on ultimate limit state (ULS) and serviceability limit state (SLS). The method takes the following into account as geotechnical requirements: contact pressure, total settlement and angular distortions. As far as structural requirements are concerned, the method considers admissible plastic rotations, end moments due to displacement angle, as well as control of cracking. This article also examines how the contact pressure distribution depends on safety factor and contact material. The contact pressure in ULS and SLS is the same and the contact pressure distribution in ULS is determined according to the settlement calculations of theoretically separated minimum foundations. SLS values can be calculated when dividing ULS values by a combination of partial factors on actions.
1. Introduction
Nowadays there are several software programs that evaluate the interaction between ground, foundations, and structures. There is, however, a lack of demonstrations of manual calculation methods that would complement such computerized calculations, verify their reliability, or could be used directly for estimating the ground-foundation interaction. 
Because of the above-mentioned insufficiency, the author developed a simple design method based on his research work (Avellan 1992, 2011), and practical experience (Avellan & Maanas 2001). 
The method was developed for soil-structureinteraction but can be used where the ground is disintegrated rock, very low strength rock, weathered rock, or it consists of weak clay shales. Disintegrated rock is classified on geological strength index for jointed rock with block sizes and are based on Cai et al. (2004), Hoek et al. (2013) and modified by Martin et al. (2013). Examples of fractured and weak rock are described by Piteau (Piteau 1982) and in Canadian Foundation Engineering Manual (2006). In the authors homeland Finland the bedrock is good but there are areas were the rock is weak (Sarkka 1981).|","Document Type

A series of clay shale specimens in equilibrium with various applied suction pressures were used to study the influence of total suction on rock mechanical properties such as Youngs modulus, Poissons ratio, onset of dilatancy, unconfined compressive strength and Brazilian tensile strength. An almost linear increase in unconfined compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength, stress at the onset of dilatancy and Youngs modulus with increasing suction was observed to a total suction of 56.6MPa. For total suction >56.6MPa, a relatively constant strength and stiffness was observed. The increase in strength and stiffness is associated with the net contribution of total suction, which decreases non-linearly with decreasing volumetric water content. The rate of increase in tensile strength and unconfined compressive strength with increasing total suction is different depending on the rock anisotropy. Thus, the anisotropy in strength is state-dependent. 
1. Introduction
Characterizing the behaviour, and quantifying geomechanical properties of clay shales can be challenging. Its often very low permeability combined with its pervasive bedding and geological history, and the sensitivity of strength and stiffness to little changes in saturation complicates the interpretation of even the simplest laboratory strength tests. The strength dependency on saturation is primarily related to an increase in total suction (<U+03C8>) associated with the pore size distribution of the clay shale. Controlled laboratory tests were utilized to quantify changes in tensile and compressive strength, elastic properties, and brittle failure characteristics of a brittle clay shale with changing total suction. Opalinus Clay, a clay shale considered as host rock for the disposal of nuclear waste in Switzerland was utilized. 
2. Methods

Water retention characteristics were established from specimens imposed to various relative humidity (RH) in desiccators under stress free conditions. Constant predefined relative humidity were achieved and maintained by utilizing supersaturated salt solutions (Table 1). During exposing the specimens to these different environments, the air temperature in the laboratory was held constant at 21±0.5°C, and the RH in the desiccators was monitored.

In offshore Iran, wellbore instability is quite common and the main cause for most of problems during drilling operations. In this study, the existing relevant logs, drilling and other data from offset well were analyzed and integrated to construct a precise Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) describing pore pressure, stress magnitudes and orientation, and formation mechanical properties of the South Pars Gas field. Then, the constructed MEM was refined and calibrated using the existing caliper, image logs, rock mechanical core test and drilling data and through history matching to constrain and reduce the uncertainties associated with limitations and availability of the existing data. Using the validated MEM built for offset well, a sensitivity analysis by formation was performed to evaluate optimum drilling parameters and to evaluate the stability of future deviated or horizontal wells in the field. Finally, a quantitative risk study was conducted to assess the sensitivity of breakout and fracturing mud weights to various input parameters. Results indicate that the stable mud weight window decreases as the borehole deviation increases in the most of formations except reservoir section. It was shown that well azimuth has very little impact on the breakout mud weight, while the breakdown mud weight is significantly higher in wells drilled in the minimum horizontal stress direction. Moreover, It would be better to keep the well deviation as low as possible and not more than 45 and 60 degrees in the Kazhdumi and Fahlyan-Surmeh formations, respectively.
1. Introduction
Wellbore stability maintenance is a crucial step during drilling a well for oil and gas production. Wellbore instability problems may cause increasing wellbores drilling costs, delay in drilling of the wellbore and in severe conditions wellbore abandonment. It is estimated that at least 10% of the average well budget is used on unplanned operations resulting from wellbore instability. These costs may approach one billion dollars per year worldwide (Aadnoy 2003). The simplest constitutive model for describing the behavior of rocks is linear elastic, which is the foundation for all aspects of rock mechanics. This theory is based on the concepts of stress and strain, which are related according to simple Hookes law.Two parameters are required for describing the elastic response of a material: Youngs modulus and Poissons ratio. The solution of a given problem considering the elasticity theory consists on the determination of the stress, strain, and displacement components. Bradley (1979a) and Fjaer et al. (1992) among others presented analytical equations to compute stresses around boreholes. They assumed a state of plane strain. The derivation of the stress solution is in the study presented by Jaeger and Cook (1979), and the final equations are given by Bradley (1979a) and Fjaer et al. (1992).|","Document Type

The observational method is today an accepted method in Eurocode 7 for design of geotechnical structures. However, case studies with formal application of its principles are still rare. One reason could be that the method to some extent is considered complex and associated with low safety margins. In fact, the Eurocode does not give any reference to how the safety of the completed structure can be assured. This paper strives to open up a discussion on how the observational method can be improved by including a requirement for a safety margin of the completed structure. A methodology is outlined and illustrated with a simple calculation example analysing the safety of a square rock pillar. Lastly, the compatibility with the observational method is discussed.
1. Introduction|When designing underground excavations in rock, the engineer must inevitably consider the uncertainties related to the properties of the rock in one way or another. A common approach is to be conservative in the design, but this is not always economically sound or possible in practice. For situations when it is difficult to predict the geotechnical behaviour, Eurocode 7 (CEN 2004) suggests applying the observational method. This method was first outlined by Terzaghi and later defined by Peck (1969). 
When applying the observational method, a preliminary design is first prepared based on any available knowledge about the conditions and properties at the site. During the construction phase, the behaviour of the structure is observed. The essence of the observational method is to establish plans in advance, which infallibly put necessary contingency actions into operation if the behaviour is unacceptable. These measures accommodate the structure to the actual conditions at the site. The crucial challenge is to relate a measurable parameter to the structural behaviour and define the acceptable range of the parameter, so that the structure still meets all requirements even after the design has been altered by contingency actions. To facilitate an economically sound construction, the preliminary design must in addition be made so that contingency actions are sufficiently unlikely to be needed. 
Case studies describing and discussing the formal application of the observational method as defined in the Eurocode are still rare (Spross & Larsson, in press), even though the method at a glance can seem straightforward. It can however be argued that less strictly defined observational approaches sometimes are used in practice. Even so, concerns regarding low safety margins have been put forward, as reported by Powderham (2002). The concerns are not surprising; the benefit of the observational method is to permit less conservative designs than other approaches, leaving to the designing engineer to interpret how to make the best use of the method. However, this benefit is also one of the major drawbacks, as the available guidelines (Frank et al. 2004) give virtually no guidance at all regarding suitable safety requirements for the structure. This implies that the safety margin of the completed structure is at best arbitrary, but possibly totally unknown. |","Document Type

K., Geomechanica Inc.| Kaifosh, P., Geomechanica Inc.| Vietor, T., National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (NAGRA)| Grasselli, G., University of Toronto","|Abstract|Experimental evidence based on microseismic data clearly show that fluid-pressure-driven fractures interact with preexisting discontinuities, thus highlighting the strong influence of rock mass structures on hydraulic fracture development. However, these mechanisms are not well accounted for by analytical models and conventional continuum-based numerical approaches. The purpose of this paper is to assess the use of an alternative hybrid finite-discrete element (FDEM) code, enhanced with hydraulic fracturing capabilities, to model pressure-driven fracturing in jointed rock masses. The proposed approach is first validated by comparing the emergent pressure response and fracture patterns simulated under homogeneous isotropic conditions with available analytical solutions. Then, the effect of rock mass discontinuities on the hydraulic fracturing process is investigated for several joint geometries.
1. Introduction
In rock engineering, the termhydraulic fracturing (HF) refers to the injection of fluid into a sealed-off borehole interval to induce and propagate fractures into the surrounding rock mass. Typical applications of this technique include the estimation of the stress state at depth as well as the stimulation of unconventional reservoirs. Conventional analyses of HF operations are based upon the solution of the stress distribution around a circular borehole in a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic material subjected to far-field compressive stresses (e.g., Hubbert and Willis (1957)). Considering these simple and idealistic assumptions, the accuracy of analyses carried out by this approach may be debatable. In particular, the rock mass is often characterized by the presence of preexisting discontinuities (e.g., fractures, faults) or layering (e.g., bedding planes) having variable orientations with respect to the principal stress directions. In this case, the fundamental assumptions of the analytical approaches, namely continuity, homogeneity and isotropy, are clearly not satisfied. 
In this context, the scope of this study was to evaluate a hybrid finite-discrete element (FDEM) code enhanced with HF capabilities as a tool to simulate fluid-pressure-driven fracturing in jointed rock masses. FDEM is a numerical technique which combines the advantages of the Finite Element Method (FEM) in describing the continuum behaviour of the intact material, with the ability of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to capture the interaction between fractured discrete blocks. Furthermore, FDEM captures the transition from continuum to discontinuum by explicitly considering fracture and fragmentation processes. In this work, homogeneous isotropic models were first considered in order to validate the numerical results with respect to analytical solutions. Then, the numerical simulations investigated if and how a preexisting fracture may influence the fracture trajectory and the injection pressure response. Input data and stress conditions from the in-situ stress measurement campaigns in the geothermal borehole Schlattingen-1 (Switzerland) (Klee, 2012) and the borehole BDS-5 (Derriere, Mont Terri, Switzerland) (Klee, 2011) were used as reference.|","Document Type

The GeneSys project aims to develop low-permeability sediments of the Northern German Basin for geothermal energy supply in order to heat the BGR Geo Center in Hanover, Germany. In May 2011 a massive frac operation was carried out to create a large heat exchanger in sediments of the Middle Bunter at 3700m depth. Subsequent to the frac operation, two low-rate injection tests were performed below fracture-closure pressure at initial effective normal stresses of approximately 3.5MPa and 5MPa, respectively. The injection phases of the two tests provide evidence for a large and highly conductive fracture although proppants were not used during the entire frac operation. We calculated hydraulically active fracture areas of more than 0.5 km<U+00B2> from the analysis of the pressure transient during the tests relying on matrix permeabilities determined in laboratory experiments. In principle, such areas are sufficient to yield geothermal power in the range of 2MW. The hydraulic fracture properties diminished between the two low-rate injection tests and hence, with increasing effective normal stress. We suppose this observation is due to pressure-dependent self-propping effects. The pressure records during the shut-in phases of the two tests could not be explained with conventional hydraulic models. The continuous increase in normal effective stress may affect the shut-in pressure transient to an extent that conventional analysis cannot account for but require extensions for hydro-mechanical coupling.
1. Introduction
Profitable extraction of geothermal energy from lowpermeability formations requires hydraulic stimulation. The GeneSys project aims at the development of a low-permeability, sedimentary reservoir of the Northern German Basin for the provision of geothermal energy to heat the facilities of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) in Hanover, Germany. At the geothermal test site, the BGR wants to demonstrate an innovative cyclic concept using one borehole, only (Krug et al., submitted for publication). 
In May 2011 a massive frac operation was performed to create a large heat exchanger in the underground (Tischner et al., 2013). The target formations were stimulated by injecting 20,000m3 of freshwater, without the addition of proppants or any other additives. 
Proppants are frequently used during frac operations with the aim to maintain hydraulic conductivity of fractures below closure pressure (Smith and Shlyapobersky, 2000, Zimmermann and Reinicke, 2010). Using proppants increases the costs of a fracture treatment and requires chemical additives in the frac fluid that present a potential environmental threat. At the geothermal test site Horstberg, Germany, Jung et al. (2005) demonstrated that unpropped water fractures in low-permeability sediments stayed permeable below closure pressure and that it is possible to extract geothermal energy by relying on a cyclic concept. Apart from the field experiments in Horstberg, only little experience has been collected with pure water fracs in low-permeability sediments.|","Document Type

A geomechanical survey of selected rock samples from outcrops and shallow stratigraphic wells taken from the vicinity of the prospect area has been conducted in order to obtain data and parameters useful for the selection of optimum drill bits prior to the drilling of a wildcat well in a frontier basin located in NW Africa. The available geological and drilling information suggests that the basin rocks are hard to very hard and abrasive, what will significantly increase the costs of the planned wildcat. Thus, this work is aimed at reducing drilling costs and to improve ROPs at the time of drilling by assessing realistic working properties from the drill bit selection point of view. The geomechanical survey included UCS, CCS, Schmidt hammer rebound and point load indexes, VP<.sub> & VS wave propagation data (including high pressure hydrostatic determinations) and slake durability tests. A summary of the main results is presented here. 
1. Introduction|It is a well-known fact that drilling operations carry associated significant costs for the oil and gas industry so that if we are able to enhance drilling performance by increasing the Rate of Penetration (ROP) of drill bits, the expected outcome will be a direct impact over the economics of exploration/exploitation projects. 
Choosing the adequate drill bits combined with the appropriate drilling parameters can substantially reduce drilling costs. However, the development of criteria for the optimum drill bit selection has to take into account a number of rock-dependent properties, most of them varying along the corresponding lithological section. The assessment of the relevant rock mechanics properties is based on different approaches, including testing in the laboratory rocks analog to the ones expected during drilling operations combined with wireline log derived parameters. 
Taking into account the previous approach, in this work we present a summary of the results obtained in an exploration project located in a frontier basin, with very limited geological information. So far, the single drilled well in the basin has faced strong to very strong rock sequences (Brown, 1981), with an extremely low ROP. However, a future wild cat well will require improved ROP so that it was decided to conduct an in-advance assessment of the geomechanical properties of the materials of interest by obtaining representative cores of the target formations located in the vicinity of the prospect area. From these cores, a number of representative plugs were selected to conduct a comprehensive study that includes mineralogy, petrology, geochemistry, rock mechanics as well as some borehole stability simulations. Such an approach, that entails a significant challenge in terms of the uncertainties derived from the representativeness of tested samples, may reduce the drilling expenses by providing key information for drill bit selection and better constrained well design. |","Document Type

Developing resource shale and/or tight plays can be extensive and demanding, particularly when determining an optimal multi-stage fracture stimulation design. A common approach has been to duplicate the so-called Barnett design, such as using a slick water fracturing fluid with a low concentration of proppant. However, it has been proven that the Barnett design was inefficient in many other fields, such as the Haynesville, Bakken, and Eagle Ford. A recent trend for developing resource shale and tight plays has been to attain an analog field, duplicate the design optimized in the analog field, and further optimize its design by trial and error. However, even this approach requires a considerable learning curve and associated costs to determine the optimal multi-stage fracturing design. Shale geomechanics can help minimize this learning curve and provide optimal fracture design recommendations based on geomechanical analysis combined with geological, geophysical, and petrophysical knowledge. 
1. Introduction
After successful development of the Barnett shale, other resource shale and tight plays have been commercialized all over North America, and now extending to Central/South America, Europe, China, Australia, and Russia. The success of resource shale and tight plays has mainly derived from technological advancements during the past 10 years, including large volume multistage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal completions, passive microsiesmic monitoring, and expanded use of 3D seismic of the fields. 
These recent technological advancements in resource shale and tight plays present unique engineering challenges with respect to geomechanics, such as long, horizontal well drilling and completion methods that allowcomplex multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulation design. Exceptionally long horizontal drilling can create significant wellbore stability issues, which are stress-induced and time-dependent, from fluid-formation interaction. Complex multistage hydraulic fracture designs require extensive geomechanical information for optimization, such as selection of well placement, horizontal well direction, stage isolation method, stage interval selection, perforation locations, and fracturing fluid system/proppant selection. 
Such demanding challenges can be addressed, fully or partially, by integrating all geomechanical information obtained from geological, geophysical, petrophysical, and laboratory data. Geophysical and petrophysical analyses of natural fractures and faults can also be used during the final multi-stage hydraulic fracture design.|","Document Type

The depletion of oil reservoirs causes significant effects on its surroundings. During the lifetime of an oil field, well integrity should be taken into account under the geomechanical perspective. The aim of this work is to show the influence of geomechanical effects over the integrity of an oil well, employing partially coupled fluid-mechanical simulations. The Namorado Field (Campos Basin, Brazil) was adopted in this study as a black-oil model. Since the geomechanical effects were obtained in the reservoir scale, a special workflow had to be followed in order to obtain the stress field at the well scale. The submodeling technique was used to analyze the casing response under the effects observed in the global simulation. The well casing collapse was evaluated in the submodel by the von Mises criterion. The simulation results showed the importance of employing a rigorous fluid-mechanical methodology in well integrity analysis. 
1. Introduction
From the geomechanical point of view, the problematic of wells and reservoirs is often distinctly addressed, mainly because the scale difference. Although the system behaves in an integrated way, the association of the phenomena involved in the analysis of wells and reservoirs is frequently neglected. The wells are linear constructions whose geomechanical behavior is closely related to the stress state of the rock which is going through, to the fluid employed during drilling, to the drilling direction and to the casing type. By the activities performed through the well, the reservoir undergoes significant changes in its equilibrium configuration, once the production (or injection) of fluid in the porous medium causes significant variations in their pore pressure and therefore in its stress state. Nevertheless, the reservoir effects spread through the adjacent rocks, many of which are crossed by wells that propel the geomechanical changes. 
One of the major difficulties of conducting an overall well-reservoir analysis lies on the difference of scales between the mentioned problems. A multiscale analysis, a priori, requires the construction of more complex models, which may be limited depending on the numerical methods that are used. The difference between scales is a problem addressed in the Petroleum Engineering literature, especially in terms of scale adaptation of the properties distribution to feed numerical simulation models. However, little has been found in the literature on joint consideration of wells and reservoir under a geomechanical point of view, employing multiscale numerical simulations that take into account the fluid-mechanical phenomena in a coupled way. |","Document Type

The main objective was to investigate if the fractures in the Cretaceous, containing the gas reserves, were capable of deliver their resources to the upper layer (Oligocene), where the wells are producing. 
For this project, was develop a new workflow to measure in the lab, fracture permeability at different reservoir conditions, a new discrete fracture model, and core fractures where characterized and associated to rock facies.

1. Introduction
The gas field studied in this project is localized in Eastern Venezuela, containing some associated condensate and a tar rim, which was not set on production till 1983. The field is an over trust highly fractured anticline with a vertical relieve of 1300 m, covering an area of 18<U+00D7>4 km2,which involves Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs. The Ultimate Recoverable Reserves are 3.32 TCF with 31.8 MMBls of Oil (IHS Energy, 2013), is starting to decline production. 
The main task of this project was to predict future production and pressure decline, with special attention to see if the field needs in the near future some Enhance Gas recovery to deliver the maximum of its reserves. For conventional reservoirs, this is a strait forward exercise, normally done with the Eclipse simulator, but for this field this cannot be done in such a way, since it is an unconventional reservoir, where the gas reserves comes from natural fractures in the Upper Cretaceous carbonate formations, which feed the main Oligocene siliciclastic reservoir, where all the wells are producing (see figure 1). Thus, we had looked for an innovated way to do it properly. 
The solution came integrating geomechanics, geology and reservoir engineering, for which the reservoir was studied again, natural fractures from seismic to core scale where characterized, experiments with cores where performed to understand changes in permeability in the fractures, well production history was looked again, and correlations were done with geological parameters such as rock facies and Unconfined Rock Strength (UCS).|","Document Type

Zero-thickness joint/interface elements of the Goodman type, have been advantageously used to solve many problems in solid mechanics involving material interfaces or discontinuities. Some years ago, the authors have also proposed a version of such element for flow/diffusion and hydro-mechanical (H-M) coupled problems, either geomechanical or multiphysics. Some advantages are for instance that fluid pressure discontinuities and localized flow lines may be represented on the same FE mesh used for the mechanical problem, as well as the influence of fluid pressure on mechanical stresses or, conversely, of crack openings on the flow redistribution (cubic law). In the paper, previous developments are briefly described, together with some new Geomechanical applications under development, particularly the application to the hydraulic fracture problems, which in the past have been studied mainly via analytical or semi-analytical formulations, or using mixed FE-FD approaches.
Introduction
Interface or joint elements of zero-thickness type (Goodman et al. 1968), have been successfully used to solve many problems in solid mechanics involving material interfaces or discontinuities. These elements are inserted in between standard elements to allow jumps in the solution field. Their kinematic constitutive (strain-type) variables are relative displacements, and the corresponding static (stress-type) variables are stress tractions. 
In particular, the authors have used them for representing rock joints in the context of rock masses, contacts between soil and steel reinforcement in reinforced earth structures, or cracks in concrete or other quasibrittle materials, etc. (Gens et al. 1995, Caballero et al. 2007). Each application requires different constitutive laws, either frictional-type (Gens et al. 1990) or fracture-based with elasto-plastic structure (Carol et al. 1997). 
Some years ago, the authors have also proposed a version of such element for flow/diffusion, either of geo-mechanical (Segura & Carol 2004) or multiphysics type (Idiart et al. 2011). Some advantages are for instance that fluid pressure discontinuities and localized flow lines may be represented on the same FE mesh used for the mechanical problem, as well as the influence of fluid pressure on mechanical stresses or, conversely, of crack openings on the flow redistribution (cubic law). More recent developments include advanced monolithic implementation (Segura & Carol 2004), return map algorithms and consistent tangent operator for the constitutive laws and other advanced strategies (Caballero et al. 2008).|","Document Type

The stress intensity factor at a fracture tip in a porous medium subjected to a fluid injection is studied. This factor evolves during the transient flow phase and tends to a limit value for the steady state. For simple fracture geometries, the finite element simulations show that for constant injection pressures this factor reaches its maximum value in the steady state regime. This result allows simplifying significantly the study and modeling of hydraulic fracture propagation because the determination of the steady flow solution is much easier and faster than the transient flow. In addition, some couplings between hydraulic and mechanical problems disappear under steady state flow and make it possible to establish some closed-form approximate expressions. These can be useful especially in the context of CO<U+2082> sequestration projects where the fluid injection is pressure-controlled.
1. Introduction
Hydraulic fracture propagation attracts a lot of attention for its applications to important problems including oil production, shale gas production, geothermal energy and CO<U+2082> sequestration. Predictive modeling of this process meets many difficulties in experimental as well as numerical approaches and even on some theoretical issues. This article focuses on numerical aspects. Indeed, even when the reservoir rock has been well characterized for its permeability and mechanical parameters, numerical modeling of fracture propagation presents real difficulties, mainly because numerous phenomena are implied in this process: fluid diffusion in the fracture and in the matrix, fracture-matrix mass exchanges, plasticity and damage in the fracture tip because of high stress concentrations in this zone and finally the fracture propagation itself. This latter phenomenon changes the continuous material to discontinuous and is not easy to handle in numerical codes. For this reason, hydraulic fracture models have always included necessarily different simplification assumptions. A basic simplification model for the fracture-matrix mass exchange was proposed by Carter (1957) considering it as a one-dimensional, pressure-independent diffusion. On the basis of this model, and within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics and lubrication theory for fluid diffusion in the fracture Adachi & Detournay (2008) analyzed the general solution of a plane strain hydraulic fracture in terms of dimensionless parameters for hydraulic or mechanical, conservative or dissipative phenomena. These authors determined different regimes in which one or several of these phenomena could be neglected and so the whole model could be simplified. |","Document Type

To examine effects of different rock failure criteria on stress magnitudes constrained from borehole breakouts, a real borehole breakout data set from a scientific ocean drilling project as a model case was used to constrain maximum and minimum horizontal stress magnitudes based on the Mohr-Coulomb and the modified Wiebols-Cook criteria. Comparison of the constrained stress magnitudes showed that effects of criterion on the constrained stress magnitudes were not negligible.
1. Introduction
Stress as well as strain are the most fundamental concepts to rock mechanics. To determine in situ stress state is a very important measurement issue in both the geoengineering and geoscience fields. Drilling is the most popular way to access into the deep part in underground and to conduct various in situ measurements, experiments, monitoring, and to get geological materials as research samples. In such deep drilling, a borehole wall compressive failure phenomenon called borehole breakout has been utilized as one of the most essential and useful methods of in-situ stress measurement from 1980s (Zoback et al., 2003). 
In addition to orientations of the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses, borehole breakouts can also yield stress magnitude constrains, i.e. possible range where the maximum and minimum horizontal stress magnitudes lie within based on a rock compressive failure criterion (strength criterion). Because there are different rock failure criteria, e.g., Mohr-Coulomb criterion, the stress magnitudes constrained are not unique but depend on the rock failure criterion applied. In this study, I constrained the maximum and minimum horizontal stress magnitudes based on two different rock failure criteria using a real breakout data set from an ocean drilling project to examine effects of different failure criteria on the stress magnitudes constrained.|","Document Type

R., ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company| DeDontney, N. L., ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company| Alramahi, B., ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company","|Abstract
Quantifying shale strength anisotropy associated with the presence of relatively weak sedimentary laminations is particularly important for extended reach drilling as interaction between borehole stresses and anisotropic formation strength can ultimately lead to catastrophic wellbore instability. To increase fundamental understanding of this failure mechanism, we investigate the potential for treating shales as composite bilaminate materials and use finite element models with variably inclined layers to simulate direct laboratory testing. Resultant strength anisotropy exhibits many of the features observed from laboratory testing of orientated shale samples and suggests that strength reduction due to the activation of weak bedding laminations should be predictable from knowledge of the bulk trans-laminar strength without recourse to costly and time-consuming laboratory testing, which has significant implications for the successful drilling of high-angle/horizontal wells.
1. Introduction
Shales constitute over 75% of drilled formations worldwide and the majority of drilling problems encountered in the subsurface leading to nonproductive time can be directly attributed to some form of shale instability (Azar & Robello Samuel, 2007). It is well-established in the industry that a common chemical mechanism responsible for instability results when smectite-rich shales swell and weaken on exposure to water-based muds (Lal, 1999). A second mechanical failure mechanism particular to shales that has been largely overlooked by the industry relates to the presence of weak bedding laminations which can impart significant strength anisotropy to shale formations. 
This effect is particularly pronounced for Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) wells in which the borehole trajectory can achieve near-parallelism with bedding such that interaction between the borehole hoop stress and the anisotropic formation can result in oblique loading of these weak bedding laminations leading to premature shear failure (Fig. 1). Depending on the relative magnitudes of anisotropic rock strength and borehole stress concentration, breakouts may occur at unexpected positions around the borehole different from those conventionally found in isotropic rock (Willson et al, 2007) leading ultimately to catastrophic failure.|","Document Type

An integrated hydro-mechanical assessment of the Ketzin pilot site for CO<U+2082> storage, Germany, has been carried out in the present study. For that purpose, history matched reservoir simulation models were coupled with regional-scale hydro-mechanical simulation models. Simulation results reveal maximum vertical displacements of about 6mm at the reservoir top and 4mm at the ground surface. Neither shear nor tensile failure is observed in the hydro-mechanical model at the end of the simulation time. Consequently, reservoir, caprock and fault integrity are maintained during the entire CO<U+2082> storage operation.
1. Introduction
The Ketzin pilot site is located about 40 km west of Berlin in the State of Brandenburg (Germany) settled in a double-anticline system (Ketzin-Roskow) with a graben zone dominating the double-anticline top. CO<U+2082> injection at the Ketzin pilot site into the Stuttgart Formation (Keuper) is being carried out since June 2008, whereas about 67,270 t CO<U+2082> were injected until site abandonment started in September 2013 (Martens et al. 2013, 2012, Wurdemann et al. 2010). The maximum pore pressure increase during five years of storage operation was about 1.6MPa, while the initial pore pressure at reservoir depth (about 640 m) in the injection well was 6.2MPa (Moller et al. 2012). 
A verification of mechanical caprock and fault integrity was undertaken in the scope of a risk assessment prior to the injection start. At that time, data on site behaviour resulting from CO<U+2082> injection was not available. New data from site operation, geological modelling (Norden & Frykman 2013, Kempka et al. 2013a) and history matched multi-phase flow simulations (Kempka &0 Kuhn 2013, Kempka et al. 2010) were integrated into our 3D hydro-mechanical simulations based on a 40 km<U+00D7>40 km 3D structural geological model taking into account all 24 known major faults in that area. The main aim of the present study was to determine, if reservoir rock, caprock or fault integrity may be compromised by the CO<U+2082> storage operation in addition to a verification of vertical displacements at the ground surface for a later model validation against satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitoring results.|","Document Type

Appropriate rock characterization is vital to many oil and gas exploration and exploitation processes. Robust sub-surface models require input data that represent the rocks involved. This paper describes a method for qualifying and integrating physical and mechanical rock property data to assure they provide reliable inputs to geomechanical models. 
Rock property data necessarily come from different sources. Physical samples for laboratory testing are usually limited to a few depths. Lab tests are often costly, replicating in-situ conditions can be difficult or impossible, and results frequently show wide scatter reflecting the rocks inherent depth variability and lateral heterogeneity. Electric logs provide near-continuous data, but rarely direct measurements of rock strength properties. All too often data from different sources are inconsistent, leading to uncertainty in models using those data. 
Eight mechanical, microstructural and physical properties are shown together to give a good characterization of rock strength behavior in ambient and in-situ conditions. These properties are readily accessible but are individually subject to the above uncertainties. Appropriate data quality assurance and quality control QA/QC review of these properties values is an essential step in building a representative description of the rock. This paper presents a process for doing this QA/QC review. 
Pairs of property values are cross-plotted and compared with correlations from the literature or previously established with qualified data from related formations. Conformance with those correlations gives confidence in the data, whereas outliers are flagged as questionable. Repeating this process with questionable data crossplotted against other parameters for the same depth highlights the property with the greatest uncertainty. The determination of its value is investigated to locate the source of the inconsistency and hopefully to establish a more reliable value. Where this is not possible, the user has a rational basis for rejecting that property value. |","Document Type

The slow moving slope considered in this study is formed by a long ridge of marly-arenaceous rock mass. The overall displacement is parallel to the ridge direction, which is almost perpendicular to the main river valley. The paper summarizes the results of 20 years monitoring (deformation, rainfall, pore pressure). There is enough evidence to support the interpretation of this slow movement as a continuing shear deformation along clay-rich interbeds. Most of the sliding surface can be considered in residual strength conditions. In the second part of the paper, some hydro-mechanical analyses of the slope are presented. The slope is close to limit equilibrium conditions. The quasi-stationary displacement velocity can be simulated by the Maxwell creep model. Recurrent acceleration phases can be related to rainfall and temporary increases in water level at the toe of the slope.
1. Introduction
The site considered in this study is located in the Chiascio river valley, in the central section of Apennines range (Italy), characterized by large outcrops of the Marnoso-Arenacea formation. 
The estimated volume of the sliding mass is about 18Mm<U+00B3>. The kinematic characters of the movement are essentially those of a planar-sliding, with ongoing creep deformations presumably localized along tectonized clay interbeds. 
Weak interbeds and laminated layers can hardly be detected inside structurally complex formations (DElia et al. 1998), such as flysch deposits and layered limestone formations (Alonso et al. 1993, Hatzor & Levin 1997, Graziani et al. 2009). Their occurrence usually represents a key factor for stability analysis in dam and slope engineering and often has required special investigations (Oberti et al. 1986, Graziani et al. 2012). 
This paper illustrates the field evidence and measurements collected during a 20 years period of geotechnical monitoring of the slope. 
In the second part of the paper, some hydromechanical analyses of the slope are presented. The actual conditions of the slope are compared to plausible limit equilibrium conditions and the influence of pore pressure regime (rainfall and reservoir level) is analyzed. To this aim, elasto-plastic and Maxwell-type creep models in plane strain conditions will be applied.|","Document Type

Azad power plant (500MW) is the second pumped-storage of Iran. It has the deepest (over burden>500 m) power house cavern in the west of country. The power house cavern dimensions are (W<U+00D7>H<U+00D7>L) 26.1<U+00D7>46<U+00D7>85 meters. This paper review the main changes between Phase I and Phase II and also explain the effect of inter layer phyllite in the hydro fracturing test which is trapped HF probe and surprising picture of TV logger. The dip direction of bedding from surface to underground changed about 38 degrees. It caused to modified caverns azimuth and rotating caverns complexes around pressure shaft axis as a project fix point. This rotation changed project layout, but fortunately caverns complexes remain at meta-sandstone boundary limit. 
1. Introduction
Azad pumped-storage power plant with 500Mw capacity is located in west of Iran. The power house, transformer cavern and surge tanks are the main underground spaces at this project (Fig. 1). 
Main cavern is located in meta-sandstone zone (Sanandaj-Sirjan formation) and power house axis azimuth was N48E according bedding dip direction at the surface which is 500 meters above caverns (Fig. 2). 
Azad pumped-storage power plant is under construction at altitude between 1357 and 1901 m.a.s.l. and Powerhouse cavern (PHC) and transformer cavern (TC) were at different elevation at Phase I and gate chamber was separate from PHC (Fig. 3). 
During phase II, some access tunnel with about 1000 meters long and four long boreholes with about 1200 meters long executed. Also some hydro fracturing (HF) and hydro jacking (HTPF) tests as a part of in-situ test plan were done. Geological, Geotechnical and geomechanical data emphasis that the caverns azimuth need to be revise. Changing vertical bus bars to horizontal, lowering transformer cavern level, increasing horizontal distance between PHC and TC, transfer gate from gate chamber to inside of PHC, decrease TCs high and increase TCs length, increasing surge tank from one to three, are the main modifications between Phase I and II.

Interactions between well cements and CO<U+2082>-bearing water may trigger changes on the permeability of the well-wall, which would affect the safe of the storage in geo-sequestration contexts. In this work we present experimental results associated with the assessment of the permeability of cylindrical mortar plugs made with ordinary portland cement (OPC) and siliceous aggregate fabricated with different water/cement (W/C) ratios. Tests were performed in a triaxial (Hassler-type) cell under hydrostatic conditions and constant temperature and effective pressure. Because the intrinsic permeability of mortar is low (<5µD or <5 · 10-14 cm<U+00B2>), steady state methods imply long experimental determinations. Transient-state techniques provide with a workable alternative allowing faster determinations. Here we evaluate three transient state methods: the pulse decay (PDM), the pore-pressure transmission (PPTM) and the pore-pressure oscillation (PPOM) methods which are compared with the conventional steady state method (SSM). This allows the assessment of their comparative performance both in terms of reproducibility and speed.
1. Introduction
The safe long-term storage of CO<U+2082> in geological formations requires the assessment of different engineering elements including, among them, well cements. This is a key element that prevents the leakage of the injected CO<U+2082> and the efficient sealing of injection or abandoned wells. CO<U+2082>, in the presence of water and under repository conditions is an acidic reactive fluid that may consume the alkaline reserve of cementitious materials promoting damages potentially leading to problems of leakage, casing corrosion and wellbore stability. Different researchers have suggested that the interaction between well cement and CO2- bearing water may result in either an increase or a decrease in its permeability (Kutchko et al., 2009; Newell and Carey, 2013). Therefore, the assessment of permeability of well cements constitutes a relevant research topic especially when considering the induced reactivity associated to certain fluids. 
Because the intrinsic permeability of mortar is low, steady state methods for permeability determination is not of practical application due to the long duration of the determinations. For these low permeability materials, a number of alternative transient-state techniques there exists: pulse decay (PDM); pore-pressure transmission (PPTM); and pore pressure oscillation (PPOM) methods have been explored and compared with the steady state method (SSM) in order to assess their comparative performance both in terms of reproducibility and speed.|","Document Type

In low-permeability and low-porosity reservoirs, oil is trapped in the rock and cannot be extracted by conventional recovery. In this case, well stimulation techniques such as fracturing can be used to increase the permeability of the rock. One way of well stimulation is matrix acidizing. In matrix acidizing, acid is injected into the rock and reacts with it, etching the wall of its pores, and creating channels called wormholes. Wormholes increase surface area and allow more fluid to drain to the well-bore, enhancing oil recovery. While acidizing increases oil production and recovery, it also increases the risk of rock collapse, especially wormhole walls.
It is therefore important to predict the contrasting effects of increased production rate and decreased rock strength due to wormhole formation. For this reason an integrated model adapted for computer simulation is developed to investigate the multi-physical effect of acid injection in chalk reservoirs. The geometry for the numerical simulation is based on a previously published experimental work. Numerical simulation is based on control volume methods for fluid flow in porous media using a Darcy model, and stress analysis is based on the finite element method using a constitutive model of chalk. For computational simulation of this multiphysics simulation an in-house CFD-FEM (Computational Fluid Dynamics-Finite Element Methods) software, Brilliant, is used. In this work, the mechanical stability of wormholes and chalk sample under uniaxial compaction load are investigated and are compared with an intact chalk. In presence of wormholes, wormhole walls are subject to shear failure, while the same places on the intact rock will fail by pore collapse at higher stresses.
1. Introduction
Oil consumption in the world is going to increase dramatically while oil supply is rapidly declining; as the easy oil reservoirs deplete, oil prices are bound to increase. 
In low-permeability and low-porosity reservoirs, oil is trapped in the rock and cannot be extracted by primary recovery. In this case, well stimulation techniques such as fracturing are used to increase the permeability of the rock. Two ways of well stimulation are fracturing and matrix acidizing. 
In fracturing stimulation, fluid is injected at higher pressure than the reservoir pressure. The high pressure in the reservoir generates new channels. In matrix acidizing, acid is injected into and reacts with the rock, dissolving portions of the rock and opening up existing spaces, resulting in an easier pattern for oil to flow. This allows more fluid to drain to the well-bore and enhances oil recovery. |","Document Type

The injection of CO<U+2082> into a reservoir can influence the initial stress state significantly due to changes in pore pressures. As a result, the integrity of the cap rock can be affected and existing faults may be reactivated. To predict and prevent such negative impacts a risk assessment is needed. This paper deals exclusively with the geomechanical module of the CO<U+2082> RINA project. The aim of this project is to develop a general integrative risk assessment approach for the storage of CO<U+2082> in geological formation. First numerical geomechanical simulations of 25 scenarios show the influence of the flowing liquids density, its dynamic viscosity and the intrinsic permeabilities of the reservoir and the fault on the hydraulic aperture of a fault. The maximum hydraulic aperture has been determined between 1.4 and 3.4 mm.
1. Introduction
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a promising option to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. With this technology CO<U+2082> is separated from the exhaust of power plants and deposited in deep geological formations. Apart from the storage in exploited gas and petroleum reservoirs, one option is the usage of saline aquifers. The reservoir formation has to consist of rock material with a high permeability and a high porosity to ensure a high storage capacity. To seal the reservoir and to prevent a discharge of CO<U+2082>, the reservoir has to be overlaid with a cap rock of low permeability. 
The injection of CO<U+2082> into a reservoir influences the initial stress state significantly. Due to this change, the integrity of the cap rock can be influenced negatively and existing faults may be reactivated. Beside these geomechanical processes a multitude of processesmay occur, e.g. advective or diffusive migration of CO<U+2082> through porous media. 
To predict and prevent such negative effects, a risk assessment is needed, which up to now is mainly based on expert knowledge. Features, events and processes (FEPs),which may have an impact on the safety of CCS, are investigated only for single scenarios in detail. For example Oldenburg (2007) suggests a spreadsheet analysis in which relevant parameters are multiplied by factors of significance and reliability. Oladyshkin et al. (2009) conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation for single scenarios based on a reduction of his model. Due to subjectivity and/or time-consuming and complex fully coupled analyses of single scenarios, a generally accepted risk assessment analysis does currently not exist.|","Document Type

This work addresses the rock matrix strength comparative analysis on rocky coasts. A coastal geoengineering integrated system for rocky coast assessment was proposed and applied in two fissured granitic key-sites in NW Iberia (NW Portugal, and Galicia). The main stages of the study comprise six steps: (i) high resolution aerial imagery survey; (ii) visual inspection and systematic monitoring; (iii) applied field datasheet; (iv) in situ evaluation; (v) scanline survey; (vi) coastal geosciences engineering GIS based mapping. The Schmidt Hammer and Equotip tester were applied to measure the rebound and hardness, respectively, in rocky platforms, geoforms and coastal boulders. Moreover a detailed description of discontinuities and a geologic-geotechnical evaluation in the rocky platforms was performed. The current rock project is of great interest especially to highly dynamic coastal areas. This approach evolving geomorphic processes, geoengineering issues and geomechanical testing assessment contributes to support coastal management/planning.
1. Introduction
The coast comprises a complicated and dynamic transition between the marine environment and the terrestrial environment (Davis 2002). It also includes a wide range of areas, topographies, and geologic settings (Trenhaile 2002, Woodroffe 2003, Bird 2008). Along many coastal areas, this boundary is defined by the so-called rocky coasts (e.g. Sunamura 1992, Trenhaile 2002, Naylor et al. 2010, Trenhaile 2011, Perez-Alberti et al. 2012, Stephenson et al. 2013). The designation rocky coast is currently used to refer to coasts that have fissured rocky substrates in the form of shore platforms with or without coastal boulders (i.e., rock blocks) (e.g., Trenhaile 2002, Nott 2003, Perez-Alberti et al. 2012). This work is primarily concerned with the methodological approach to assess the rock strength  rebound values (R) and hardness values (HDL)  already applied by several authors in different approaches (e.g., Verwaal & Mulder 1993, Kahraman 2001, Kahraman et al. 2002, Aydin & Basu 2005, Aydin 2009, Pires et al. 2009a, Proceq 2012, Pires et al. 2013). Likewise essential in this study were the coastal processes operating on rocky coasts (dynamics and forcing conditions), as well as the geostructural features (e.g. geology, geomorphology, tectonics) and geomechanical evaluation that are mentioned and discussed. The main objective of this study is to propose an integrative coastal geoengineering approach for the geomechanical testing assessment in rocky coasts applied in different coastal environments with diverse perspectives.|","Document Type

A proposed Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Waste beneath the Bruce nuclear site, near Kincardine, Ontario, is currently under-going an Environmental Assessment. The site is underlain by an 840 m thick near-horizontally bedded Paleozoic sedimentary sequence. Within this sequence the DGR has been positioned within a massive, laterally extensive, low permeability Ordovician argillaceous limestone formation at a depth of 680 m. Several hundred metres of massive shales overlie the repository and will act as a vertical cap, although two shafts must penetrate this shale enroute to the repository horizon. In support of mechanical analysis and other studies, an extensive program of investigation was undertaken to obtain material properties for the various layers to be encountered and to provide boundary conditions for analysis. Analysis of long-term stability has been carried out for the shaft, the main storage caverns and intervening pillars over a time frame up to one million years as influenced by glaciation, gas and pore pressure evolution, seismic disturbance and long term strength degradation.
1. Introduction
Ontario Power Generation (OPG), has proposed the development of a Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) at a depth of 680m at the southern base of the Bruce Peninsula near Kincardine, Ontario. This facility will be used for long-term management of Low (LLW) and Intermediate (ILW) Level Waste generated at OPG owned and operated nuclear facilities. The DGR would be developed in an argillaceous limestone overlain by 200m of very low permeability shale protecting the upper 480mof mixed sedimentary rock units and their aquifers. The DGR layout is shown in Figure 1 with the two shafts that will connect to surface. There is a network of service excavations as shown at the shaft station from which main tunnels extend to the main emplacement rooms. Across section between adjacent emplacement rooms is shown, as well as a schematic representation of the waste emplacement. 
The waste will be placed without backfill to allow room for gas expansion during decomposition. The near-shaft service areas will be backfilled and sealed after the operating period of 100 years. The shaft seal design will provide an integrated engineered sealing system intent on mitigating the influence of damaged wall rock or the Excavation Damage Zone (EDZ) as a potential pathway for mass transport.|","Document Type

Fully grouted cable bolts are widely used in underground excavations as a means of reinforcement to the surrounding rock mass and are regarded as one of the primary supporting tendons especially in deep and highly stressed rock conditions. Despite improvements in design over the past 40 years of cable bolting systems, slippage along the cable/grout interface is still a significant issue as it has an adverse impact on the load transfer between rock mass and cable bolts. In order to better understand this issue, a review was undertaken of previous theoretical analysis models of the load transfer mechanics. The results of this study are outlined in this paper highlighting the deficiencies as well as the range of application for each model. Based on those constitutive models, the influence of relevant factors on the bearing capacity and stiffness of cables such as grout quality and borehole diameter are described. Furthermore, since theories in rock joints are always adopted by researchers to study the behaviour of cable/grout interface, the similarities and differences between them are discussed. According to these analytical models, reasons for different performances of standard and modified cable bolts together with two different bond failure modes are concluded. Finally, the authors indicate the gap in knowledge that needs to be focused in the future.
Introduction
Fully grouted cable bolts have been used in the mining and underground construction industries for more than forty years. With long tendon length compared to rock bolts they are effective in anchoring deep into rock mass and reinforcing large rock blocks by increasing the rock internal strength and preventing bed separation from occurring. Although there has been a dramatic increase in the use of cable bolts in underground mines, some incidents near the cable bolting area still happen; for instance, the falling of large rock blocks, which is led by the failure of cable bolt supports, especially the relative movement along the cable/grout interface (Hutchinson & Diederichs, 1996). This is related to the generic area of a load transfer issue and demanding modifications on the design of cables. 
The engineering design of cable reinforcing is primarily dependent on load-displacement curves of strands, which are obtained from pull-out experiments on grouted cables. Since cables were introduced into mining, numerous laboratory and field tests have been conducted. Cox & Fuller (1977) conducted splitpipe pull tests on cables, suggesting that light rust on the strand could improve the bearing capacity of cables. Stillborg (1984) performed long embedment length pull tests, discovering that an increased embedded length resulted in a larger pull force. Beyond that, Maloney et al. (1992) undertook field tests and concluded that stress change evoked by mining resulted in bad performance of traditional strands. According to Satola & Aromaa (2003), who carried out double embedment length pull tests, the corrosion coating on the strand increased the bearing capacity. This was followed by Thomas (2012), who accomplished laboratory short encapsulation pull tests on nutcaged cables with results that the nutcage geometry improved the stiffness of cables up to two orders of magnitudes. These tests are successful in understanding the behavior of grouted cable bolts and helping engineers to modify relevant parameters in practice to improve the load transfer efficiency of strands.|","Document Type

This paper presents the stabilization of a high slope on the road to Cotobello (Aller, Asturias), using wire mesh steel DELTAX® high strength bolts anchored assets. 
Flexible systems for slope stabilization are used with great success in Spain since the 90s of last century, promoting the continuous development of this technique and manufacture of systems to ensure sustainability pressures up to 140 kN/m<U+00B2>. 
The great benefits of these systems are their high landscape integration and not having any influence on the natural drainage of the slope and also its lightness in relation to the high support offered. 
1. Introduction
The promoter of the work was the General Board of Roads of the Government of the Principality of Asturias (Direccion General de Carreteras del Gobierno del Principado deAsturias),which contracted the work of execution to the company New Construction, SL. Geobrugg Iberica SAU acted as a subcontractor of New Construction for the execution of the installation work of mesh of high elastic limit DELTAX® required for the stabilization of a landslide occurred in the access road to Cotobello, in the Council of Aller (Asturias). The rest of work units were executed directly by New Construction. 
In the area of road landslide runs parallel to the Regional Network AS-112 Corredor del Aller, from Ujo to Cabanaquinta, which was affected by the landslide and it had to be closed to traffic while the work lasted. 
The dismount is dug in materials of the Upper Carboniferous, basically whiteboards with collations of sandstone, limestone and coal. 
The study of stability concluded in the need to install a system of flexible stabilization in great part of the slope, as well as the construction of a wall anchored at the top of the slide to contain the lands that formed the top cover of the hillside. The article focuses on the dimensioning of the flexible system without getting into. 
The starting point for sizing of the mesh is precisely the pressure of sustaining that must be ensured in the slope. The goal of this work is not to analyze the conditions of stability or the calculations to determine this.|","Document Type

Rockbursts are associated with a sudden release of strain energy within a rock mass that can usually result in damage to an underground excavation. Often these are violent events that occur unexpectedly, causing disruption to mining operations and can have fatal consequences. The probability of a rockbursts incident increases with mining depth and increasing in situ stress conditions. As mining operations venture to greater depths, engineers will be faced with the challenge of designing effective ground support systems that are able to withstand these dynamic loading conditions. This paper reviews studies related to ground support schemes with a particular emphasis on dynamic loading testing techniques, including rockbolts, mesh, shotcrete and thin spray-on liners. The majority of research was found to have focused on single support element under axial loading conditions. In reality there is usually an element of shear failure with sliding along discontinuities in a rock mass. Moreover traditional design of ground support is often based on the axial capacity of elements such as rock bolts that neglect their shear capacity. This paper concludes that there is a gap in the knowledge on understanding the dynamic shear capacity of support systems, and the contribution of shear resistance of rock support systems in energy absorption.
1. Introduction
Rockburst is defined as  damage to an excavation that occurs in a sudden or violent manner and is associated with a seismic event (Kaiser, 1995). Deep hard rock mining is confronted with a higher risk of rockburst and mining-induced seismicity due to high stress and developed rock structure. For some time, mining in South Africa has occurred at depths in excess of 3 km below surface, while some Canadian mines are operating at depths exceeding 2 km. In other countries such as India, Sweden and China, mining commonly occurs at depths in excess of 1 km, while in Australia the deepest hard rock mine is at 1.8 km at Mount Isa (Li et al. 2001). As a result of mining at these ever increasing depths, rockbursts will become an increasing challenge that needs to be overcome in order to ensure the stability and safety of mining operations. 
Dynamic loading is often associated with mining induced seismicity, and usually consists of repeated discrete events of different magnitude and location (Potvin et al. 2010). This creates challenges in quantifying the demand placed on complete support systems and single support elements. The uncertainty and randomness of seismic events increases the difficulty of designing effective ground support systems.|","dynamic loading,  rockburst,  capacity, Ground support system,  demand"

We study the face stability of rock tunnels excavated by the drill and blast method, using an advanced failure mechanism in the framework of limit analysis. First, we study the influence of the geometry of the section and of the excavation process on the stability of the face, comparing a horseshoe section carried out in several stages with its equivalent circular section. Second, we investigate the influence on the collapse pressure of the damage induced in the rock mass during blasting, characterized by the Blast Damage Factor D. Results show that, as expected, multi-stage excavation sequences increase the stability of the face and that decreasing the height of the top-heading reduces the collapse pressure. Moreover, there is evident influence of the disturbance factor D on the collapse pressure, so that poor quality blasting can facilitate the collapse of the face.
1. Introduction
Tunnel face stability is a big concern in tunneling excavated in soils or soft rock masses, because it is the source of many collapses. For tunneling in soils, it is common to employ EPB or Slurry TBM, whereas excavation methods without face support and with great cross sections are often used in rock masses, increasing the risk of face collapse. 
One method to study tunnel face stability is to assess the collapse pressure (or critical collapse). It is the minimum pressure that needs to be applied at the tunnel face to avoid its instability. Many authors have studied this problem through laboratory test (e.g. Chen et al. (2013)), theoretical analysis (e.g. Leca & Dormieux (1990)) or numerical models (e.g. Vermeer et al. (2002)). 
Limit analysis is another methodology to obtain the collapse pressure. Research on limit analysis has focused on improving failure geometries so that they become more similar to reality (e.g. Oberle (1996) or Soubra (2000)). Recent works (e.g. Mollon et al. (2011a)) proposed collapse mechanisms generated point-to-point that affect the whole excavation front, providing good results when they are compared to numerical solutions and laboratory tests. 
Senent et al. (2013) generalized such failure mechanism, in the framework of limit analysis, for tunnels excavated in low quality rock masses that follow the non-linear HoekBrown failure criterion. But this previous work was focused on TBM excavated tunnels, characterized by a circular section bored by a full face machine. For that reason, they did not consider the disturbance in the rock mass around the tunnel due to the excavation process.|","Document Type

This paper addresses the performance analysis of an optimization algorithm from the field of evolutionary computation, namely an Evolution Strategy, in back analysis to evaluate the geomechanical parameters of the formation surrounding an underground structure. The algorithm is first tested using a synthetic case of a tunnel excavation. In this case, different scenarios are considered through a parametric study. Then the algorithm is tested using real data from the excavation of an underground structure built in the North of Portugal using a 3D model. The results show that the Evolution Strategy algorithm is robust in the identification of geomechanical parameters related to underground engineering.
1. Introduction
In back analysis, field measurements are used together with models to calibrate input parameters (geomechanical, stress state, etc) matching, under a defined tolerance, predicted with observed measures. Normally, an iterative procedure is needed to find the best set of parameters through the minimization of an error function that measures the difference between real and computed quantities. For the minimization task optimization algorithms are used and this is a main issue to obtain the best set of parameters. 
In geotechnics, two main types of algorithms have been used in back analysis: algorithms from the field of classical optimization theory such as the Simplex, the Newton-Raphson or gradient methods; and Evolutionary optimization algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Evolution Strategies (ES), Simulated Annealing, etc. (Moreira et al., 2013). 
Classical algorithms present a satisfactory performance in smooth-shaped error functions, with a clearly defined and unique minimum (Miranda, 2007). However, the error function topology is normally complex and the uniqueness of the solution cannot be guaranteed since many local minima may occur. Hence, this kind of algorithms are most of the times limited to simpler models and a reduced number of parameters to identify (Moreira et al., 2013).|","Document Type

Z., North China Electric Power University| Zhang, N., North China Electric Power University| Chen, H. Y., North China Electric Power University| Qin, Y., North China Electric Power University| Zhang, L. Q., Chinese Academy of Sciences","|Abstract
Based on the plane elastic complex function method, theoretical analysis on the stress field around a circular tunnel with ring lining subjected to in situ stresses and inner hydrostatic pressure is carried out. The results of two extreme boundary conditions cases, pure slip and pure bond, are compared with each other. The displacement release coefficient is considered. The calculation results show that the magnitude of the deformation completed before lining installation has great effects on the stress distribution in the lining. If the lining is installed at a proper moment, the degree of stress concentration in the lining can be minimized. When the Youngs modulus of the lining is much lower than that of the rock, stress solutions for two extreme boundary condition cases are roughly the same. The smaller the lateral pressure coefficient <U+03BB>, the larger the differences between the corresponding stress solutions for two extreme boundary condition cases.
1. Introduction
Underground tunnels are widely used in hydropower, traffic, mining and military engineering to ensure the tunnel safety, lining is applied in the tunnel. The closed-form solutions for unsupported tunnel at great depth have been proposed for single circular tunnel (Kirsch 1898, Hefny 1999) and tunnels with complex geometry, such as elliptic tunnel, rectangular tunnel, semi-circular tunnel, inverted U-shaped tunnel and notched circular openings (Lu & Zhang 2007). The complex function method developed by Muskhelishvili (1963) is especially suitable for solving underground tunnel problems. The complex function method can be applied to find the stress solutions not only for single tunnel in arbitrary shape, but also for multiple tunnels with arbitrary shape (Lu & Zhang 1997, Zhang et al. 2001). 
As for elastic solutions for deep supported tunnels, the plane strain problem associated with a single circular tunnel with ring lining in an infinite domain has been studied in depth (Bulychev 1982, Lu et al. 2011). Theoretically, the solutions based on plane strain can only be applicable to the situation that lining is applied immediately after excavation and no deformation occurs in the surrounding rock mass before that. In fact, after the tunnel is excavated by a certain length and before the lining is applied, some deformation has occurred in the surrounding rock mass. After lining installation, as the working face is advanced, the surrounding rock mass experiences further deformation and leads to forces on the lining. Although the support delay process was considered by Bulychev (1982) and Wang & Li (2009), some limitations still exist (Lu et al. 2011).|","Document Type

The paper is a case study of a slope stability of deep excavation. The rock mass subsoil is composed of jointed sandstone with a weaker interbedding of a claystone. This layer is inclined toward the slope of approximately 12 degrees. During the excavation works the failure has occurred. After that event, the authors have performed the study involving back analysis. Two circumstances were quite evident and should have been accounted. The failure took place after prolonged heavy rainfalls. Furthermore, a contractor has changed a technology of excavation during the construction. The solution proposed in original design comprised of vertical sprayed concrete wall and soil nailing. Nevertheless, an alternative solution, i.e. an open excavation has been executed. Thus, back analysis in this case is not only identification of actual strength parameters of subgrade but also the assessment of executed technology: particularly risk management problem. Based on observations made in the construction site after the failure occurrence, the failure mode has been diagnosed as localized slip over interbedding plane at the interface. A relatively simple method for determining the failure probability has been proposed in the paper. Since the failure mode has been identified, the parameters determining the failure are the strength parameters of contact zone between the sandstone and claystone interbedding. The Coulomb-Mohr condition for an interface is assumed with the strength parameters c and <U+03C6> becoming random variables within the analysis. Since no information on the probability distribution of these variables is available, the uniform distribution is assumed. The range of values of the variables is limited by the parameters of the weaker of contacting layers. Taking such assumptions lead to a simple method of calculating probability of failure that has clear geometrical interpretation. Namely the probability is equal a quotient of the area corresponding to the failure (factor of safety FOS(<U+03C6>,c)<1) and the area corresponding to the sample space in Cartesian product c <U+00D7> <U+03C6>. The failure area is determined numerically based on the condition FOS(<U+03C6>, c)<1. The Itasca Flac code has been utilized to evaluate the course of boundary between the failure and reliability areas, namely the curve corresponding to FOS(<U+03C6>, c)=1. A series of numerical calculation allowed finally evaluating the probability of failure occurrence.|","Document Type

The Artificial Ground Freezing method (AGF) has been widely used for both civil engineering and mining applications for ground stabilization and water control. In AGF models, the thermal boundary conditions at the freeze pipe wall strongly depend on the cooling conditions and on the heat transfer between the pipe and the ground. These boundary conditions are generally determined based on in situ measurements, which are not readily available. This paper presents a new approach where coupling between the thermal problem in the pipe and in the surrounding ground is numerically modeled. Parametric studies highlight the influence of the operating conditions. Finally, the interest of the proposed new approach is twofold: (i) it implicitly determines the boundary conditions of the AGF model and (ii) it enables an optimization of the cooling conditions for freeze pipes.
1. Introduction
The artificial ground freezing technique (AGF) appeared 150 years ago in South Wales for shaft sinking in coal mines. Nowadays, it is particularly widespread in civil engineering (tunneling, landslide stabilization, underpinning), mining engineering (shaft sinking) and environmental engineering (containment of hazardous waste) (Andersland 2004). The advantages of this technique are to reduce the ground permeability, which mitigates water seepage and in flow into underground workings, and to improve the mechanical properties (strength and stiffness) of the ground and thus to increase the stability of future excavations. 
The principle of AGF is to circulate a fluid coolant through a pipe network in the ground to be frozen. As it flows in the pipes, the refrigerant extracts heat from the surrounding ground and pore liquid water gradually turns into ice. The quantity of extracted heat depends on the cooling conditions. Therefore, an estimation of the temperature distribution in the ground would require an understanding of the thermal processes which occur inside the freeze pipes. In common AGF numerical models, the thermal boundary conditions at the freeze pipe wall are based on external data defined from in situ measurements. However these data, whether they be expressed in temperature or flux, are not readily available.|","Document Type

J., YieldPoint Inc.","|Abstract
Temporary support for a tunnel excavated in weak rock can involve (but is not limited to) the utilization of a combination of steel-sets, rock bolts, shotcrete, spiles/forepoles and/or face stabilization technologies. The purpose of such tunnel support is to maintain confinement for the rock mass in order to help the rock mass support itself. This research is concerned with the forepoles as components of this system. Within this context, this paper describes a novel application of a distributed optical sensing technique specifically for monitoring the continuous strain profile along forepole elements. The procedure employs a distributed optical sensing technique using optical fiber that is based on Rayleigh backscattering which has been previously employed with grouted rock bolts. The paper outlines the technology, describes how it has been adapted for monitoring of forepoles, and assesses its potential and limitations based on initial laboratory experiments.
1. Introduction
Classical tunnel designs have been based on the Rock Mass Ratio (RMR) (designing with respect to deformations) and Terzaghi based designs (designing primarily to support all loads including overburden pressure by the final lining). A newer tunneling method, such as the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM), incorporates an observational approach that is deformation based. This method integrates the surrounding rock into the overall support structure (i.e. the supporting formations will themselves be a part of the supporting structure as the rock is able to support itself to a certain degree) (Romeo, 2002). Using the NATM, a controlled deformation of the rock mass is permitted (a limited strain of approximately 1%) and this gives the stresses an opportunity to be partly released and less stiff and thus a less-expensive support system can be used (Kondogianni and Stiros, 2002). 
Optimizations of tunnel support design (to include individual support elements, forepoles, shotcrete, rockbolts etc.) can therefore be achieved within the framework of this observational (well instrumented) approach whereby the behaviour of rock/soil, support elements, geomaterial-support interactions, and behaviours can be explicitly determined. Through back-calculations, material properties can be clearly derived. However, there exists a gap in knowledge in terms of the distinct performance of each support element in isolation and its performance as part of a multi component support system. This investigation, then, suggests a strategy in order to determine the continuous behaviour and performance of a forepole temporary support elements as part of the overall temporary support scheme.|","Document Type

A business centers 4-story underground garage in the center of Rijeka, Croatia is under construction. The excavation of an open pit for the underground garage commenced during Spring 2012 and was completed in December 2013. The construction site is located very close to an old shallow railway tunnel constructed in 1870. The tunnel was constructed without any rock mass reinforcement. The excavation pit for the underground garage is located only 6.0m from the side of the existing railway tunnel. The pit excavation had a significant effect on the existing tunnel construction; thus, a reinforcement of the rock mass using rock bolts and multi-layered reinforced sprayed concrete was embedded. In this paper we present a design for pit construction including numerical models and geotechnical analyses. Based on these analyses, a required reinforcement of rock mass around the tunnel and an appropriate support system for the stabilization of pit walls was designed and executed.
Introduction
The construction of new buildings in old urban or built up areas is extremely demanding and, as a rule, conditioned by eliminating or minimizing its influence on surrounding buildings. The existence of empty land in old urban areas indicates that unfavorable geotechnical conditions or other construction problems exist on the site. The presence of surrounding buildings and the limitation of space for construction site organization represent the major problems during the design and construction of new buildings (Arbanas et al. 1994). The lack of necessary space requires urban planners to establish all auxiliary facilities, such as garages, underground. In this paper business centers 4-story underground garage in the center of Rijeka, Croatia and its constructions effect on surrounding buildings and underground facilities will be described and analyzed. The construction site is located near an old shallow railway tunnel. This railway tunnel was constructed in 1870 and is still in use. The tunnel was constructed without any rock mass reinforcement with only 5.0 to 9.0m of overlaying in poor limestone rock mass.|","Document Type

Many tunnels are being designed and/or built according the RMR system, and with convergence control. Bieniawski (1989) proposed guidelines for excavation and support of tunnels, guidelines which have not been modified afterwards. Most of academic and engineering books and/or webs on tunnels reproduce the 1989 guidelines. Conditions for application of those guidelines were: shape: horseshoe; width: 10 m; vertical stress <25MPa; construction: drilling and blasting. A lot of things have changed in tunnel construction from 1989 to the present: tunnels size, construction methods, and safety rules. The paper gives adequate RMR guidelines for excavation and support of actually built tunnels, taking account of these facts.
1. Introduction
Geomechanics Classifications are actually universal. Bieniawski (1997) established the conceptual frame for their adequate use. Rock mass Classifications are most effective (when) used the overall design process. Rock mass classifications  should be used for preliminary, planning purpose and not for final tunnel support. (They) enable effective comparison of predicted conditions from site investigation with those encountered during construction.  After more than 35 years of use in the tunnelling world RMR (and Q) have proved themselves on many projects. Barton & Bieniawski (2008) defined common rules for both classificationsTypefont, typesize and spacing.
2 Bieniawski Tunnel Excavation and Support Guidelines
The (RMR) Geomechanics Classification provides guidelines for the selection of rock reinforcement for tunnels(these) represent the permanent and not the primary support Table 1 is the last version of these guidelines (Bieniawski 1989).
Note that Bieniawski established the conditions of tunnels for application: horsehoe shape; 10m width; vertical stress <25MPa; construction by drilling and blasting. Limitation of the vertical stress is a limitation of tunnel depth to less than ~1 km. The guidelines include the following concepts: 
 Excavation: full face; top heading and bench; multiple drifts, invert. Rock bolts (20mmdiameter, fully grouted): length; spacing; wire mesh use.  Shotcrete: thickness; place of application.  Steel sets: need; rib class; spacing; use of lagging and forepoling.|","Document Type

The Etruscan coast, south of Leghorn (Tuscany, Italy) presents several small pretty beaches closed by cliffs, which are constituted by ophiolitic rock-mass. This paper defines the geostructural and geomechanical setting of this ophiolitic rock-mass and presents a stability analysis of cliffs overhanging the beaches. A regional preliminary analysis led to define the coastal segments that display a high potentiality for rock-fall. In these segments, by means of self-developed GIS tools, were defined the slope-sites which displayed a high kinematic possibility in generating rock-falls. For these sites, trajectories and distances of rock-falls were calculated and probabilistic impact and fall-down areas on the below beaches were defined. The result is a Hazard Zonation of these beaches, which allowed the identification of areas that, in the public interest, should be closed while protective interventions are put in place.
1. Introduction
1.1 The problem
In summer time, the Etruscan coast, south of Leghorn (Tuscany, Italy) along Tyrrhenian Sea, is a crowded touristic beach site. 
Long segments of coast present small pretty beaches closed by overhanging cliffs cut into an ophiolitic rock-mass. Due to their wild beauty these beaches are particularly researched by tourists, therefore they are often very crowded. 
These cliffs are almost sub-vertical, due to the strong marine erosion at their bottom, and they are as well highly weathered due to seawater spraying during sea-storms. 
These cliffs can represent a real hazard for touristic fruition of the beaches because of rock-fall risk endangering the bathers. 
The recently developed EU Research Project PERLA was set up to deal with this problem. 
In the frame of this project it was defined a regional (ISR) and a local (ISL) index of potential instability (Bini et al. 2013). This preliminary approach allowed the definition of coast segments to be further investigated. 
This study analyses in detail one of these segments, right north of Castiglioncello village (Fig. 1).|","Document Type

The right choice of the excavation method is essential in hard rock underground projects. The Drill and Blast (D&B) and Hard Rock Tunnel Boring Method (TBM) are widely and successfully used. Selecting the most appropriate excavation method is not simple as it is depending of several parameters and particular conditions. The purpose of this paper is to make a review of the parameters involved in the selection of proper excavation method. The applicability and level of convenience of each excavation method in function of every parameter defined will be briefly discussed. A final resume of the excavation method comparison is presented and proposed to be general guidelines at the early stages in hard rock tunnelling.
1. Introduction
Underground construction industry has been experiencing a strong development with enormous technological improvement. In hard rock projects, drill and blast excavation method (D&B) and tunnel boring machine method (TBM) are widely used with success. 
In hard rock tunnelling the selection of the excavation method is not a simple issue. It may result in catastrophic situations as experience has shown. 
The choice is more complex than a simple economic issue and rarely clear from the early stages of the projects. It is necessary to have an entire overview of the parameters involved in the excavation method choice. 
Many parameters are involved with different role in every project case; project characteristics and purpose, environmental aspects or even social issues are involved. Every project is unique and a comprehensive and detailed study should be carried out. 
The excavation methods are not mutually exclusive. Hybrid solutions should be considered taking advantage of them whenever circumstances allow (Barton, 2013). 
In the present paper, through a wide literature review, the main parameters involved in the selection of the excavation method are briefly discussed. The extension of the discussion is limited due to the space available on the paper. A further research is considered. 
The existing literature related to the excavation method choice in hard rock tunnelling is normally based on particular cases studied and many subjective statements are done. The discussion has been divided into groups according to the parameters involved in the excavation method choice.|","Document Type

Rock under natural conditions experiences different stress environment and it fails when it crosses its threshold value. Understanding their failure will not lead to determine the strength and deformational characteristics but also will be useful for safe and economic design of structures which are built in rock. To know their mechanism of failure many failure theories have been developed and some of them most commonly used were Mohr-Coulomb and Griffith theories which are found to be applicable for rock. Based on these theories many researchers have done experiments to verify those failure mechanisms when it is been subjected to different stress condition and later extended with some other conditions which influence their behavior in failure. But even though some researchers have found these theories and experiments does not fully capture the complete mechanism of failure and they have their advantages and limitations especially when rock having discontinuities like cracks, joints, flaws, plane of weakness etc present in it. And by considering their limitations recent decades researchers have adopted numerical tool like finite element, finite difference methods to overcome these limitations. The present study focuses on the numerical verification of recently developed failure criterion and implementing it Finite element software ABAQUS to understand their failure mechanism when subjected to uniaxial loading conditions how their existing crack will gets initiated and propagated further ends with failure.
1. Introduction
The nature of the rock is said to be inhomogeneous, anisotropic and inelastic because of the presence of discontinuities such as plane of weakness, cracks, flaws, joints etc. Rock under natural conditions experiences different stress environment. Based on the type of external load configuration and discontinuities present in it, the rock will have different failure modes. When the rock is subjected to higher stresses it fails at a certain point when it crosses the threshold value. Understanding the complete mode of failure will provide useful information for safe and economic design of structures and foundations involving rock. In order to understand the complete failure mechanism of rocks, many researchers have developed theoretical criteria based on experimental observations in accordance with the field. Most of experimental studies have considered rocks as isotropic and intact (unjointed) which is rarely found in nature. Some of the researchers have considered rock as a transversely isotropic and anisotropic material by implementing the numerical tools like finite element method (FEM), finite difference method (FDM), etc. They have verified those failure modes obtained from numerical analysis with the failure modes found from experiments. The present paper is an attempt to understand the different failure modes of brittle natured rock when subjected to compressive stress.|","Document Type

In this paper, Perzyna-type viscoplastic rate equations are integrated for a time step by considering the step as stress-driven. Depending on how the increment is imposed (constant, linear etc.), different strategies arise. The secant compliance is obtained by truncated expansion of the yield function. The viscoplastic model can be applied to materials exhibiting rate-dependent behavior, but it can also be used to recover an inviscid elastoplasticity solution when stationary conditions are reached. Within this framework, a viscoplastic relaxation iterative strategy is developed, relating the iterations with the fictitious time steps. Some examples of application are presented in the context of the Finite Element Method with zero-thickness interface elements for slope and stability problems with discontinuities.
1. Introduction
Viscoplasticity has been widely used for engineering materials with (physical) time-dependent behaviour over a treshold stress level (Cormeau, 1975, Zienkiewicz and Cormeau, 1974), or in the context of viscoplastic relaxation strategies to obtain the stationary solution of an inviscid problem via a fictitious (non-physical) pseudo-time (Underwood, 1983, Zhang and Yu, 1989). In either case, the rate-type infinitesimal viscoplastic formulation requires a time integration strategy to a) discretize time in increments b) evaluate a linearized relation between stress and strain increments for each time step and, possibly, some residual force calculation and iterative strategy. Typically, the algorithms are based on the initial stress scheme used in FEs, in which the strain increments are prescribed to the constitutive equations. A variety of such algorithms has been proposed since the original constant stiffness and constant stress procedures (Hughes and Taylor, 1978, Peirce et al., 1984, Peric, 1993, Simo, 1991) to more recent and sophisticated contributions (Alfano et al., 2001, Betegon et al., 2006, Lorefice et al., 2008, Ponthot, 2002). In contrast, stress driven schemes are not that common (Caballero et al., 2009, Zienkiewicz and Cormeau, 1974). Their implementation can be numerically advantageous (explicit integration of the constitutive equations and simple coding) but their stability is strongly related to the size of the time step and, as a consequence, if a small time step is required an enormous amount of iterations are required.|","Document Type

Some of the main features of the behaviour of strain softening rocks are associated precisely to the strain softening phase of the constitutive law, which can be modelled using data extracted from a (confined) compression test. Nevertheless, some other important aspects are connected to the pre-peak behaviour. For instance, localization phenomena are associated to the pre-peak hardening phase for many rocks. In this paper, using data from a series of confined compression tests, the derivation of a strain-hardening model for the pre-peak stage of a (otherwise) strain-softening rock is considered and the ability of this model to predict localization phenomena is examined.
1. Introduction
Constitutive law modelling of rock masses is usually performed using (servo-controlled) compression test data like those shown in Figure 1 (corresponding to a granite described in section 2). As it is well known, for a rock exhibiting a strain-softening behaviour such curves contain several components. Apart from a first inelastic stretch 00<U+02CA> (associated to the closure of cracks and pores in the sample), the inelastic part of the axial stress-strain curve contains a hardening stretch 0<U+02BA>A, a softening phase AB and, eventually, a residual one BC. 
Experimental and theoretical studies (Rice 1976, Vermeer & de Borst 1984, Vardoulakis et al. 1978, Vardoulakis 1980) show that localization phenomena (such as shear bands) can appear already in the hardening phase (stretch 0<U+02BA>A). From this point on, deformation homogeneity will be lost and stress-strain curve must be critically analyzed.
In this paper, the derivation of a model able to describe the hardening phase using data from a compression tests is considered. The quality of this model will be assessed by comparing its numerical prediction of the stress-strain curves and the localization phenomena with those obtained in compression tests. In particular, the orientation of shear bands given by this model will be compared with those experimentally measured. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 both the analyzed rock and the experimental set-up corresponding to the data set considered in this paper are described. The methodology used in the derivation of the constitutive law from experimental data is presented in Section 3. The results obtained for the data previously described are presented and discussed in Section 4. Finally, some conclusions are included in Section 5.|","Document Type

There are many types of commercial software packages available that can be used to model a dam structure and its underlying jointed rock foundation. In this paper, results are compared between a continuum model (FLAC) and a discontinuum model (UDEC), in order to evaluate which code gives the most realistic prediction. The results of this research are compared with the existing conventional analytical methodology which is based on limit equilibrium theory. It is concluded that both codes give similar results to the conventional theoretical approach as long as the rock foundation blocks are not rotated by the stress regime created by the dam and reservoir. However, this similarity was found to depend on the joint strength. As the joint strength is reduced, UDEC was found to provide a better representation of the behaviour of a jointed system and arguably a more realistic prediction of the stress distribution under the dam.
1. Introduction
The construction of a safe and economic dam requires a detailed understanding of the geotechnical environment in the area surrounding the dam location. Most historical dam failures are related to deficiencies in the dam foundation due to the presence of jointing in the bed rock. 
There are various publications relating to dam incidents, such as ICOLD (1974, 1983, 1995) and Douglas (2002). According to these, about thirty percent of incidents occurred due to some deficiency of the rock foundations. For example the Austain Dam (also known as Byless Dam) failed because of sliding between sandstone and shale layers (Martt et al., 2005) and the Malpasset Dam failure was a result of open joints upstream of the dam and an inactive fault downstream (Jansen, 1988). 
Continuum software packages have been extensively used to analyse and design dams on rock mass, although the rock mass is discrete and its behaviour depends on the joints and the intact rock. One of these packages is FLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua) (Itasca, 2008), which is a 2D explicit finite difference program. Recently the discontinuum approach has gained popularity in geomechanics, especially in mining, tunnelling, and slope stability problems. UDEC (Universal Distinct Element Code) (Itasca, 2011) is a discontinuum software code available for analysing geotechnical problems (Cundall, 1980). UDEC is a 2D distinct element, explicit finite difference program that treats a medium as a collection of discontinuous shapes that interact with each other in space. It is argued that the most powerful tool available to study the rock mass under a dam is the distinct element method because it is capable of modelling the stresses between rock blocks and flow through discontinuities (joints and faults) within the rock mass (Gimenes and Fernandez, 2006; Bretas et al., 2013). It should be noted, however, that FLAC can also model discontinuities using interfaces, but this takes up considerable computational time so its use is limited to a few joints within the rock mass. Also, the flow cannot be modelled through the joint.|","Document Type

The aim of this paper is to examine and compare the results of engineering geological exploration works in the design phase and during the construction of tunnel Strazina. Tunel Strazina is located near the city of Omis on Zagreb-Split-Dubrovnik highway in Croatia. The interactive design method was applied in the tunnel design. This methodology integrates the empirical, rational and observational approaches in the geotechnical design of the tunnel. It allows for the thorough and comprehensive overview and problem solving during the construction. In addition, it minimizes the errors that may occur due to the limitations of each individual approach. Predicted underground excavation support solutions were done based on site investigation activities and other bases using the empirical and rational approaches. Geomechanical and Q classification were performed as a part of the empirical approach. Engineering-geological tunnel mapping was done during the excavation activities as a part of the geotechnical monitoring. Verification of the tunnel support system during the construction phase was done using the actual data obtained from the engineering-geological mapping and the monitoring. Thus, the actual rock mass quality along the tunnel was determined and the tunnel underground excavation support measures were optimized. Due to the complex conditions present in the rock mass, the discrepancy between estimated and actual rock mass conditions can hardly be avoided, and likewise, a certain amount of discrepancy between the predicted and actual support systems is also to be expected. The interaction of site investigation, design and construction, in addition to introducing the risk analysis, is essential for a more rational, safer and more economical construction. Development of methods and procedures for the preparation and control for each of the phases is important for a successful operation of each participant performing a completion of a particular phase, as well as for the project investor.|","Document Type

Mas, ITASCA Consultants AB| Juncal, A. Sanchez, ITASCA Consultants AB","|Abstract|Rock mechanical problems are often governed by the shear strength of joints, but assessing it theoretically is difficult because of the many underlying factors. Consequently, expensive and time-consuming shear tests must be performed either in laboratory or in situ. Artificial shear tests based on numerical models would therefore be a valuable complement. In this paper, results from an initial study on real shear tests are compared with numerically simulated shear tests performed with the computer software PFC2D. The results from the analyses are good from a qualitative view, but also revealed the need for further research. In this paper, the results from the performed analyses are presented and the current limitations and requirements of further development are discussed.
1. Introduction
Rock mechanical problems such as sliding stability of rock slopes, the stability of caverns located in rock, or foundations on rock are in many cases governed by the joints that run through the rock mass. Therefore, it is necessary to gain knowledge about the shear strength of these joints. The shear strength of rock joints is influenced by several factors such as the surface roughness, the compressive strength of the joint surface, the normal stress, the degree of weathering, the matedness, the infilling material, and the scale. This makes it difficult to theoretically determine the shear strength of the joints. Therefore, shear tests are often performed, both in laboratory and in situ. These tests are often expensive and also time consuming. Thus, it would be valuable if artificial shear tests could be performed using numerical models. 
The shearing of rock joints involves both sliding on asperities as well as crushing, shearing and tensile failure. To successfully model this complex behavior, the numerical model must be able to reproduce these failure modes. According to Cundall (2000), using a micro-mechanical model to numerically represent rough rock joints could lead to simulated behavior that is similar to that observed in real joints. Similar observations were also made by Asadi & Rasouli (2010, 2011), who presented an application of the contact bond model for rock joints with symmetric triangular profiles and with irregular rough profiles. They showed PFC2D (Particle Flow Code) is able to numerically reproduce the progressive shear behavior of rough fractures. Park & Song (2009) performed a study in PFC3D using the contact bond model on the relationship between the macro-response of a joint and the micro-parameters. They analyzed the influence on the macro-response by changing the following micro-parameters; the particle size, the joint friction coefficient, the joint roughness and the joint contact bond strength. According to their observations, both the shear behavior and the failure process were successively modelled and corresponded well to those observed in shear tests.|","Document Type

In the present paper, the continuum-mechanics based code RASH3D is used to evidence the influence that three factors can have on results of a numerical analysis. These are 1) the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) resolution; 2) the morphology and substrate influence on the rheology selection; and 3) the role of the entrainment process. The Baio Dora debris flow is back-analysed to this aim. Obtained results have evidenced that a bad quality DEM can make fail all the attempts of selecting the more appropriate rheology and calibrating its parameters. On the other side, the selection of a wrong rheology can give a unrealistic runout path, that is the moving mass can go as far taking a completely incorrect flowing directions. Finally, it is observed that the entrainment of channel path material can change significantly the mobility of a flow, through rapid changes of both the flow volume and rheology.
Introduction
Rapid landslide run-out analysis, that is the prediction of landslide motion and impact on affected areas, is an essential component of landslide risk assessment. Numerical simulation can provide a useful tool for investigating the propagation phase of phenomena involving granular material, like debris flows, debrisand rock-avalanches. In the attempt of modelling landslide dynamics, methods based on discontinuum mechanics (e.g. Will and Konietzky, 1998; Richefeu et al., 2012) and continuum mechanics (e.g., Savage and Hutter, 1989; Pastor et al., 2009) have nowadays emerged as promising approaches. 
Discontinuum methods model the moving mass as an assembly of particles moving down a surface. Each particle is followed as it moves and interacts with the stationary bedrock and with its neighbouring particles (Poisel et al., 2008). 
Continuum methods resort to an equivalent fluid (Hungr 1995), that is a hypothetical material, whose properties do not correspond to those of any of the slide components but are intended to be able to simulate the bulk behaviour of the moving mass. 
The use of these two approaches have advanced incrementally over the past three decades to the point where, when used in combination with careful engineering and geological judgement, first-order run-out prediction appears to be possible. |","Document Type

Uncertainties in the geological and ground models prior to construction lead to a residual risk during construction. As well the ground properties, as the exact location of the single units are not known precisely during the design. In addition, factors influencing the ground and system behavior, like ground stresses and ground water conditions can be estimated only in this stage. The consequence is a residual risk during construction. To minimize the risk, an observational approach is required. This involves sound preparation during design, and special procedures to be followed during construction. Part of these procedures is the geotechnical safety management, which will be presented in this paper.
1. Introduction
The inherent uncertainties in the geological and ground models do not allow a precise prediction of the ground and behavior prior to construction. The associated residual risk has to be managed during construction by applying an observational approach. This includes assessing the possible range of behaviors during design, assigning appropriate construction measures to the ground behaviors under consideration of the requirements, and development of a monitoring program, which can capture the expected system behaviors. For managing the risks during construction a so called geotechnical safety management plan has to be established. The plan includes a listing of safety relevant issues for each section, predicted behavior, as well as limits of acceptable behavior in the form of warning and alarm criteria. In addition actions to be taken in case of reaching one of the warning or alarm criteria have to be specified, as well as the responsibilities clearly defined. An essential part of the safety management during construction is the implementation of an up to date monitoring program, as well as advanced evaluation and interpretation of the measurement data. An important role in the safety management plays the prediction of ground structure and expected behavior ahead of the face. This allows timely adjustment of the construction, and continuous comparison of the observed behavior with the predicted.|","Document Type

The diametric deformation of a tunnel (the ratio of tunnel wall displacement vs. tunnel radius) is a very useful parameter to analyze its tenso-deformational behavior. In this paper we present a new methodology for use it as monitoring variable to assess tunnel stability. It has obtained an analytical expression useful to obtain the diametric deformation from tape extensometer convergence measures. A procedure to analyze the diametric deformation is proposed. A practical example is carried out.
1. Introduction
Typically, the measurement of convergences is the principal monitoring method for tunnels excavated in rock. The convergence is measured with a tape extensometer, and it is a straightforward, simple, fast and cheap method that it does not require the installation of sophisticated instrumental devices or indirect measurement. Furthermore, the measuring interferes very little in the construction of the tunnel. All these advantages allow the installation of a large number of benchmarks along the tunnel, which is an additional advantage, because the heterogeneous behavior that usually shows a rock mass. 
However, like the rest of tunnel monitoring methods is always difficult to perform an analysis of the measurements obtained, especially if the number of data is large. The tunnel geomechanical monitoring should always tries to evaluate whether the measures indicate the existence of instabilities, if it is required the reinforcement of the support or whether they indicate the stabilization of the tunnel. 
Usually convergence analysis provides a good evaluation of the degree of stabilization that a tunnel has reached. On the other hand, does not always provide a good indication of the state of charge of support or the existence of deformational instabilities. Often it is not easily transpose the results obtained by numerical methods to measure movements; these movements will depend on where the convergences rings are installed.|","Document Type

R., University of Vigo| Ferrero, A. M., Universita degli Studi di Torino","|Abstract
One of the most relevant problems when modeling rock masses derives from the fact that rock masses are natural materials, so their physical and mechanical features have to be assessed with the help of non-straight- forward experimental procedures and cannot be a priori accurately defined as it can be the case for other construction materials. Rock masses are discontinuous, heterogeneous, anisotropic, non-elastic, scale-affected, complex materials. In the 80s Hoek & Brown proposed and later refined a procedure to homogenize rock mass behavior and derive equivalent continua properties of rock masses, but this approach is not suitable in all cases. The choice to model a rock mass as continuous or discontinuous is usually made in the light of the jointing of the rock mass, for instance comparing the average joint spacing or blocksize in the rock mass to the span of the underground excavation. To further study the appropriateness of the approach in this work we have carried out a comparison of continuous and discontinuous models of tunnels in 6 types of rock masses of growing geotechnical quality by means of standard codes FLAC and UDEC, following the development by Ferrero et al. (2004). In these models stresses and displacement distribution have been compared to analyses the representativeness of the derived stress-strain behavior around excavations by means of continuous and discontinuous approaches.
1. Introduction
Rock masses can be often considered as a discrete medium due to the pervasive occurrence of joints and other of discontinuities of different nature and origin. Discontinuities usually control the mechanical behavior of rock masses, particularly in comparison to most other engineering materials; so they could largely influence the choice of modelling scheme to be adopted for any design approach. Discontinuities can be considered in an explicit way by adopting a discontinuous approach or in an implicit way by using an equivalent continuous approach (Jing 2003). 
Among the methods involving a continuous medium scheme, and with specific reference to domain methods, mostly Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Methods (FDM) are applied. Within these methods, the discontinuity presence is considered in an implicit way (equivalent continuum).|","Document Type

S., Queens University; Royal Military College","|Abstract
It has been empirically proven that the correct installation of an Umbrella Arch (UA) temporary support system reduces the surface settlement in shallow tunnel operations. The UA is a tunnel pre-support system that provides reinforcement through the interaction of support elements of the UA and the ground. It is installed during the excavation process at the face of the tunnel, above and around the crown. This paper summarizes the results of numerical analyses regarding the effect on surface settlement in which UA support was employed utilizing various tunnel excavation methods. The analyses employed the UA and included variances in terms of geometry (Horseshoe and Circular geometries) as well as variations in terms of staged excavation, i.e. partial and full face excavation techniques. Additionally investigated was the effect of the overlap of successive UA support regimes. All of these variations were carried out in an effort to further understand the impact of the UA on surface settlement.
Introduction
Whendesigning a tunnel in shallow ground conditions, it can be difficult to create and analyze an economical and optimized support scheme. Historically, due to computational limitations, analyses have required two-dimensional simplification. However, such simplification cannot mechanistically capture the effect of the Umbrella Arch (UA) systems (Oke et al. 2012a). An UA is a pre-support method (or auxiliary method, (Kimura et al. 2005)) that is installed horizontally (38° off the tunnel axis) during the first pass of excavation from within the tunnel, above and around the crown of the tunnel face (Oke et al. 2014). Therefore, three-dimensional (3D) analysis is required to capture the mechanistic response of the longitudinal redistribution of the radial displacement acting on the UA. 3D analysis, however, requires extensive calibration of the interaction parameters (Oke et al. 2013). 
In order to gain confidence in a numerical model created to simulate/analyze an UA, the designer can conduct a parametric analysis of the relevant interaction parameters. Once a design is chosen (i.e. overlap of the UA, spacing between UA elements, and stiffness of UA etc. have been determined) it can be compared to the results to the Umbrella Arch Selection Chart (Oke et al. 2014) subsidence management plot (Fig. 1) in order to provide the designer with further confidence of the support design or numerical analysis. Figure 1 was empirically and numerically driven, from a large body of publications and can provide an expected amount of surface reduction based on the employment of different UA systems. For this paper, the authors have created a numerical model that is based on one of the empirical case studies, a section of the Istanbul Metro, one of many studies used to create the subsidence management plot (Oke et al. 2013).|","Document Type

In the main studies and theories that normally support the design of pillars in underground mines, two effects to be considered have been proposed in the more technically developed methods: the scale effect and the shape effect. Both of great importance and both, although apparently simple, are difficult to be interpreted as a whole and due to the complexity of their determinations, being their applications often neglected. In this paper, which is the product of a post-doctoral program in progress, one discusses the validity of their simultaneous application. Such doubt is due to the manner of their determination, because it can include or not the scale effect when determining the shape effect, depending on the employed method. Thus it is presented a discussion of the possible methodologies for their application and the involved principles and parameters. Finally one can conclude that, depending on the method considered in equating these effects, its application may make use of both simultaneously or just one of them, on the risk of oversizing the structure considered.
1. Introduction
The shape effect as proposed by Obert and Duvall (1967) and Bieniawski (1969, 1984a, 1984b) has the following form:
Cp = Co [a + BLL/H} (MPa) (1)
When the test is on intact rock, C0 is its strength. 
In the case of rock mass strength, the value of C0 should be replaced by the value CM, which corresponds to the rock mass compressive strength, obtained for the rock mass Representative Elemental Volume. 
It was discussed by the authors in a paper presented last year (Ayres Da Silva, L.A.;Ayres Da Silva, A.L.M.; Sansone, 2013), in which they propose that the dimension L of the expression above corresponds to more critical dimension, in structural terms, of the pillar section, instead of adopting simply the dimension of its smaller side, as occurs in determining the slenderness of pillars in the construction of concrete structures, in civil construction.
The resulting tests used to discuss the shape effect were presented in the paper cited above.|","Document Type

Mining activities have a great impact on the health and wealth of any nation. Though technology has reduced the adverse effects to a great extent, it is still experiencing unpredictable behaviour of rocks. The physical and mechanical properties of rocks are important for design of any excavation process. Time dependence must be considered essential for the study of deformation and fracturing processes of rock material, especially for those subjected to strong compressive and tensile stresses. In this study creep test is conducted in chromite ore under uniaxial compressive stresses. Rock Behaviour is investigated as well as strength of rock. Creep behaviour of rocks has been evaluated at varying stress and temperature rate. The relationship between compressive stress and time under uniaxial compression has also been developed. Finally nonlinear creep model is used to describe the creep behaviours of rocks under uniaxial compressive strength. This non linear creep model well depicts the dependence of creep properties of the ore and its influence by temperature and stress variation.
1. Introduction
Creep refers to the time-dependent deformation of soil or rock resulting from internal rearrangement of particles in response to the application of a sustained stress difference (<U+03C3>1 -<U+03C3> 3) generally smaller than the stress difference of the soil at failure=(<U+03C3> 1 -<U+03C3> 3), where <U+03C3> 1, <U+03C3> 3 are the major and minor compressive principal stresses, respectively. Deformation during undrained creep results from shape distortion as the soil mobilizes a constant shearing resistance in response to the shear stresses applied upon loading or unloading. Creep models have been applied toward the solution of a variety of engineering problems, such as the closure of and loads on tunnels, chambers, and pillars in creep-sensitive materials, such as salt, shale, and fault zones.
Undrained creep behaviour is closely related to the drained creep phenomenon associated with secondary consolidation and swelling in as much as the mechanisms that cause volume change. Studies (especially on potash mine pillars) have indicated that deformation of pillars do not occur instantaneously but increase with time. Pillars, which appear stable after mining may deteriorate with time and subsequently fail due to the development of limiting vertical deformation. Pillar failure takes place at a range of vertical stresses; failure at high stresses taking place earlier than at low stresses.|","Document Type
