Here, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of water block under different flow scenarios (i.e., without shut-ins) and rock permeabilities through multiple coreflood experiments. A computed-tomography (CT) scanner is used to obtain the saturation profile within the core throughout the experiment, while the overall hydrocarbon productivity is measured from the overall pressure drop across the core. |On the basis of the saturation and pressure measurements, we interpret the potential physical mechanism regarding the productivity reduction from water block and its self-mitigation facilitated by the capillary imbibition. Our interpretation also matches the observed scaling with rock permeability and the optimal shut-in time.|","Capillarity, Water Block, Shut In, Low-Permeability Rocks"

Although numerous pressure tests have proved the existence of well interference, relatively few physical models exist to quantitatively simulate the pressure response of well interference. The objective of the present study is to develop a numerical compositional model in combination with a fast embedded-discrete-fracture-model (EDFM) method to simulate well interference. Through nonneighboring connections (NNCs), the fast EDFM method can easily and properly handle complex-fracture geometries, such as nonplanar hydraulic fractures and a large amount of natural fractures. Using public data for Eagle Ford tight oil, we build a reservoir model including up to three horizontal wells and five fluid pseudocomponents. The simulation results show that the connecting hydraulic fractures play a more-important role than natural fractures in declining bottomhole pressure (BHP) of the shut-in well. Matrix permeability has a relatively minor effect on pressure drawdown, and well productivity remains only slightly affected by the overall low permeability used. The BHP pressure-decline profiles change from convex to concave when the conductivity of the connecting fractures increases. At early times, the BHP of the shut-in well decreases when the number of natural fractures increases. At later times, the natural-fracture density has a lesser effect on the pressure response and no clear trend. The opening order of neighboring wells affects the well-interference intensity between the target shut-in well and the surrounding wells. After a systematic investigation of pressure drawdown in the reservoir, we formulate practical conclusions for improved production performance.|","Hydraulic fracture hits, Shale oil, Complex fracture geometries, Well interference, Natural fractures"

Although the model is developed from production data and requires no prior knowledge of rock-property fields, it incorporates far more fundamental physics than that of the popular capacitance–resistance model (CRM). The new model also represents a substantial improvement on an interwell-numerical-simulation model (INSIM) that was presented previously in a paper coauthored by the latter two authors of the current paper. The new model, which is referred to as INSIM-FT, eliminates the three deficiencies of the original data-driven INSIM. The new model uses more interwell connections than INSIM to increase the fidelity of history matching and predictions and replaces the ad hoc computation procedure for computing saturation that is used in INSIM by a theoretically sound front-tracking procedure. Because of the introduction of a front-tracking method for the calculation of saturation, the new model is referred to as INSIM-FT. We compare the performance of CRM, INSIM, and INSIM-FT in two synthetic examples. INSIM-FT is also tested in a field example.|","data-driven, reservoir characterization, interwell connectivity, history matching, waterflooding"

Previous researchers have focused on the chemical and physical properties and microstructure of sandstone, carbonate, and shale caprock, rather than on the properties of shale-gas formations. The macroscale mechanical properties and microscale fracture characteristics of Wufeng Shale exposed to scCO2 (at greater than 31.8°C and 7.29 MPa) are still not well-understood. To study the macroscale and microscale changes of shale subjected to scCO2, we obtained Chinese Wufeng Shale crops (Upper Ordovician Formation) from Yibin, Sichuan Basin, China. The shale samples were divided into two groups. The first group was exposed to scCO2, and the second group was exposed to nitrogen (N2). Scanning-electron-microscope (SEM) and X-ray-diffraction (XRD) images were taken to study the original microstructure and mineral content of the shale. To study the macroscale mechanical changes of Wufeng Shale immersed in scCO2 or N2 for 10 hours, triaxial tests with controlled coring angles were conducted. SEM and XRD images were taken after the triaxial tests. In the SEM images, tight bedding planes and undamaged minerals (with sharp edges and smooth surfaces) were found in N2-treated samples both before and after testing, indicating that exposure to N2 did not affect the microstructures. However, the SEM images for the microstructure scCO2-treated samples before and after testing were quite different. The bedding planes were damaged, which left some connected microfractures and corrosion holes, and some mineral types were broken into small particles and left with uneven mineral surfaces. This shows that scCO2 can change rock microstructures and make some minerals (e.g., calcite) fracture more easily. The complex microscale fractures and the decrease in strength for scCO2-treated shale aid the seepage and gathering of gas, enhancing shale-gas recovery. Knowledge of the multiscale physical and chemical changes of shale exposed to scCO2 is not only essential for scCO2 fracturing, but it is also important for scCO2 jets used to break rock and for the geological storage of CO2.|","microstructure, Chinese Wufeng shale, supercritical carbon dioxide, triaxial compression experiment, multiscale characteristics"

Drilling, cementing, and completion engineers are addressing each technical and operational aspect of water injectors, including cement isolation. Cement serves as a barrier during well construction through to post-abandonment. It contributes to ensuring that no out-of-zone water injection occurs because of flow behind casing. If water does go out of zone, new drilling hazards that are a result of water breaching and a loss of reservoir management will occur. |At present, as far as we know, the industry does not have a systematic methodology for defining and verifying the required physical and mechanical properties of the cement to endure water-injection service and to retain its isolation capability during well life. Cement-integrity simulators (CISs) provide different answers, mainly because they all assume a different initial stress-state in the cement after hydration. As a consequence, a new CIS model that computes this stress state has been developed, along with a large-scale testing setup to validate its predictions. |The new model incorporates key-design parameters of effective CIS models: (1) The initial stress state after cement hydration is computed; (2) varying loadings that the cement sheath is submitted to are simulated; (3) the elasticity, plasticity, and failure of materials are taken into account; (4) the simulations are fast enough to facilitate sensitivity analysis; and (5) the model outputs allow the visualization of cement integrity across the entire length of the cement sheath, adjacent to reservoirs and to seals. |Parallel to the modeling work, a large-scale test apparatus was built to evaluate cement zonal isolation under water-injection pressure and temperature conditions. Its objective was to generate pressure and temperature cycles inside sections of cemented casing assemblies to replicate the conditions of pressure and temperature variations in a water-injection well. |The results of the test confirmed the accuracy of the new CIS model. They also showed that cooling because of water injection had a bigger impact on cement integrity than increasing pressure. In addition, the results showed that microannulus generation had more effect than tensile cracking in terms of cement-barrier-permeability increase.|","cementing, water injection, cement, zonal isolation"

The gas adsorption and stress effects are two crucial parameters that should be considered in shale rocks. Although stress-dependent porosity and permeability models have been introduced and applied to calculate effective porosity and permeability, the adsorption effect specified as pore volume (PV) occupied by adsorbate is not properly accounted. Generally, gas adsorption results in significant reduction of nanoscale porosity and permeability in shale-gas reservoirs because the PV is occupied by layers of adsorbed-gas molecules. |In this paper, correlations of effective porosity and permeability with the consideration of combining effects of gas adsorption and stress are developed for shale. For the adsorption effect, methane-adsorption capacity of shale rocks is measured on five shale-core samples in the laboratory by use of the gravimetric method. Methane-adsorption capacity is evaluated through performing regression analysis on Gibbs adsorption data from experimental measurements by use of the modified Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) equation (Sakurovs et al. 2007) under the supercritical condition, from which the density of adsorbate is found. In addition, the Gibbs adsorption data are converted to absolute adsorption data to determine the volume of adsorbate. Furthermore, the stress-dependent porosity and permeability are calculated by use of McKee correlations (McKee et al. 1988) with the experimentally measured constant pore compressibility by use of the nonadsorptive-gas-expansion method. |The developed correlations illustrating the changes in porosity and permeability with pore pressure in shale are similar to those produced by the Shi and Durucan model (2005), which represents the decline of porosity and permeability with the increase of pore pressure in the coalbed. The tendency of porosity and permeability change is the inverse of the common stress-dependent regulation that porosity and permeability increase with the increase of pore pressure. Here, the gas-adsorption effect has a larger influence on PV than stress effect does, which is because more gas is attempting to adsorb on the surface of the matrix as pore pressure increases. Furthermore, the developed correlations are added into a numerical-simulation model at field scale, which successfully matches production data from a horizontal well with multistage hydraulic fractures in the Barnett Shale reservoir. The simulation results note that without considering the effect of PV occupied by adsorbed gas, characterization of reservoir properties and prediction of gas production by history matching cannot be performed reliably. |The purpose of this study is to introduce a model to calculate the volume of the adsorbed phase through the adsorption isotherm and propose correlations of effective porosity and permeability in shale rocks, including the consideration of the effects of both gas adsorption and stress. In addition, practical application of the developed correlations to reservoir-simulation work might achieve an appropriate evaluation of effective porosity and permeability and provide an accurate estimation of gas production in shale-gas reservoirs.|","nanoscale, Effective porosity and permeability, adsorption"

This spatial and temporal behavior of these shallow microseismic events incurs some questions regarding the nature of these events and their connectivity to the hydraulic fracture. To answer these questions, in this article, we investigate these phenomena by use of a true 3D fracture-propagation-modeling tool along with statistical analysis on the properties of microseismic events. |First, we propose a novel technique in Abaqus incorporating fracture intersections in true 3D hydraulic-fracture-propagation simulations by use of a pore-pressure cohesive zone model (CZM), which is validated by comparing our numerical results with the Khristianovic-Geertsma-de Klerk (KGD) solution (Khristianovic and Zheltov 1955; Geertsma and de Klerk 1969). The simulations fully couple slot flow in the fracture with poroelasticity in the matrix and continuum-based leakoff on the fracture walls, and honor the fracture-tip effects in quasibrittle shales. By use of this model, we quantify vertical-natural-fracture activation and fluid infiltration depending on reservoir depth, fracturing-fluid viscosity, mechanical properties of the natural-fracture cohesive layer, natural-fracture conductivity, and horizontal stress contrast. The modeling results demonstrate this natural-fracture activation in coincidence with the hydraulic-fracture-growth complexities at the intersection, such as height throttling, sharp aperture reduction after the intersection, and multibranching at various heights and directions. |Finally, we investigate the hydraulic-fracture intersection with a natural fracture in the multilayer VM Shale. We infer the natural-fracture location and orientation from the microseismic-events map and formation microimager log in a nearby vertical well, respectively. We integrate the other field information such as mechanical, geological, and operational data to provide a realistic hydraulic-fracturing simulation in the presence of a natural fracture. Our 3D fracturing simulations equipped with the new fracture-intersection model rigorously simulate the growth of a realistic hydraulic-connection path toward the natural fracture at shallower depths, which was in agreement with our microseismic observations.|","hydraulic-natural fracture interaction and intersection, microseismic, pore pressure cohesive zone model, the Vaca Muerta Shale, 3D fully-coupled poroelastic-fracturing analysis"

Instead of generating simulation cases exhaustively to solve history-matching (HM) problems, proxy models that are created by RSM provide useful benefits in terms of simplicity and computational efficiency. However, the capability of proxy models to fully capture uncertainty ranges of HM results and production forecasts might be deficient in complex problems if the simplified proxy models only deliver partial solutions. Hence, to decide whether the uncertainty-assessment process by proxy models is complete, the models should deliver as many HM solutions as required to build probability distribution of production forecasts. Therefore, we developed the work flow to combine both processes into an integrated proxy-based approach that searches for the accepted HM solution while probabilistic forecasts are evaluated simultaneously. In addition, the combined work flow is an iterative approach. It gradually modifies the proxy models dependent on the increasing number of completed simulation runs, which continually update the original proxy model into higher degree of polynomial. The use of higher-degree-polynomial equations appears to have the benefit to provide an expanded set of HM solutions inside the uncertain parameter space compared with the commonly used quadratic form. More solutions found from the iterations could eventually approximate wider uncertainty ranges of probabilistic forecasts, which is consistent with the direct Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method but with a significant reduction of simulated cases. Finally, this paper applies the proxy-based approach to a reservoir-simulation model containing a horizontal hydraulic-fractured well in the Marcellus Shale formation. This proxy-based approach helps assess the uncertainty of reservoir and fracture properties of unconventional reservoirs. Also, it is useful for evaluating the ranges of ultimate gas recovery.|","Markov Chain Monte Carlo, History Matching, Response Surface Methodology, Shale Gas, Probabilistic Forecasting"

Core cleaning is one aspect of this problem. |The objective of this study is to shed some light on the shale core-cleaning conundrum. The study shows the cleaning impact of different solvents on samples from different maturity windows and having different in-situ fluids. It also compares the cleaning efficiency between plug and powdered samples. Different cleaning apparatus, such as the high-pressure extractor (HPE) and the Soxhlet extractor, are also compared. |Different measurements, such as source-rock analysis (S1 and S2 values); gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) extraction analysis; Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore-size distribution help to understand the dynamics of core cleaning. This study was carried out on samples from the Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford formations. |Cleaning has a major impact on various petrophysical properties like porosity (increases up to 50%), S1 (decreases up to 90%) and surface area (increases by 450%). This study showed that cleaning time is a function of maturity and sample state. Samples in the oil-maturity window are much more difficult to clean compared to the samples in the gas-maturity window. Similarly, plug samples are more difficult to clean compared to the crushed samples. Our study shows that toluene, dichloromethane (DCM) and chloroform have similar cleaning efficiencies but n-heptane is less efficient. |Introduction |Coring is an integral part of any exploration program. The planning for a coring program, coring fluids and corehandling procedures at the wellsite are all very important for preserving the core and getting accurate measurements in the laboratory.|","Document Type

Rainbolt presented a 43-page paper by Apache (SPE 187192) at the 2017 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition in October, which offered a broad look at the problem with examples and ideas on how to manage it. |The impact of a hit can be big and immediate. The Apache paper included a look at a well whose production dropped 65% after a hit and remained down until it was treated. |But these fracturing-driven interactions may only be apparent with production analysis. Apache’s study found one pair of wells where the area fractured by the second well overlapped with the original well. As a result, it said “the existing well could have produced the reserves without the infill well.” |Tightly spaced wells fractured using more water and sand are producing more oil, “but if you look at the incremental production per frac, you see it is going down,” said George King, the lead author on the paper and the global technology distinguished engineering advisor for Apache. |King is leading an effort with Ali Daneshy, president of Daneshy Consultants International, to produce an SPE technical paper commissioned by the SPE Board of Directors on fracturing-driven interactions due in the spring.|","Document Type

To decrease the number of fracturing stages per well, it is common practice to use multiple clusters per stage. This is done with the hope that most of the clusters in the stage will be effectively stimulated. Diagnostic evidence, however, suggests that in many cases, only one or two out of four or five clusters in a stage are effectively stimulated. |In this paper, strategies to maximize the number of effectively stimulated perforation clusters are discussed. A fully 3D poroelastic model that simulates the propagation of nonplanar fractures in heterogeneous media is developed and used to model the propagation of multiple competing fractures. A parametric study is first conducted to demonstrate how important fracture-design variables, such as limited-entry perforations and cluster spacing, and formation parameters, such as permeability and lateral and vertical heterogeneity, affect the growth of competing fractures. The effect of stress shadowing caused by both mechanical and poroelastic effects is accounted for. |3D numerical simulations have been performed to show the effect of some operational and reservoir parameters on simultaneous-competitive-fracture propagation. It was found that an increase in stage spacing decreases the stress interference between propagating fractures and increases the number of propagating fractures in a stage. It was also found that an increase in reservoir permeability can decrease the stress interference between propagating fractures because of poroelastic-stress changes. A modest (approximately 25%) variability in reservoir mechanical properties along the wellbore is shown to be enough to alter the number of fractures created in a hydraulic-fracturing stage and mask the effects of stress shadowing. Interstage fracture simulations show post-shut-in fracture extension induced by stress interference from adjacent propagating fractures. The effect of poroelasticity is highlighted for infill-well-fracture design, and preferential fracture propagation toward depleted regions is clearly observed in multiwell-pad-fracture simulations. |The results in this paper attempt to provide practitioners with a better understanding of multicluster-fracturing dynamics. On the basis of these findings, recommendations are made on how best to design fracture treatments that will lead to the successful placement of fluid and proppant in a single fracture, and result in a set of fractures that are competing for growth. The ability to successfully stimulate all perforation clusters is shown to be a function of key fracture-design parameters.|","stress shadow, flow distribution, competitive fracture growth, poroelasticity, fracturing"

We propose a convenient section-based optimization of the fracture array with two integer variables, the number of columns (horizontal laterals) and rows (fractures created in a lateral), to provide some general statements regarding spacing of wells and fractures. The approach is dependent on a reliable and efficient productivity-index (PI) calculation for the boundary-dominated state (BDS). The dimensionless PI is obtained by solving a time-independent eigenvalue problem by use of the finite-element method (FEM) combined with the Richardson extrapolation. |The results of the case study demonstrate two decisive factors: the dimensionless total fracture length, related to the total amount of proppant and fracturing fluid available for the section, and the feasible range of actual fracture half-lengths, related to current fracturing-technology limitations. Under the constraint of dimensionless total fracture length, increasing the number of columns (horizontal laterals) increases the total PI but with only diminishing returns, whereas the optimal fracture-penetration ratio decreases somewhat, but is still near unity. When adding the technological constraint of a limited range of fracture half-lengths that can be routinely and reliably created, only a few choices remain admissible, and the optimal decision can be easily made. These general statements for the ideal homogeneous and isotropic formation can serve as a reference in the more-detailed optimization works. In other words, we offer a first-pass method for decision making in early stages when detailed inputs are not yet available. The information derived from the section-based optimization method and the efficient and reliable algorithm for PI calculation should help the design of multistage fracturing in shale-gas or ultralow-permeability oil formations.|","section-based method, boundary dominated state, productivity index, optimal development plan"

We have conducted a series of hydro-mechanical shear experiments using the CSIRO direct shear rig. There blocks were fabricated using loose calcite and quartz grains cemented by a calcium-rich fluid that permeated and filled the interconnected pore spaces to bind the grains together, i.e. this technology is known as CIPS (Calcite In-situ Precipitation System). Those intact homogenous CIPS blocks (240 <U+00D7> 120 <U+00D7> 150 mm) were sheared to final displacements of 20, 70 or 120 mm under a constant effective vertical stress of 10 MPa.
Fluid-flow response across the fault zone was monitored during both shear deformation and hold periods, while keeping a constant injection pressure throughout the measurement. On reaching the final displacement (20, 70 or 120 mm), we cored a cylindrical plug of 38 mm diameter that contains fault zone and parts of intact wall rock at either end. In parallel to the experimental study, a 2D mechanical model of the shear experiments was developed using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), suitable for deformation processes involving very large strains. Numerical results were compared with the experimental data for a better understanding of local deformation process, stress distribution and potential tension cracks in samples during shear.
Shear results show all the tested blocks indicated strain-softening behaviour and the flow rate decreased as displacement increased. Plastic deformation is compactant and resulted in the development of localised zone of deformation that decrease the fluid transmissibility of the blocks. Furthermore, x-ray CT images show that the created deformation features in the sheared blocks resembled those observed in natural fault zones.
1. Introduction
The growth of natural faults is controlled by several factors including: tectonics stress, strain rate, pore pressure and host rocks. The impact of faults and their potential reactivation on oil and gas reservoirs have been investigated [1, 2]. Compactive and dilatant deformation in porous rocks is a crucial problem in fault development, geotechnical engineering and reservoir/aquifer management. Active tectonics and extraction of fluids from buried porous host rocks modify the pore pressure in a reservoir/aquifer, causing variations of the effective stress possibly leading to faulting and inelastic deformation that can in turn adversely affect oil production as in the case of the deep water reservoir in the Campos Basin [3]. In contrast with sandstone lithologies, limestones and marbles undergo brittle to plastic transition at room temperature for confining pressures accessible in laboratory [4, 5], because calcite requires relatively low shear stresses to initiate mechanical twinning and dislocation activity. The mechanical behaviour of carbonate rocks of a wide range of porosities has been documented by many previous studies [6-8].|","Direct Shear Test,  Transmissibility,  Direct Shear Test, CIPS block,  Transmissibility,  SPH,  SPH,  SPH,  Direct Shear Test,  Transmissibility, CIPS block, CIPS block"

Various literatures have suggested the presence of in-situ fractured rock mass even in massive granite formations. Thereby, 3D numerical modelling is essential, since the prediction of fracture growth in 3D is key to investigation of different fracture designs and furthermore various operational parameters in order to optimize the heat exchanger design and the resulting energy production. The numerical approach incorporates the Dynardo’s approach of homogenized continuum method to simulate the hydro-shearing process in jointed rocks unlike vast majority of commercial and scientific approaches which use the discrete modelling technique. The main motivation of the continuum approach is the numerical efficiency of the 3D coupled hydraulic- mechanical simulations of hydraulic fracturing process in comparison to other alternatives. The input parameters of the numerical model from the best available well log and reservoir data are calibrated from diagnostics measurements such as Micro-seismic events, Bottom Hole Pressure, etc to assign the correct level of forecast quality to the important mechanisms of hydraulic fracturing. The numerical procedure is applied to a prospective Granite reservoir in Thuringen, Germany within the purview of a German joint research project - optiRiss. The integrated approach involves ANSYS as a pre-processor and solver, Dynardo’s fracturing simulator on top of ANSYS, Tamino - a post-processing tool and optiSLang - an environment for optimization and uncertainty quantification.
Energy consumption in the world has seen an ever increasing upward trend since the early part of the 20th century. Still a major chunk of the total energy supply comes from non-renewable energy resources with approximately 66 % supplied only by crude oil, natural gas and coal reserves. The large share of these resources are not just restricted to developing economies such as China, Brazil, etc. but also economic powerhouses such as USA and the European Union [1]. Geothermal Energy provides tremendous benefits in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse emissions and generating new economic and employment opportunities. Geothermal Power systems aim to extract the inexhaustible heat available beneath the earth's surface. Natural Geothermal springs are rare to find and hard to locate and in order to reduce dependence on naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs, Hot Dry Rock/Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) provide a suitable alternative. EGS reservoirs are set-up by drilling wells beneath the earth's surface and creating a man-made permeable fracture network between the wells. In the process, Hydraulic Fracturing is a well-stimulation technique used for creating artificial heat exchanger by creating a network of permeable fractures between injection and production wells.|","multiPlas,  optiSlang, Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Reservoir,  Calibration,  ANSYS, Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Reservoir,  Jointed Rocks,  Enhanced Geothermal Systems,  Calibration,  Jointed Rocks,  ANSYS,  optiSlang,  multiPlas,  Calibration,  Jointed Rocks, Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Reservoir,  Enhanced Geothermal Systems,  optiSlang,  ANSYS,  multiPlas,  Enhanced Geothermal Systems"

Roof and rib falls are still a leading cause of injuries in underground coal mines. When numerical simulation method is adopted to study this phenomenon, the influence of regular laminations on strength and size effect should be carefully considered because rock mass of roof is usually laminated. In order to get an insight into the influence of different lamination factors on size effect, cubic rock specimens with different sizes, stress directions, lamination orientations and lamination spacing were tested under true tri-axial conditions with 3DEC. The results show that regular lamination can cause size effect even without considering size effect of the intact rock and rock joints. The influence of lamination orientation on size effect is distinct and is orientation-dependent while the influence of lamination thickness is minimal. Changing dip or stress direction will affect the influence of orientation and size effect as well.
1. Introduction
Improvements in roof control technology have led to significant decrease in accidents related to roof and rib falls. This brought the number of injury from roof and rib falls from 377 in 2012 down to 265 in 2013 [1]. But roof fall is still a leading cause of injuries in underground coal mines. And numerical simulation method has been widely used to investigate the mechanism and prevention of such problems [2-4]. Proper rock mechanics property, however, is crucial to obtain practical results in numerical simulation. Size effect is an important factor when laboratory-determined strength value is used to determine rock mass strength value for simulation.
Due to the importance of size effect, studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between rock strength and their size. Bieniawski [5] conducted extensive underground tests on cubical coal specimens ranging from 0.75 inches to 6.6 ft in size. Singh and Huck [6] performed tri-axial compression tests on specimens with diameters ranging from 2 to 36 inches and approximate 50 percent strength reduction was observed. Medhurst and Brown [7] performed tri-axial compression tests on coal specimens with diameters of 61, 101, 146 and 300 mm to investigate size effect on mechanical behaviour of coal. Besides, numerical simulation was widely used to investigate size effect. Adey and Pusch [8] simulated size effect with boundary element method by considering larger discontinuities with increasing specimen volume. The discrete element program Ca2 was used [9] to simulate size effect and the result shows that initial crack length must be increased faster than specimen size to capture size effect. Scholtes et al. [10] studied size effect of coal by simulating true tri-axial compression tests with a discrete element model, which shows the capability to reproduce the dependency of strength on specimen size. Zhang et al. [11] investigated size effect with bonded particle model, where the initial fractures were considered as randomly orientated and located disks.|","stress direction,  orientation,  laminated rock,  spacing,  stress direction,  laminated rock,  orientation,  spacing,  stress direction,  orientation, Size effect, Size effect, Size effect,  laminated rock,  spacing"

This paper applies a modified ubiquitous joint plane model (Modified Ubi) to describe the mechanical behavior of layered rock masses. The constitutive model is an implicit-continuum based one where the joints are smeared across the rock mass. This modified model concerns not only the strength anisotropy but also it integrates the elastic stiffness anisotropy. Thus, the elastic stress increments and the plastic corrections from the original ubiquitous joint model have been altered. Now, it is possible to simulate the elastic and plastic behavior of transversely isotropic rocks. Modified Ubi is applied to simulate the behavior of the transverse isotropic rock samples in uniaxial compressive loading and triaxial loading tests. The results out of the modified model were compared to the analytical solution from Jaeger and the CANISO model from FLAC 8.0.
1. Introduction
Determining the rock mass properties and expecting its behavior are matter of the modelling of the discontinuities in the rock continua. Because of the complex mechanism of the rock mass which may not be directly predicted using the conventional ways of modeling (such as: closed form solutions or physical modelling); numerical modelling is one of the most trending means to model behavior of rock mass [1]. The condition of the rock mass (such as: excessively fractured or reasonably fractured or intact massive) and the scale of the engineering application (i.e.: layering is significantly smaller or bigger than the scale of the application) affect strongly the optimum approach selection of the applied numerical model, either continuum-based approach or discontinuum-based one [2]. Modelling of layered rock mass is still a point of interest between different computational tools which either consider the joint implicitly (i.e.: FLAC - Ubiquitous joint model) or use the explicit representation of the discontinuities (i.e.: UDEC - Discreet element model) [3]. However, both the computational power and time consumed in calculation limit the usage of such discrete approaches. The accuracy of different implicit joint models has been investigated between both the ubiquitous joint model and Cosserat model [4]. This paper adopts the continuum-based approach to implicitly model an isotropic rock mass (i.e.: smeared joints).|","FLAC,  Transverse Isotropy,  FLAC,  Transverse Isotropy,  Ubiquitous Joint Plane,  FLAC, Stiffness Anisotropy,  Transverse Isotropy,  Ubiquitous Joint Plane,  Ubiquitous Joint Plane, Stiffness Anisotropy, Stiffness Anisotropy"

The exploitation of geo-energies often leads to difficulties that rock mechanics helps to overcome. These essentially consist of instability problems caused by changes in the state of stress, associated pore pressures, and temperature. Besides the classical near field problem of wellbore stability, the changes can impact a larger scale, triggering earthquakes and inducing seismicity. In this paper the current approaches envisaged to tackle these problems are briefly reviewed and discussed. Some extensions that have been made possible thanks to the combination of new numerical techniques will be outlined.
1. Introduction
The term geo-energy could be defined as the set of energy sources that the Earth produces. As in physical science where all is Energy or Matter, this would include fossil fuels such as coal, oil, gas or organic matter (wood) which is nowadays classified as unconventional geo-resources.
In fact, the neologism “geo-energy” is mostly devoted to the energy that has been created from the temperature of the Earth and which is used to heat or to produce electricity. This is the case for geothermal energy [1]; the exploitation of geothermal energy was considered a long time ago [2], but it has only taken off in the last twenty years. The main reason is the urgent need to limit emissions of greenhouse gases and the lure of a renewable resource [3].
Despite the fact that many other issues could be related to Geo-energies, such as energy storage by compressed air for instance, this paper will be limited to rock mechanics problems associated with Enhanced Geothermal Systems.
2. Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS)
2.1. Principle and brief history
The principle of a geothermal installation can be schematically represented by two boreholes. From the first borehole the injected cold water circulates into the rock mass and is heated up in contact with the hot rock. This hot water is then extracted in the second borehole and treated to remove energy. Later, this cooled water is re-injected in the first borehole. The effectiveness and the efficiency of the system depends on the existence or the formation of a sufficient exchange surface in the hot dry rock formation, between the two boreholes.|","Enhanced Geothermal System,  hydraulic fracturing,  hydraulic fracturing, Enhanced Geothermal System,  numerical modelling,  hydraulic fracturing, Enhanced Geothermal System,  numerical modelling,  numerical modelling"

A fast computational code is presented that is dedicated for the elastic analysis of three-dimensional excavations and cracks in rocks. The problem is solved on the boundaries that are discretized with a new triangular leaf constant displacement discontinuity element with one collocation point. The creation of the new triangular element was inspired from Mindlin’s special version of grade-2 or strain-gradient elasticity theory (second gradient of displacement, g2). This element is characterized by a much better measure of the average stress at the center of gravity of the triangular element compared to that of the classical elasticity element close to regions with stress or strain gradients (e.g. notches, cracks etc). In a verification stage, the accuracy of the computational algorithm for the pressurized penny-shaped and mixed-mode elliptical crack problems that have analytical solutions is demonstrated. More specifically, it is shown that the average error of the crack tip Stress Intensity Factor predicted by the gradient modified method for nine discretizations of varying density is around 3.5 % with a maximum error of 5 %, while the constant displacement discontinuity element displays errors varying around 14 %. Moreover, the new method preserves the simplicity and hence the high speed of the constant displacement discontinuity with only one collocation point per element, but it is far more efficient compared to it, especially close to the crack tips and corners of excavations where the displacement and stress gradients are highest.
1. Introduction
It is almost certain that any planned underground excavation in the scale of 101 m or more will transect a fault or persistent joint. The problem in the design phase is to examine the effect of the faults on the behavior of the rock mass during excavation and then to optimize the design of the underground openings and pillars. In Geophysics there remains the reasonable trend to explain earthquake mechanisms by means of dislocation or fracture mechanics models. Also, in petroleum engineering as well as in Rock Mechanics, the hydraulic fracturing technique where a pressurized mode-I crack propagates from a shallow or deep borehole, is widely used for permeability enhancement and measurement of in situ stresses, respectively. There many more problems involving threedimensional excavations and fractures that should be attacked with computational methods capable to tackle in a formal and accurate manner crack tip or corner singularities.|","displacement discontinuity method,  crack,  dislocation,  stress intensity factor, displacement discontinuity method,  rock excavation, displacement discontinuity method,  crack,  dislocation,  stress intensity factor,  rock excavation,  stress intensity factor,  rock excavation,  dislocation,  crack"

A new series of double shear tests were carried out using a newly modified double shear apparatus which prevented contacts between concrete block surfaces during shearing. 13 double shear tests were carried out using 21 mm diameter 19 (9 <U+00D7> 9 <U+00D7> 1) seal construction wire strand cable (also called Superstrand cable), Plain SUMO, Indented SUMO, Spiral MW9 and Plain MW10 cable bolts. These cables were tested subjected to different pretension loads. Concrete blocks with Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of 40 MPa and Stratabinder grout were used for all the tests to maintain test consistency. The results show that the peak shear load and the corresponding shear displacement decrease by increasing the pretension load of the tested cable. The Ultimate tensile strength, lay length, number of wires and cable bolt surface profile type (plain and spiral/indented) are important factors in total shear strength of the cable bolt.
1. Introduction
Mining in Australia is one of the safest industries but there are still some fatal accidents. The number of deaths was 10, 13 and 13 in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively [1]. The current emphasis is to towards zero fatality Therefore, one of the greatest concerns to designers and engineers during and after excavation is the stability of underground excavations and surface mining slopes. It is important for designers to understand and have views on various forms of instability and the mechanisms of failures and associated conditions to support the unstable surfaces by installing various types of cable bolts for effective ground stabilization.
The application of cable bolts as a secondary support system is a growing trend in underground coal mines worldwide [2].The first type of cable bolts used in mines consisted of seven high tensile strength and pre-stressed wires, which were arranged in the strand with plastic spacers. The plain strand cable bolts with poor load transfer properties due to smooth and straight profile wires were initially introduced to mines, as a temporary means of rock reinforcement. Over the years, a number of modifications has been introduced to the plain strand cable, such as strand surface profiling and indentations [3], double plain strand [4], epoxy-coated strand [5], fiberglass cable bolt [6], birdcage strand [7], bulbed strand [8], and nutcage strand cable bolts [9]. These various types of cable bolt have been incorporated to improve the load transfer capacity as permanent ground reinforcement.|","Cable bolt,  pretension,  cable debonding,  double shear test,  cable debonding, Cable bolt,  double shear test,  pretension, Cable bolt,  cable debonding,  double shear test,  pretension"

The Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of intact rocks is an essential index of strength in rock engineering. Laboratory based direct compressive strength estimation may be problematic, as obtaining fresh samples is not always feasible. Thus, the aim of indirect methods index test such as point load index test, and empirical correlations with UCS of indexes like the Brazilian indirect tensile strength test, serve as an alternative for many geotechnical engineering projects. The aim of this paper is to propose a relationship between UCS and indirect tests or indexes for some sedimentary and igneous rocks in KwaZulu-Natal using the technology of artificial intelligence. These tests include the point load index (Is (50)) test and Brazilian Tensile Strength (<U+03C3>t, test. Block samples were collected in KwaZulu Natal, among these include sedimentary rocks (sandstones, siltstone, tillite) and igneous rocks (granitoids and dolerite). A back propagation artificial neural network was developed and trained in order to predict UCS. The input parameters were unit weight <U+03B3>, (Is (50)), (<U+03C3>t), and lithology. The lithology was introduced in the neural network as a qualitative input parameter, in order to indirectly incorporate in the model the mineralogical content. Training results returned, R value of 0.99% for the training set, and R = 0.92% for the test set, which is conveying to the conclusion that the approach is valid and could be used, as an alternative indirect approach to UCS estimation.
1. Introduction
Geotechnical design requires the estimation of intact rock properties. Strength of intact rock is a key parameter required in rock mass classification systems (RMR) [1], Q-system [2], and Hoek - Brown criterion [3]. Typically, the strength and the modulus of elasticity of intact rock can be determined by the unconfined compression test. This test is standardized by the International society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM 2007) [4]. Direct determination of these properties in the laboratory are complicated and often time consuming [5, 6]. Hence, the indirect estimation of UCS using rock index tests is of interest. The aim of this paper is the assessment of a relationship between UCS and indirect tests or indexes used to estimate the value of UCS based on data from sedimentary and igneous rocks in KwaZulu-Natal. These tests include the point load index (Is (50)) test and the Brazilian Tensile Strength test. An artificial neural network was developed to predict a reliable UCS value. A back propagation ANN was developed and trained in order to predict UCS value based on blocks sample data from the (29) sedimentary and (14) igneous rocks. Among these 43 rock blocks samples were cored for the UCS, test, 129 for the point load test and 258 for the Brazilian test. The input parameters were unit weight <U+03B3>, (Is (50)), (<U+03C3>t), and lithology. The lithologies that are abundant in the KwaZulu-Natal province and were available for this study, are granitoid rocks, dolerite, sandstone, and tillite.|","Artifical Neural Networks,  Brazilian Tensile Strength, Uniaxial Compressive Strength,  Brazilian Tensile Strength,  Brazilian Tensile Strength,  Artifical Neural Networks,  Point Load Index,  Point Load Index, Uniaxial Compressive Strength, Uniaxial Compressive Strength,  Artifical Neural Networks,  Point Load Index"

In this article, the concept of Fatigue Hydraulic Fracturing (FHF) is described, and its geothermal application is discussed. The basic idea behind fatigue fracturing is to vary the effective stress magnitudes at the fracture tip to optimize fracture initiation and growth. The optimization process can include lowering seismic radiated energy and/or generating fracture networks with various geometry and permeability. Historically, we start referring to results from mechanical laboratory core testing, discrete element simulation of fluid-induced seismicity, and application of cyclic water-fracs at the enhanced geothermal system site Gn<U+03B2>-Schonebeck, Germany. Then, an in situ experiment at Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory is summarized to bridge the gap between laboratory core testing and wellbore-size hydraulic fracture treatments in hard rock. Three different fluid injection schemes (continuous, progressive and pulse injection) are tested underground in naturally fractured, crystalline rock mass in terms of associated induced seismicity and permeability performance. Under controlled conditions, hydraulic fractures are extended to about 20-40 m2 in size from a 28 m long, horizontal borehole drilled from a tunnel at 410 m depth. The facture process is mapped by an extensive array of acoustic emission and micro-seismic monitoring instruments. Results from three water-injection tests in Avro granodiorite indicate that the fracture breakdown pressure in tendency becomes lower and the number of fluid-induced seismic events becomes less when continuous, conventional fluid injection is replaced by progressive fluid-injection with several phases of depressurization simulating the fatigue treatment. One reason for this may be that in the dynamic, fatigue treatment a larger fracture process zone is generated compared to the size of the fluid pressurized zone developing during the injection phases into crystalline rock. We see mine-scale tests with hybrid sensor arrays of importance to identify and understand the actual hydraulic fracture mechanisms in hard rock. In addition, the mesoscale data obtained underground allow downscaling to laboratory core results, and upscaling to borehole reservoir stimulation results.
1. Introduction
Hydraulic fracture growth through naturally fractured rock is an area of interest and current research for petroleum, mining and geothermal applications. In particular in the development of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), hydraulic fracturing is used to form fracture networks connecting injection and production well for heat exchange purposes. However, hydraulic fracturing imposes environmental risks, one of which is induced seismicity associated with the permeability enhancement process [1-3]. Of particular interest are, therefore, methods that limit the number and magnitude of seismic events while the required fracture permeability is obtained. In this context, the fatigue hydraulic fracturing (FHF) concept and the multi-stage hydraulic stimulation concept have been proposed. The key point in fatigue hydraulic fracturing is the frequent lowering of the injection pressure to allow stress relaxation at the fracture tip [4]. Reducing the maximum injection pressure by alternative injection schemes will affect the damage zone surrounding the fracture and also the radiation pattern of seismic events associated with fracture growth [5]. For multi-stage stimulation, instead of massive stimulation, injection rate and pressure are controlled, and the reservoir is formed stage by stage [6, 7].|","Fatigue process,  hydraulic fracturing,  hydraulic fracturing,  stress measurements,  stress measurements,  hard rock,  hydraulic fracturing,  stress measurements,  hard rock, Fatigue process,  hard rock, Fatigue process"

Fracture propagation in brittle rock is very fast and highly dynamic. Typically this process consists of fracture initiation, propagation and termination. Growth of micro-fractures is conceptually and numerically well established, however, current practices to model fracture propagation in rock employs slow evolving static regimes that do not represent the true nature of fracture propagation in the laboratory or the field. This paper presents a newly developed numerical approach using Micro-Brittle Dynamics theory to model the propagation of fractures through rock in real time. This work presented here is based on a newly developed Dynamic Rock Fracture Model (DRFM2D) and validated against laboratory experiments.
1. Introduction
Current advances in computing technology have enabled solutions of many complex geotechnical problems. However when a presence of large fractures dominate strata behaviour, these solutions may not be correct. Available numerical software can be generally divided into three groups: Elastic, Inelastic Time-Dependent Implicit and Inelastic Time-Dependent Explicit. These are briefly discussed in Table 1.
Whilst available Inelastic Time-Dependent Explicit Methods are currently used to simulate ground failure, they are in most cases not employed correctly. Most researchers will use the Quasi-Static formulation and slow evolving material damage to resolve highly dynamic fracture phenomena, consequently they are not capable of capturing true real time dynamic brittle effects occurring within the rock mass.
New development of a 2-dimensional dynamic rock fracture model (DRFM2D) in FLAC2D [1] challenges the use of numerical methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiencies towards accurately modelling the dynamic brittle fracture propagation through rock in real time. Our currently developed DRFM2D model is focused on the practical application of fracture dynamics in engineering. An overview of the natural physical processes and the governing constitutive laws is outlined here.
2. Micro-Brittle Dynamics (MBD)
2.1. Micro-Scale Dynamic Response
The dynamic action of the smallest finite mass in a continuum model represents the discrete dynamic response of a single element. In general, mechanical stress-strain response of any brittle or ductile rock past the elastic limit can follow one of four behaviours; Strain Hardening, Elastic-Plastic, Strain Softening or Perfectly Brittle. These rock failure types are illustrated in Fig. 1a. In Micro-Brittle Dynamics (MBD), where brittle materials are unable to absorb plastic deformation energy prior to fracture, the dynamic micro-scale interactions exhibit an ideal brittle failure response. This occurs at the elastic strength limit taking the brittle failure path curve in time as illustrated in Fig. 1b.|","Dynamic fracture propagation,  Numerical modelling, Dynamic fracture propagation,  Numerical modelling, Dynamic fracture propagation,  Numerical modelling"

The indirect (Brazilian) tensile strength test is commonly used in rock engineering and rock mechanics. Most of the research on how to interpret Brazilian test is only valid for isotropic rock. The load may be applied to disc shaped samples through flat platens or curved jaws and the different load configurations give rise to subtle but important differences to stress distributions throughout samples during testing and at the onset of failure. To reliably obtain the tensile strength accurate stress distributions, especially at the location of the initial crack, must be determined. However, most real rocks exhibit a certain type of anisotropy known as transverse isotropy due to the presence of preferred directions of grains, beddings, microcracks or pores. This study focuses on the failure modes when transverse isotropy is present. Previous studies for transverse isotropy indicate that the exact location of the initial crack is at the disc centre. These studies, however, ignore the effect of the load contact configuration on the stress distribution. This paper overcomes this limitation and applies Amadei’s analytical solution to assess the effects of the load contact area on the stress distribution. The stress distribution is coupled with a transverse isotropy failure criterion in a mechanically consistent way to find the exact location of initial crack. It is shown that the location of the initial crack depends on the transverse isotropy orientation and load configuration.
1. Introduction
The Brazilian test is a diametrical compression test that is used as an indirect tensile strength measurement. At first, the test was proposed by Carneiro [1] and Akazawa [2] to obtain tensile strength of concrete. In 1978, the International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) officially presented Brazilian test as a standard method to indirectly determine the tensile strength of rock like materials (ISRM 2007).
Nowadays the Brazilian test is widely used to determine tensile strength of rock like materials because of its simple specimen preparation, experimental performance and data reduction [3-4]. In the test, a thin disc is diametrically compressed. The corresponding stress field throughout the specimen is highly non-uniform.|","Analytical solution,  Analytical solution,  Crack initiation,  Anisotropic rocks,  Analytical solution,  Crack initiation, Brazilian disc,  Anisotropic rocks, Brazilian disc,  Anisotropic rocks,  Crack initiation, Brazilian disc"

R., University of Vigo| Alonso, E., University of Vigo| Arzua, J., Universidad Catolica del Norte| Araujo, M., University of Vigo","|Abstract
The complete stress-strain response of a number of intact rocks —including igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary ones— has been studied based on more than 300 compressive uniaxial and triaxial strength tests. Obtained results have been typically interpreted to register peak and residual strength as well as other post-peak parameters. Particular attention was given to the study of dilatancy. Dilation angle of these intact rocks was fitted to two pioneering but still recent dilatancy models (Alejano & Alonso 2005; Zhao & Cai 2010), having the feature of being plastic-shear-strain and confinement-stress dependent. The aim of this paper is to identify various dilation trends according to the type of rock tested and to check the ability of the models to accommodate actual results. This can be the base to further extend these models to the rock mass scale. To do that, the dilation angle database produced in our laboratory and some results from other tests taken from literature have been compiled in order to explain the main behavioral trends of this parameter according to the addressed models. These approaches are intended to insight rock behavior models emphasizing the post-failure stage as well as to contribute to more realistic but still practical dilatancy models.
1. Introduction
For several years, the stability assessment of rock engineering projects was mainly based on avoiding failure, hence the elastic and peak mechanical behavior of rocks have been extensively studied since they may represent, a priori, the most determining features to control stability.
Nevertheless, the post-peak behavior of rocks and rock masses plays a relevant role in important fields of rock engineering where failure take place. For instance mining caving methods, petroleum engineering or the estimate of plastic zones around underground excavation largely depend on post failure behavior. It is therefore interesting to have available improved post-failure behavior models to be able to study these phenomena both analytically and numerically, as highlighted by various authors [1, 2].|","post-peak, strain-softening, strain-softening, strain, strain, strain,  dilation angle, post-peak, strain-softening,  dilation angle,  dilation angle, post-peak"

In-situ stress state in deep reservoirs is highly variable due to many factors and it markedly influence the propagation behavior of hydraulic fractures. The direction and extent of hydraulic fracture propagation are predominantly controlled by the in-situ stress state of reservoirs. We conducted distinct element method-based numerical simulations to explore the behavior of hydraulic fracture propagation and containment under varying in-situ stress conditions and fluid injection rates. The results revealed that even a small contrast of minor principal stress between pay-zone and adjacent bounding zones can cause a significant hydraulic fracture containment. Simulations performed under different injection rates showed that the hydraulic fracture containment is also influenced by the injection rate and higher injection rates tend to increase the hydraulic fracture penetration into the adjacent bounding zones. Overall, the results of the present study generally suggest that the fracture propagation during hydraulic fracturing is not an unconstrained event as one would imagine and natural barriers such as varying in-situ stresses, which are common in deep reservoirs, often limit fracture propagation to a certain finite extent. In addition, operational conditions such as fluid injection rate can be selected appropriately to control the hydraulic fracture propagation into unproductive bounding strata.
1. Introduction
Hydraulic fracturing is used to enhance oil and gas recovery from unconventional reservoirs since few decades ago. The same technique is also used in applications such as geothermal energy extraction, CO2 geo-sequestration and management of high stresses encountered with deep mining [1]. The direction and extent of hydraulic fracture propagation play important roles in the economics of oil and gas production projects. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the geometrical nature of hydraulic fracture propagation under reservoir conditions is imperative for successful hydraulic stimulation designs.
In-situ stress field in deep reservoirs is highly variable in nature. This cannot be explained by the effects of gravity and topography alone, for which the role of tectonic stresses is undeniable [2]. The state of the in-situ stress is one of the primary factors to be considered in design and implementation of hydraulic fracturing treatments [3, 4, 5]. Two fracture propagation models have been widely used for hydraulic stimulation designs of oil and gas reservoirs - (1) KGD model [6, 7] and (2) PKN model [8, 9]. Each model was developed based on different simplified assumptions and with certain limitations meaning that the user should carefully apply them with a sound understanding of these stipulated conditions. PKN model assumes an elliptical fracture cross section in the vertical plane and the formation stiffness is concentrated in the vertical planes perpendicular to the direction of fracture propagation while KGD model assumes a rectangular cross section in the vertical plane and the stiffness of the formation is concentrated in the horizontal plane [10]. The numerical simulation program of this study is compatible with the assumptions of the KGD model and thus further discussions are only limited to the KGD model. As Meyer [11] states, for a hydraulic fracture with unit height, the fracture length (lt) and aperture width at the wellbore (wt) can be expressed as shown in Equations 1 and 2, respectively, assuming zero leak-off into the formation (see Figure 1).|","hydraulic fracturing,  numerical modelling,  in-situ stress,  in-situ stress,  numerical modelling,  numerical modelling,  in-situ stress, hydraulic fracturing, hydraulic fracturing"

Deep mining, driven by the increasing need of the sustainable use of mineral resources, yields a chance to exploit untapped resources. Nevertheless, large depths remain challenging and complex environment, posing geotechnical risks such as stress driven damage. The violent damage mechanisms in deep mines are spalling and strainburst in their most severe forms. Real-time monitoring can not only assist in preventing a failure, but can also assist in post failure mitigations. It can help identify the possible systemic failure of adjacent areas and can therefore help in evacuating people and machinery from these areas. The long-term goal is to develop a real-time risk management concept for intelligent deep mines. The objective of this paper is to summarize the outcomes of I2Mine and DynaMine, formulate a risk concept suitable for real-time analysis and to produce a tangible measure of the risk levels. In this paper the Fault Tree - Event Tree methodology is proposed and an example is worked out using strainburst as an example risk case. The proposed methodology seems to work well and using a scenario with both property damage and ore loss, the risk expressed as financial consequences multiplied with probability drops from ˆ 88,000 to ˆ 11,000 corresponding to a – 80 % reduction in risk. The financial consequences together with the associated risk level can be expressed visually using a modified FN graph with financial loss on x-axis and probability on the y-axis. The developed geotechnical risk management concept suits the need of semi-automated or fully automated risk management. It would fit well in the analysis stage of the raw data and would produce a stress state change, which could be used as input in the risk management chain for intelligent deep mines.
1. Introduction
The mineral resources are limited and mines are slowly expanding to tap into deeper deposits. With the increase of depth the transport costs and rock support costs increase. Massive extraction induces stresses and triggers seismic events. Failures in high stress conditions can have violent nature that aggravates mining conditions, threatens the mine stability and increases working hazards. The violent damage mechanisms in deep mines are rock spalling and strainburst in their most severe forms [1, 2]. Strainbursts are considered the most common rockburst type in deep underground excavations [3]. Typical indicators for high probability of strainburst are: increased depth of mining, contrasting rock types (e.g. hard and brittle rocks vs. weak and yielding), drill hole behaviour, geological factors (e.g. faults, fractures), the increase of rock noise, large excavations, sudden change in cross-section area, and the increase in microseismicity [4]. The severity of the failure depends on the ratio of far-field maximum stress (<U+03C3>1) and the short-term unconfined compressive strength of the rock (<U+03C3>c) [1]. Less violent and energetic spalling can start to occur when <U+03C3>1/<U+03C3>c > 0.2 [1]. In mining conditions, it might be hard to recognize the difference between progressive spalling failure and violent strainburst as both cause a clear notch in a tunnel perimeter and can induce seismic event that can be recorded only if a mine is equipped with a microseismic network. Risk management tools and guidelines are essential to maintain safe and economically feasible extraction in the harsh underground environment, but they still need improvements. One opportunity identified here is the development of the real-time geotechnical risk management systems. The philosophy underlying this concept can be expressed by the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy introduced by Ackoff [5]. The author considers data as raw measurements, from which information is derived. Processed and analysed data is used for identification of data relationships that contribute to understanding. Understanding of data patterns and processed information provides knowledge. On the top of the DIKW hierarchy there is wisdom that represents the decision-making based on the knowledge gained. The Innovative Technologies and Concepts for the Intelligent Deep Mine of the Future (I2Mine) project running under the 7th Framework Program of the European Union produced useful tools that reflect the abovementioned hierarchy. One of them that aim at use of the real-time data is the Dynamic Intelligent Ground Monitoring Internet Network (DIGMINE) capable of stress and seismic near-to-real time measurements and another is the Geotechnical Risk Assessment (GRA) guideline developed to tackle the geotechnical risks in underground mines [6, 7, 8]. In this paper the review of these is given and an expansion of the GRA with the outcome from the Dynamic Control of Underground Mining Operations (DynaMine) project is proposed. The paper discusses the use of financial parameters as means of measuring tolerable and intolerable risk. With the use of Fault - Tree, Event Tree and F – N Diagrams [9, 10], a conversion of geotechnical risk into monetary values and comparing it with pre-set financial targets is proposed. This knowledge can then be used to support a decision-making process for strainburst risk management in underground mines.|","real-time data,  risk assessment,  rock stress,  rock stress, Deep underground hard rock mines,  risk assessment,  real-time data,  inverse calculation,  real-time data, Deep underground hard rock mines, Deep underground hard rock mines,  rock stress,  inverse calculation,  inverse calculation,  risk assessment"

We examine the stability of an ancient slope located at Jietai Temple in western Beijing of China, by using the remote monitoring system of sliding force combined with the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM) as well as the field surveys. Potential pre-existing joints in the slope were firstly determined by the in situ study and rock mass mechanical properties were then estimated to be taken as input parameters in the numerical modelling, for understanding the instability mechanism of the slope. Results from this synthetic assessment together with the monitoring data suggest that current protection measures in the slope may not be sufficient so that the local authorities should define hazard zones and work out further development plans for the Jietai temple.
1. Introduction
Limit equilibrium method and numerical modelling techniques are the most commonly used methods in the evaluation of slope stability. To complex rock and soil slopes, numerical approaches such as finite element and finite difference methods may be more suitable due to their flexibility when applied to simulate in situ stresses, loading condition, and multi-field interactions. Even though numerical modelling of rock slopes is commonly implemented by continuum approaches [1–4], features such as fracture, fragmentation, and crack propagation within rock mass extended to a computer code is very much appreciated to better describe the unstable process characteristics of rock slopes. The underlying geological data including fault, joint, foliated structure, and underground water table are required to be as the input parameters in the model to determine and calibrate the mechanical properties of rock masses in the numerical modelling of rock slopes. These in situ data together with monitoring information can further help to improve numerical modelling for providing the more reasonable prediction of the failure behaviours of rock slopes [5–7].
In the present report, we examine the stability of an ancient slope located at Jietai temple in western Beijing of China (Fig. 1) by using the field investigation, the monitoring technologies, and the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM) [8].

In situ stress is an important parameter in rock mechanics, thus robust estimation of far-field stress to be used as boundary loadings for further rock engineering analysis based on the local in situ stress data seems indispensable. Here, as part of a preliminary investigation into this problem, we use the combined finite-discrete element method to examine how the mean of local stress tensors is related to the far-field stress. We have conducted a series of stress simulations on a model of a fractured rock mass subjected to various boundary loadings, and calculated the Euclidean mean of the stress data and compared them with the boundary loadings. The results shows that the Euclidean mean and boundary loadings are approximately equal, which gives us an indication that the Euclidean mean of the stress data can be a reasonable estimation of the far-field stress.
1. Introduction
Unlike artificial materials like concrete and steel, natural materials such as rock masses are initially stressed in their natural state, mainly due to the weight of overlying strata and tectonic effects [1]. Thus, in situ stress is an important parameter in many aspects of rock mechanics, including rock engineering design, hydraulic fracturing analysis, rock mass permeability and earthquake potential evaluation [1–5]. In these stress-related applications, robust estimation of far-field stress based on the local in situ stress data seems indispensable. However, local values of the in situ stress field within a fractured rock mass may display considerable variability, and so determining the value of the far-field stress to be used as input or boundary loadings for further rock engineering analysis is difficult [1–3, 5].
Here, as part of a preliminary investigation into this problem, we use the combined finite-discrete element method (FEMDEM) to examine how the mean of local stress tensors is related to the far-field stress. We first explain the calculation of mean stress [6] and illustrate the rock mass model establishment for the FEMDEM simulation. Then, for the rock mass subjected to various boundary loadings, we calculate the means of stress data extracted from the model and compare these with the far-field stress. As a result we are able to give suggestions for the selection of appropriate far-field stress or boundary loadings for further rock engineering applications based on local in situ stress measurement data.|","far-field stress,  stress heterogeneity,  stress heterogeneity, stress tensor,  FEMDEM,  boundary loadings, stress tensor,  Euclidean mean,  FEMDEM,  boundary loadings,  FEMDEM,  boundary loadings,  Euclidean mean,  Euclidean mean, stress tensor,  far-field stress,  stress heterogeneity,  far-field stress"

Mining depth, geological dislocations and mining remnants are factors which affect the rockburst hazard during underground mining to the greatest extent. This hazard can be minimized by employment of active rockburst prevention, where long-hole destress blasts in roof rocks (torpedo blasts) have an important role. The main goal of these blastings is to either destress local stress concentrations in rock mass and to fracture the thick layers of strong roof rocks to prevent or minimize the impact of high energy tremors on the excavations. Sometimes, these blastings are performed to make the roof rocks caving behind the longwall face easier. The efficiency of blasting is typically evaluated from the seismic effect, which is calculated based on seismic monitoring data (seismic energy) and the weight of the charged explosive. This method, as used previously in the Czech Republic, was adopted in a selected Polish hard coal mine in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. This method enables rapid and easy estimation of destress blasting effectiveness, adjusted to conditions occurring in the designed colliery. Destress blasts effectiveness may be evaluated via the seismic source parameters analysis as well, as was carried out in the selected colliery in the Polish part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. These parameters provide information, for example, on its size, state of stress and occurrence of slip mechanism in the source of provoked tremors. Long-hole destress blasting effectiveness in selected colliery has been evaluated using the seismic effect method and seismic source parameters analysis. The results were compared with each other and conditions were observed in situ. |1. Introduction |Rockburst is a dangerous phenomenon occurring during deep underground hard coal mining in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB). To minimize this hazard, special prevention techniques are applied. One of them are destress blasts in the rocks surrounding the coal seam, especially in roof rocks. The main purpose of such blasts is to reduce stress concentrations in these rocks, and to reach a new advantageous energy equilibrium state by the rock mass due to stress drop. Fracturing the thick layers of strong roof rocks to prevent or minimize the impact of high energy tremors on the excavations is important too. Sometimes blasts are performed to facilitate roof rocks caving and goaf formation. Hanging-up of strong roof rocks behind longwall face may be responsible for high-energy tremors occurrence in close distance from the longwall face, which is dangerous for the working crew.|","long-hole destress blasting, active rockburst prevention,  seismic source parameters,  seismic source parameters, active rockburst prevention,  seismic source parameters,  seismic effect,  seismic effect,  seismic effect,  long-hole destress blasting, active rockburst prevention,  long-hole destress blasting"

With mechanized shield tunnelling the quality of the backfill is of significant importance for the stability of the lining. The used material affects the interaction between support and rock mass. Therefore, the choice of a proper backfilling material is of great importance for the system behaviour.
Scaled model tests have shown the relocation behaviour of pea gravel within the annular gap. The tests have shown that especially with Double shielded TBMs a distinct relocation mechanism is triggered by the regripping process. This leads to an unfavourable bedding situation immediately behind the TBM shield.
Based on a concept study two design improvements have been developed to improve the bedding situation. The first one is based on using geotextile tubes around the lining segments which also prevents a large-scale relocation process of pea gravel within the annular gap. The basic idea of the second concept is the use of ductile support elements with yielding potential in radial direction. Both systems solely differ in the fixation leading to different load cases of the lining. Due to the clamping mechanism, the forces acting on the yield elements are transformed into indirect tensile stresses around the element within the lining.
1. Introduction
Due to higher advance rates and an increasing level of automation the application of tunnel boring machines has significantly increased over the last years. In order to support the excavation boundary, precast reinforced lining segments are applied for shield TBM driven tunnels. To provide an interaction between the segmental lining and the surrounding ground, the annular gap (see Fig. 1) head has to be backfilled [1, 2].
Shield tunnel boring machines can be categorized into single and double shield machines. While single shield machines produce its thrust force by using thrust cylinders pushing against the segmental lining, double shielded machines are also capable of using grippers independently. This leads to the advantage that the support can be installed during the cutting process. Therefore, higher advance rates can be achieved. However, this leads to a higher logistical effort and less time for individual working steps. Hence, decreasing time for the backfilling process is available. Therefore, a complete backfill of the segmental lining might not be established after each ring closure, leading to an incomplete bedding within the annular gap. Furthermore, the regripping process of a double shield machine abruptly moves the shield tail, which also represents the abutment of the bedding material. Hence, a relocation of pea gravel is triggered within the annular gap, leading to an unfavorable bedding condition.|","segmental lining, segmental lining,  pea gravel,  mortar,  TBM,  mortar,  bedding,  pea gravel,  bedding,  bedding,  pea gravel,  mortar,  TBM, segmental lining,  TBM"

The purpose of this review is to present the state-of-the-art methods, problems and potential future design techniques used for rock engineering in frozen ground, with particular regard to the design of mine openings in rock masses that may be subject to thawing. The impetus for this work is the recognition that civil and mining infrastructure is extending into such frozen material, and the design procedures currently available may not be optimal. Additionally, civilian infrastructure in frozen ground in alpine regions (e.g. central Europe) is also becoming subject to thawing conditions. In any such scenario, increased heat exchange with an exposed rock mass surface will cause thawing to occur. In general, a rock mass is stronger in frozen conditions than in dry conditions (i.e. without ice or water), but a rock mass will be least strong at the time ice-filled discontinuities are thawing, resulting in a significant shear strength reduction. In this review, we will discuss the various existing design methods in the context of the phenomena involved in the formation of frozen rock and the behaviour of thawing rock. We will show the deficiencies of these methods and highlight potential developments that will lead to future robust design protocols.
1. Introduction
Although research on permafrost began in the first half of the eighteenth century, the study of permafrost as an applied science (known as geocryology) began in the late nineteenth century when industrial development was accelerating in northern Russia. Applied research in permafrost was required to develop railways, mining operations, as well as to protect civil structures from freeze-thaw damage [1]. One of the earliest documented cases of permafrost engineering was in 1876 on the use of artificial freezing, which was applied at Brunkeberg tunnel in Stockholm [2].
Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the study of permafrost was further accelerated by the energy industry as well as different military research institutions, most originating in Russia [1-5]. The second World War gave impetus to some of the first formal geotechnical investigations for mining and civil structures in frozen ground [2]. Furthermore, during the Cold War, permafrost research was of great interest for American and Russian military researchers, so much so that a permafrost tunnel was excavated and operated by the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CCREL) in Alaska. The CCREL were tasked with investigating mining techniques and how to maintain underground excavations in perennially frozen ground [5].|","frozen ground,  thawing rock behaviour, rock engineering design,  permafrost,  permafrost,  frozen ground,  frozen ground,  thawing rock behaviour, rock engineering design, rock engineering design,  permafrost,  thawing rock behaviour"

Coal burst is a sudden and violent rock/coal failure that occurs in underground coal mines. It is considered to be a highly catastrophic phenomenon which can cause significant damage to mine workings and equipment as well as result in multiple fatalities. Throughout the history of underground pillar design, the relation between the post-peak behavior of pillars and stiffness of the surrounding strata has been extensively studied. These two concepts play an important role in determining the failure mode of the coal pillars and the amount of potential energy that can be converted to kinetic energy, which is the cause of coal burst. In this paper, the post-peak behavior of pillars and surrounding strata stiffness are reviewed and the criterion developed to investigate the instability of the pillar failures is explained. It is concluded that, as the pillar width to mining height (w/h) ratio increases, its post-peak modulus increases; and a pillar exhibits different failure modes for various w/h ratios.
1. Introduction
Experiences in both hard rock and coal mines reveal that pillar failures are still one of the major hazards in underground mining and forecasting the mode of the pillar failure can be vital. Therefore, it is essential to fully understand the mechanics behind these failures in order to predict and control them. As suggested by Tincelin and Sinou [1], pillar failures can be classified into two categories:
i. Slow, progressive deterioration of the pillars that causes relatively delayed surface subsidence and even damage if the pillars fail,
ii. Sudden, violent collapse of pillar causing immediate surface damage and mostly associated with fatal accidents.
The first type of pillar failures is also named as controlled pillar failures which occur gradually and typically over long periods of time (i.e. pillar spalling). These pillar failures are also termed as creep and squeeze [2]. Uncontrolled pillar failures, on the other hand, take place in a sudden and violent manner and fall into the second group of pillar failures as described above. Since the uncontrolled pillar failures occur rapidly and may not be preceded by any deterioration of the pillars, they cause significant health and safety risks (e.g. coal burst, entrapment, windblast etc.) [2].|","uncontrolled pillar failure,  pillar burst, uncontrolled pillar failure,  coal burst,  coal burst,  pillar burst,  pillar burst, uncontrolled pillar failure,  coal burst"

Lugeon test is a popularly conducted field instrument in order to measure hydraulic conductivity of a rock mass. Discontinuity orientation, spacing and discontinuity surface quality, infill presence and type play essential role in permeability of the rock mass in addition to rock material itself. Geological Strength Index (GSI) is a parameter used in Gen. Hoek-Brown failure criterion and supporting empirical equations in order to estimate rock mass strength and deformability parameters. Frequently used Rock Quality Designation (RQD) and GSI and Lugeon values were combined in order to generate a relation among them. The proposed relationships are produced by interpretation of geotechnical core logging and Lugeon test results. |1. Introduction |Groundwater has great influence on rock engineering structures. Difficulties may include construction operations, rock mass deformation and stability. Hydraulic conductivity, pore water pressure, water pressure acting along the joints are all important as well as water sensitivity of the rock material. Understanding of groundwater condition is crucial for surface structures on rock masses, foundations, slopes [1, 2, 3]. For underground rock structures, information about ground water pressure and water inflow rate is essential [4, 5] since it strongly influences operational issues as well as stability of the structure and supports. Operational issues may include pump selection and infrastructure design for water discharge, foreseeing a need for grouting, water sealing. Permeability character of ground plays important role for also surface structures such as dams and foundations [6, 7]. |2.Hydraulic conductivity |For water flow through a saturated granular material, Darcy’s law [8] is widely accepted: |equation |Total flow (Q in m3/s) is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area of flow (A in m2), hydraulic conductivity (or called as coefficient of permeability in m/s) and hydraulic gradient i. i is a ratio of pressure difference (<U+0394>h) along a particular flow length (l in m) can be represented as: |equation |In addition to the intrinsic permeability of the geological material represented by ki, hydraulic conductivity, K is dependent on the fluid properties which are unit weight <U+03B3> and viscosity <U+03BC>: |equation|","hydraulic conductivity,  in situ tests,  rock mass,  in situ tests,  rock mass, hydraulic conductivity,  Lugeon test, hydraulic conductivity,  Lugeon test,  rock mass,  rock mass permeability,  in situ tests,  rock mass permeability,  rock mass permeability,  Lugeon test"

The Telfer underground sub-level cave (SLC) operations are located approximately 600 to 1000 m below the west wall of Main Dome open pit at the Telfer Gold Mine, Australia. The Telfer SLC commenced caving in 2006 and broke through to the surface in 2009 forming a large subsidence zone that has progressively developed above the SLC operation. Surface deformations within the subsidence zone continue at a rate of 500 mm to 2000 mm per month and are dependent to the rate of underground mining in the SLC operation. Underground and open pit operations have continued concurrently with the progressive enlargement of the SLC subsidence zone. The stage 4 open pit orebody was solely accessible via the West Ramp, which is located adjacent to the SLC subsidence zone with notable steady state ductile deformation occurring on ramp. Risks were managed by understanding the cave propagation mechanism through modelling and monitoring, and the use of comprehensive TARPs (trigger-action-response-plans) and an array of real-time surface and sub-surface deformation monitoring instruments. This paper discusses the monitoring systems used to track the cave subsidence and monitor ground deformation. These include slope stability radar, automatic total stations with survey prisms, shape-accel arrays, time-domain reflectometers, seismicity monitoring arrays, networked SMART markers, surface extensometers, automated crackmeters and monthly aerial surveys. These monitoring systems were used to determine the cave subsidence zone shape, location, rate of propagation and the direct response in the slopes adjacent to the West Ramp. The monitoring systems and TARPs are critical for identifying approaching hazards and taking proactive risk mitigation measures.
1. Introduction
Underground sub-level cave (SLC) operations commenced in 2006 and caving began to propagate towards the surface from approximately 800 m below the pit [1]. In preparation for the SLC operation, a large bench was established in preparation for the initial cave breakthrough area (i.e. ‘Breakthrough Bench’ or predicted subsidence crater extents) as illustrated in Figure 1a. In order to reduce the likelihood of future high wall instability above the subsidence crater, the Breakthrough Bench was backfilled with 1.1Mt of rock fill (Figures 1b & 1c). The life of concurrent open pit and SLC operations was anticipated to be a further five years.|","slope stability monitoring, Sub-level cave subsidence zone, Sub-level cave subsidence zone, Sub-level cave subsidence zone,  slope stability monitoring,  slope stability monitoring"

To this aim, a multi-sensor monitoring system has been installed in an abandoned quarry at Acuto (central Italy) to realise a natural-scale test site for detecting rock-falls from a cliff slope. The installed multi-sensor monitoring system consists of: i) two weather stations; ii) optical cam (Smart Camera) connected to an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system; iii) stress- strain geotechnical system; iv) seismic monitoring device and nano-seismic array for detecting microseismic events on the cliff slope.

The integrated monitoring system is devoted to record strain rates of rock mass joints, capturing their variations as an effect of forcing actions, which are the temperature, the rainfalls and the wind velocity and direction. The preliminary tests demonstrate that the data analysis methods allowed the identification of external destabilizing actions responsible for strain effects on rock joints. More in particular, it was observed that the temperature variations play a significant role for detectable strains of rock mass joints. The preliminary results obtained so far encourage further experiments. |1. Introduction |In the last few years, more attention has been focused on the monitoring of fast to very fast failures, which include landslides from rocky slopes, e.g. rock falls, topples and wedge sliding. The relevance of such events is mainly related to the short time available for taking action in the case of exposed infrastructures (i.e. highways and railways) as no significant displacements are generally detected before failure. To create a comprehensive detection strategy, a coupled monitoring system can be adopted: i) monitoring precursors by using micro- or nano-seismometric devices as well as acoustic emissions [1-3] and ii) monitoring the rock fall source areas as well as the threatened infrastructures, by using optical devices able to detect fast to very fast changes of the observed scenario or the presence of anomalous objects that can clutter the infrastructure [4-9].|","structure from motion technology, In-situ rock experiment,  multi-parametric monitoring system,  landslide risk management,  multi-parametric monitoring system, In-situ rock experiment,  structure from motion technology,  structure from motion technology, In-situ rock experiment,  landslide risk management,  multi-parametric monitoring system,  landslide risk management"

The North-German Basin offer at depth of approximately 5000 m sufficiently high temperatures for efficient and economic heat extraction by geothermal wells. The permeability of the carboniferous strata at that depth is very low so that conductive pathways have to be created by hydraulic fracturing. For some planned projects we conduct the characterization of the carboniferous strata as exposed in “analogous outcrops”. The geological setting for fracking is demanding, as the strata comprise strong sandstone, shale and weak coal seams. All necessary petrophysical properties will be collected by extended testing. The regional horst-and-graben system allows for mapping in outcrops and extrapolate the structural content towards the rock mass at depth.
1. Introduction
The North German Basin (NGB) is together with the Upper Rhine Valley and the southern Molasse basin the preferred area for deep geothermal wells in Germany Several commercial (Neustadt / Glewe) and research projects (GeneSys; Gro<U+03B2> Schonebeck) have been developed. The prognosis of temperatures at depth for Germany is shown in Figure 1. Some planned projects focus on the western part of the North Germany Basin and due to the fact that permeability of the target horizons at depth is very low fracking will be executed to create conductive pathways in the otherwise dry and hot rock. This type of heat mining is called Enhanced Geothermal System EGS which aims at producing electricity.
The red spots in Figure 1 suggest a temperature of around 180° C at a depth of 5000 m. This information seems to be valid since many oil and gas wells were drilled and still are operated in the NGB. We focus in this paper on the area near the border to the Netherlands, on the utmost western part of the NGB. Here several commercial projects are aiming for drilling deep wells and for executing multiple fracking from horizontal drillholes for obtaining high flow rates. This area is well known from exploration on hydrocarbon, 3D seismic lines have been executed and some deep wells have been drilled for exploitation.|","enhanced geothermal system,  rock chractacterization,  rock chractacterization, enhanced geothermal system, enhanced geothermal system,  structural characterization,  structural characterization,  rock chractacterization,  structural characterization"

A real-time monitoring system was established for 10-channel acoustic emission (AE) in hydraulic fracturing in the laboratory, with a hydraulic fracturing test conducted on two different sizes of natural outcrop cores under unconfined pressure and confining pressure respectively. Then, a discussion was carried out on the microscopic response in rock to the formation and growth of hydraulic fracture under confining pressure and unconfined pressure. The study of AE parameters shows that the change of RA (Rise Angle) in hydraulic fracturing process is always opposite to that of AF (Average Frequency). Also, AE parameters have higher dispersion under unconfined pressure. With breakdown pressure as a dividing point, as pumping pressure changes under unconfined pressure, the dominant internal fracture mechanism of rock will turn from tensile failure to shear failure. But under confining pressure, the transformation of the dominance is reversed, namely from shear failure to tensile failure. This phenomenon indicates that despite the same hydraulic fractures in macro scale under both confining pressure and unconfined pressure, there may be a large difference in microstructure between the hydraulic fractures formed under both pressure conditions respectively.
1. Introduction
Hydraulic fracturing technology has become the primary means of reservoir stimulation since its first application in North America in 1949 [1]. At present, as the conventional oil and gas resources are increasingly exhausted, and the yield of unconventional oil and gas resources rises gradually, hydraulic fracturing has grown into a more critical factor to artificial production’s increase [2]. From the perspective of theoretical research, with the constant development of fracture mechanics and its application to rock engineering, scholars have come to realize that the nonlinear areas have an important influence on the mechanical behavior of a hydraulic fracture before and after its formation, while the occurrence of micro cracks is an important sign of nonlinear rock failure [3].|","parameter analysis,  acoustic emission,  acoustic emission, hydraulic fracturing,  fracture mechanism,  parameter analysis, hydraulic fracturing, hydraulic fracturing,  acoustic emission,  fracture mechanism,  breakdown pressure,  breakdown pressure,  parameter analysis,  fracture mechanism,  breakdown pressure"

It is critical to obtain the rock strength along the wellbore to control drilling problems such as pipe sticking, tight hole, collapse and sand production. The purpose of this research is to predict the uniaxial compressive strength based on data of sonic travel time, formation porosity, density and penetration rate. For prediction of UCS, artificial neural networks were developed between UCS and input data resulting a practical correlation. In this research, a long well segment possessing complete and continuous data coverage has been analysed, and collected data of the wellbore are used to correlate data of the four mentioned input parameters of artificial neural networks with uniaxial compressive strength data as network targets. Selection of input parameters is based on a vast literature review in this area. Due to the fact that standard experimental test methods based on established standards require costly equipment and that the methods for sample preparation is difficult and time-consuming, indirect methods are more favourable. Using these methods, the UCS values are predicted in a simpler, faster and more economical way. In this study, it is concluded that artificial neural networks are a good predictor of rock strength, and can reduce drilling costs significantly. It is observed in this paper that UCS predicted values by neural networks are very close with lab and field data, which is concluded by analysis of network performance results including mean squared error and correlation coefficient. It is also concluded in this study that input parameters which are chosen in this study, have deep effects in UCS prediction studies, and should be considered in other scientific studies. Conclusions show that using artificial neural networks to predict UCS of formation rocks in petroleum fields around the world, would ease UCS estimation, optimize drilling plans and decrease costs.
1. Introduction
A geomechanical model requires a great deal of input information including measurements of magnitude of vertical and minimum stresses, pore pressure, rock mechanics properties and drilling experiences, all oriented to determine the magnitude of maximum horizontal stress. To conduct a geomechanical reservoir characterization, it is essential to have the knowledge of the in-situ stress magnitudes and rock mechanical properties [17].|","Artificial Neural Networks, Uniaxial Compressive Strength,  Wellbore Drilling,  Artificial Neural Networks,  Artificial Neural Networks, Uniaxial Compressive Strength,  Wellbore Drilling,  Wellbore Drilling, Uniaxial Compressive Strength"

The influence of discontinuities on the mechanical behavior of rock masses, demands a detailed knowledge about the geometrical properties of the existing discontinuity network. Traditional measurement techniques provide a rough knowledge about a discontinuity network but are also prone to bias. To increase the reliability of discontinuity models, remote sensing techniques like Close-Range Terrestrial Digital Photogrammetry (CRDTP) are increasingly applied for rock mass characterization. This research contributes to the trend of automatic rock mass characterization and focuses on the analysis of a digital surface model. This paper proposes a method to identify discontinuity sets in a point cloud and calculate the spacing of the sets. The discontinuity sets are semi-automatically identified with the open-source software DSE (Discontinuity Set Extractor). The program analyzes the density distribution of the point normal vectors in combination with a co-planarity test. The subsequent calculations apply DBSCAN to cluster and assign the points in the point cloud to singe discontinuity sets. After identifying the different discontinuity sets, the sub-members of each discontinuity set are again searched with DBSCAN in Matlab® (The Mathworks Inc.) and exported as a structure map to calculate the normal spacing between the single members of each set with ShapeMetriX3D Analyst. The point cloud is generated with CRTDP, using the digital mapping tool ShapeMetriX3D (3GSM GmbH), which is also used to validate the results of the calculations.
1. Introduction
There hardly exists a rock mass without three or more different discontinuity sets. Hence, it is of crucial importance in rock engineering to have a profound knowledge about the discontinuity network within a rock mass, since present discontinuities, like bedding planes, joints or cracks, represent the weak zones, which separate singular polyhedrons of competent rock blocks and control failure mechanisms. Furthermore, discontinuities influence the mechanical properties and the behavior of rock masses.
Geotechnical engineers traditionally acquire this data by geological and geotechnical surveys, which combine visual and manual technologies to characterize rock masses. The most common tool is a geological clino-compass to directly measure the dip and dip direction of discontinuities. This method can be extended by scan lines and mapping windows which reduce the inherent bias of a single measurement. But traditional geotechnical data acquisition is nonetheless limited in accessibility, geological or geotechnical knowledge, time and scale. The results are often subjective rather than objective and therefore not reproducible [1, 2].|","rock mass characterization,  spacing,  point clouds,  discontinuity analysis, rock mass characterization,  remote sensing,  point clouds, rock mass characterization,  point clouds,  remote sensing,  spacing,  spacing,  remote sensing,  discontinuity analysis,  discontinuity analysis"

In this paper, a numerical investigation of uniaxial compressive tests on prismatic specimens with single cylindrical pre-existing cavities in brittle rock is performed. To investigate the rock fracture around cavities and to assess the potential of the numerical model to simulate this behaviour, published laboratorial physical models on granite are simulated numerically with a Bonded- Particles Model (BPM) by using a distinct elements code. The numerical models are presented and the calibration of the BPM micro-parameters is described. Then, the calibrated numerical models are used to investigate the potential of the BPMs to simulate the fracture initiation and propagation of the physical specimens. It is concluded that the laboratory and the numerical observations are in good agreement.
1. Introduction
The bonded-particle model BPM [1] has extensively been used over the past decade to simulate the mechanical behaviour and fracture of rock under a variety of loading configurations. In the BPM, the intact rock is represented by a dense packing of rigid spheres (in 3D) or disks (in 2D) bonded together at their contacts. The model is implemented in the Particle Flow Code PFC [2]. The BPM has been extended by Potyondy (2010) [3] to form the Grain Based Model (GBM) in order to simulate a rock grain structure of deformable, breakable or not, polygonal grains, cemented along their adjoining sides. The GBM has been successfully used to describe the crack initiation, crack damage and peak strength of Dionyssos marble specimens under uniaxial compression [4]. However, more computational effort and extended calibration procedures are normally required to match the macroscopic rock behavior with the GBM. With the recent addition of the Flat-Joint contact logic in the BPM [5] particle interlocking and friction resistance at the contact are imposed, restricting the relative movement of particles, and thus attaining the advantages of simulating the rock structure.
In this study, the BPM is used to model the fracture initiation and damage around cylindrical openings in compression (e.g. [6-8]). Published laboratorial physical models on granite [6] are simulated numerically with the two-dimension Particle Flow Code PFC2D by using the flat-joint contact model.
During a uniaxial compression test on the aforementioned physical models, three (3) phenomena should be appeared. First, the primary fractures (denoted in Fig. 1 with red colour) initially start from the upper or lower hole’s boundary, extending upwards or downwards respectively. These fractures initiate due to the tensile stress concentration of the upper and lower regions of the hole’s boundary. Then, remote fractures (denoted in Fig. 1 with blue colour) away from the hole are formed on regions with high stress concentration, extending upwards and downwards. The angle of their formation and appearance is depended of the examined material’s characteristics. Finally, slabbing initiation (denoted in Fig. 1 with green colour) on the inner surface at the left and right hole’s boundary is observed, due to the high compressive stress concentration on these regions. The more the material is brittle, the more apparent are the V-shaped notches at the left and right of the hole.|","BPM,  Rock fracture, BPM, BPM,  Rock fracture,  Numerical simulation,  Numerical simulation,  Numerical simulation,  Rock fracture, Granite, Granite, Granite"

The results of physico-chemical characterization of limestone samples come from the Mesosoic limestone deposit areas in the region of Berbera (Republic of Somaliland) were reported in this paper. The chemical analysis was carried out by X-ray fluorescence analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The physical characterization of limestone samples were performed in laboratory conditions. This investigation provided necessary data for subsequent utilization and exploitation of limestone in this region. The tested material is a good quality and purity. From the chemical composition point of view the tested limestone has a high content of about 96% CaCO3, with small amount of clay minerals and with traces of quartz, which corresponds to the medium purity limestone. It was confirmed, that this limestone is suitable for cement production. The density and porosity measurement indicated that the medium to high density limestone is very compact with porosity lower than 4%. These data very good corresponds to relatively high Young's modulus up to 48 200 MPa and maximum strength of 204 MPa.
1. Introduction
Republic of Somaliland (Northwestern Somalia) is situated on the northern side of the Horn of Africa. From the geological point of view the country is comprised mainly by Mesozoic and Tertiary continental-margin and marine sedimentary rocks deposited unconformably on Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks [1]. The Berbera plain is a wide down-faulted sector, parallel to Somaliland coast along the Gulf of Aden, limited towards the south by high fault of the Precambrian crystalline basement forming the high mountains [2]. The basement in Berbera plain is covered by a thick Meso-Cenosoic sedimentary succession, including marine limestone facies (Fig. 1).
In the early 1980s, a cement plant became operational at Berbera in Somaliland, however, the lack of proper maintenance, shortage of spare parts, lack of managerial staff and skilled workers during the civil war caused the closure of this plant and termination of cement production [4]. National cement consumption was estimated to be about 250 000 metric tons in 2012 [5], in view of this fact some plan to restart the country's only cement plant at Berbera in Somaliland appears in recent time.|","limestone,  geotechnical properties,  Berbera (Republic of Somaliland),  chemical composition, limestone,  geotechnical properties,  Berbera (Republic of Somaliland),  geotechnical properties,  chemical composition, limestone,  chemical composition,  Berbera (Republic of Somaliland)"

The practical algorithm for determination of burst hazard zones using data from an automated system of mining pressure control is suggested. A procedure of an emergence prognosis is designed using the index of burst hazard, KUD, that characterizes the geo-mechanical state of rock stratum. A computer experiment is presented which illustrates the possibility of a suggested prognosis procedure.
1. Introduction
The field development and underground mining works at difficult geological conditions and at great depths requires the effective methods and tools of prognosis and prevention of the manifestations of rock pressure, the most dangerous form of which are rock and rock-tectonic bursts. To predict the dangerous manifestations of rock pressure, multi-channel automated geo-mechanical monitoring systems are widely used in the global mining practice. In Russia, the geo-acoustic measuring complex ”Prognoz ADS” is installed on a number of burst hazard fields [1, 2]. It operates to measure and process the parameters of the geo-acoustic activity, which reflects changes in processes of deformation and redistribution of stresses in the rock massif under the influence of mining.
To identify the potentially bump hazardous areas in rock massif where the sites of destructive geodynamic phenomena are formed, we used / applied the cluster analysis methods. Algorithm of determination of potentially hazardous areas is based on graph theory. It uses a representation of observations in the form of a graph, whose nodes are the point sources of sound. We introduce edges in the graph, if the ”distances” between two points are smaller than some critical value. The graph connectivity components characterize the attribution of micro seismo-acoustic events to clusters. The initial data for the clusters construction is an array of coordinates of the point sources of sound. Thus, these data allow us to create a film that shows the dynamics of the development of hazard zones.
To implement this algorithm, the software was developed which traces the formation of the sites of destructive geodynamic events in rock massif according to seismo-acoustic monitoring. The software analyzes the information after a certain interval of time and identifies potentially dangerous areas. Graphical output of software is represented interactively as 3D images. The size and displacement of the zones found can be assessed. The proposed algorithm and software in conjunction with the automated system of geo-mechanical monitoring were tested in the mining industry in the Far Eastern Russia and has shown to be effective for the identification of potentially hazardous areas in the mountain range. A preliminary version of the algorithm is presented in [3].|","A burst hazard zone,  a connectivity component a non-directed graph, A burst hazard zone, A burst hazard zone,  a connectivity component a non-directed graph,  a connectivity component a non-directed graph"

A first attempt of using the Room and Pillar mining method in the Czech Republic was implemented in the southern part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. This stratigraphical unit is well known for its complex geological structure with more than 40 main coal seams vertically distributed in the area of about 122 km2 of active mines and a complex slide/overlap fault system. The fact that the extraction of coal by this method is realised at a depth around 900 m below the surface has also made it one of the deepest Room and Pillar mining sites in the world. These facts brought lead to several questions. The main question connected to sustaining the safety of the workers before and after the advance of the mining works has resulted in this study of the prediction of unnatural seismological activity based on data that were collected during and after the excavation of the coal seam. Also, we ask whether the methods can be used for the prediction of inhomogeneous stress distributions in this kind of openings. Seismological monitoring, which is the main goal of this paper, was supplemented by stress and deformation measurements in coal pillars and surrounding rocks. More stations were added to the network of seismic stations of the coal mine at different levels surrounding the Room and Pillar site. We give the first results of the evaluation of seismic activity during the driving of the roadway in the first mining panel. We describe the site and mining conditions, details about seismological network, and a comparison of seismic activity with the gate driving advance and creation of coal pillars. This is compared to stress changes in the coal pillars.
1. Introduction
Coal mining is still one of the most dangerous branches of all working environments. One of the most useful ways to observe or predict potential rock/coal burst hazardous areas within the rock mass in which mining operations are situated is to monitor the seismological activity in the demarcated area [1]. It is essential to identify the part of the rock mass where there is a higher number of high-energy tremors, or the part with a specific local accumulation of low- and high-energy seismic events [2]. In the Czech part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB), a new way of extracting hard coal, the Room and pillar method (R&P), was presented and designed to be put into action for first testing. The R&P mining method as presented was used for the first time in a 200-year history of extracting hard coal in the region of the southern part of the USCB. For the time being the selected mining site, with a depth of around 900 m below the surface in which the extractions are made, makes this the deepest Room and Pillar mining site in the world.|","Mining Geomechanics, Room and Pillar, Room and Pillar,  Induced Seismological Activity, Room and Pillar,  Induced Seismological Activity,  Induced Seismological Activity,  Mining Geomechanics,  Mining Geomechanics"

Rock mass behavior is controlled mainly by weak planes in sedimentary rocks. Geomechanical model tests were conducted for simulating tunnel excavations in horizontal, the 45° and vertical inclined rock strata. Infrared thermography was employed for detecting rock responses during the excavations. Infrared temperature (IRT) curve obtained by averaging the matrices of the infrared sequence can be viewed as temporal observation of the overall energy release from the rock under excavation. The IRT curve characterizes the horizontal and vertical strata as linear behavior and the 45° inclined strata as piecewise linear behavior over the full-face excavation and the three strata as plastic-like behavior over the staged excavation, respectively. The constitutive heterogeneity can be represented by the Weibull modus obtained by curve-fitting to the Weibull model using the probability distribution of the IRT temporal observations. The vertical strata has the smallest Weibull modulus values corresponding to the higher heterogeneity compared with the else two strata models. The structural response of the rock under excavation was characterized by the IRT distribution of the infrared image. IRT distribution of the horizontal strata evolved from scattering distribution to localized high-temperature zone around the face. In contrast, IRT distribution for the 45° and vertical strata distributed as belt-like IRT parallel to the weak surface; indicating the frictional sliding damage mechanism. Most intense friction was observed in the excavation in the 45° inclined rock strata.
1. Introduction
Sedimentary rocks cover the majority of earth’s surface and are frequently encountered in underground mining. In the sedimentary rocks, two main sources of discontinuities are beddings and joints. The beddings can be assumed continuous over areas greater than that of any designed excavation and joints, however, are typically constrained between beddings [1]. Both beddings and joints are surfaces of relatively low shear and negligible tensile strength. Under the condition of stratified rock masses stretching across the roadway section, the engineering geological behaviour during tunnel development and operation is mainly controlled by the characteristics of the stratification planes [2]. Thus, existence of the discontinuities may exert a significant impact on the stability of the surrounding rock masses.|","Tunnel excavation,  Tunnel excavation,  Excavation damaged zone,  Tunnel excavation,  Sedimentary rocks,  Infrared detection,  Excavation damaged zone,  Excavation damaged zone,  Infrared detection, Geomechanical model test,  Sedimentary rocks,  Sedimentary rocks,  Infrared detection, Geomechanical model test, Geomechanical model test"

Young modulus is one of a basic geo-mechanical parameters used for the defining of the phenomena in rock mass. It is determined based on a uni-axial compressive test. According to the International Society of Rock Mechanics one may calculate it in three different ways as the tangent, secant and average modulus. This discretion causes, as the result that one can obtain results, which differ from each other significantly, even threefold or more.
The laboratory tests for Carboniferous rocks: claystones, mudstones, sandstones and coals are presented in the paper. The modulus value distributions for the recommended methodology were compared using statistical analysis. The typical range of the elastic linear deformability for the chosen rock types was determined. Thus the evaluation of the best Young modulus determination method was performed. Tangent Young modulus was recommended as the guiding one, studied with the range of 25-75% of ultimate stress. 503 rock samples have been investigated for this analysis.
The elastic behaviour of rocks and the range of their elasticity are of crucial importance in rock engineering. In solving problems in mining engineering or tunnelling, the change of stress fields forced by an excavation drivage first depends on the elastic and then the post-failure properties of rock. Hence, determining the rock mass properties appropriately is of crucial importance for a roadway stability evaluation and support design. Among elastic rock properties one may mention: Young’s modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus and Poisson’s ratio. As the shear modulus and bulk modulus are functions of Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio the last two parameters are the most important in solving geo-mechanical problems. Some authors even emphasise, that elastic modulus becomes a critical parameter to describe the rocks’ behaviour under load because of their brittleness [1, 10]. All numerical models for stress and deformation analyses such as FLAC, PHASE or UDEC use Young’s modulus for solving rock engineering problems [11]. Young’s modulus is also a base to derive a deformation modulus of blocky and jointed rock masses, which are non-elastic.|","rock mechanics, rock mechanics,  Young's modulus,  range of elasticity,  laboratory rock tests,  laboratory rock tests,  range of elasticity, rock mechanics,  range of elasticity,  Young's modulus,  laboratory rock tests,  Young's modulus"

Boreability can be defined as the ability of a bore to penetrate a rock mass. Understanding the factors influencing boreability is critical for enhanced project planning and reduce geotechnical risk in an offshore shaft boring environment. Large diameter drills are used for offshore shaft boring, which can be up to 7 m in diameter, and therefore more akin to tunnel boring machines due to the scale of the excavation and extent of ground interaction. With increases in bore diameter, there is a need to properly define and evaluate the effect of the degree of rock mass fracturing on machine performance for improved estimates of boreability. Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) simulation has been used as an innovative approach for stochastic realisation of rock mass fracturing by determination of the P32 volumetric fracture intensity in the context of boreability. P32 shows positive trend to specific penetration (SP), with maximum SP being achieved at moderate to high fracturing levels (20 – 25m<U+2212>1). However, in this case, P32 shows a similar positive trend to P10, but with peak SP appearing at higher intensity levels. Increased RQD values result in reduced SP, with peak SP reached at moderate fracturing levels, similar to P10.
1. Introduction
Boreability is defined as the ability of a machine to penetrate a rock mass [1], and is commonly associated with Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM). The development of offshore shafts, Large Diameter Drills (LDD) are utilized, which feature similar tools or technology to that of oil well drilling with reverse circulation system for muck removal. The size and scale of ground interaction can be up to seven meters, making these type of LDD’s more akin to tunnel boring machines due to their scale. Little research has been undertaken on the performance or boreability of LDD’s when compared to evaluation of TBM behavior. Given that the underlying excavation process and ground interaction tools differ between LDD and TBM machines, TBM performance can only therefore be used as a proxy rather than direct comparison.|","Offshore Drilling, Boreability,  Discrete Fracture Network, Boreability,  Discrete Fracture Network,  Discrete Fracture Network, Boreability,  Offshore Drilling,  Offshore Drilling"

In China, engineering geological disasters are frequently encountered in the underground mining sites where room and pillar method is used. This paper presents a novel method for developing the gateway tunnel without any excavation using directional tension blasting (DTB) in the mine panels. The mining-induced stress transfer will be blocked by cutting the roof stratum with a slit produced by DTB. The method has the following advantages: 1) forming the gateway tunnel without any excavation work; 2) de-stress, and 3) reducing the number of the pillars significantly. The DTB has been applied in many giant coal mining corporations in China and proved to be very helpful in 1) increase in productivity and reduction in costs dramatically, and 2) elimination of engineering geological disasters induced by the coal pillar and mining stress.
1. Introduction
Room and pillar method is the major mining way in china. The shallow coal resources are gradually reducing along with the continuously mining, which leads to the rising of mining depth. But engineering geological disasters, especially large deformation problem of surrounding rock, which is much more serious than that in shallow mines, are frequently encountered in deep underground mining sites. According to incomplete statistics, around 80 %~90 % accidents occur at the deep gate road [1, 2], and 80 %~90 % among them happen in roadway along gob.
In order to reduce tunnel excavation, non-coal pillar mining with reused roadway method was developed with the improvement of surrounding rock control theory and support technology. It can reuse the last sublevel of mining roadway for the next sublevel along the edge of gob. And this technology can eliminate the island mining face, alleviate the continuous tension of workface, reduce the amount of roadway excavation, realize reciprocating mining, improve the coal recovery rate [3], and it was widely used in coal mine enterprises at home and abroad. At present, the main research is based on the caving method, which focuses on the wall supporting form and resistance, the determination of filling materials and the optimization design of supporting parameters and so on [4-7].|","cumulative,  cumulative,  gob-side entry retaining, Directional tension blasting,  gob-side entry retaining, Directional tension blasting,  roof cutting,  gob-side entry retaining,  roof cutting, Directional tension blasting,  roof cutting,  cumulative"

This methodology of hydraulic frac simulation is more robust in predicting post-frac production rates from fractured wells specifically in unconventional reservoirs like shales and has several advantages over utilizing frac models in isolation. The results from FEDS are compared with commercial frac simulators and discrepancies are noted. This workflow is divided in two segments, flow in frac (or reservoir) and flow in wellbore. The frac element is calculated through Quasi-3D frac model, a published hydraulic frac model that calculates frac geometry (frac length, width & height) in asymmetric multilayer formations such as Pakistan’s Shales. This calculation is used to estimate the dimensionless fracture conductivity (FcD) which is a measure of effectiveness of the frac. These calculations are combined with reservoir parameters such as pressure, permeability and skin to generate deliverability profile or Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR). This IPR generated from calculated fracture geometry & conductivity inherently accounts for uncertainty of formation stresses, frac height implications, effect of permeability variation etc. This is a numerically calculated IPR, while fracture growth is being modelled; IPR is constantly updated based on fracture model results in a fully coupled setting. Second element of wellbore hydraulics or Vertical Lift Performance (VLP) is calculated using several published correlations such as Gray et al. The idea behind incorporating VLP in frac simulation is to model effects of water holdup, slippage, multiphase flow etc. Most commercial frac simulators utilize correlations of FcD to estimate post frac production, such as cinco-ley et al correlation. However, often production at surface is hampered due to wellbore effects such as water slippage. This is one of the major reason, despite having reliable input data, design post frac profile is much higher than realized production. The working of this workflow is validated by applying on two field fracture treatments. One of this treatment is in conventional sandstone reservoir while other is unconventional. The design & post frac production prediction is conducted in published frac models (that are used by commercial simulators) and using Quasi-3D frac model in FEDS. In all cases, production predicted by FEDS is significantly lower than commercial simulators. Main frac treatment is conducted as per design in these two reservoirs and actual post frac production is measured. The instantaneous gas production from both reservoirs is in better agreement with production predicted by FEDS validating the calculations of this workflow.|","Document Type

Presence of natural fractures in reservoirs increases heterogeneity and modeling complexity while playing a significant role on well productivity and field recovery. Placing horizontal wells in naturally fractured tight carbonate reservoirs is extremely challenging due to the large variation in the natural fracture density and consequently in the formation permeability. To enhance and maintain production from such reservoirs, hydraulic stimulation is conducted to create new fractures and activate pre-existing natural fractures. However, during production/injection periods, poromechanical properties of the fractured reservoir might change with changing pressure and stress conditions. This affects ultimate recovery and results of future well placement and stimulation efforts. Changes in the properties, such as enhancement or reduction in permeability, also complicate computational modeling and performance forecasting of the reservoir. In this paper, we propose a framework to capture such flow-induced property changes in a fractured reservoir. 
Our framework is based on a sequential solution of three coupled problems: (1) mechanical deformation (2) fluid flow, and (3) fracture propagation. We use the finite element method to solve the quasi-static mechanical deformation problem, the finite volume method to solve the Darcy flow problem in the matrix, and a damage mechanics approach to model propagation of pre-existing spatially distributed fractures and the ensuing evolution in flow and mechanical properties of the reservoir. We use the fixed strain scheme to couple the mechanical problem with the flow problem sequentially. The two problems are coupled to the fracture propagation problem via stresses, pressure, elastic moduli, and permeability. 
The framework allows for coupled flow, deformation and damage in fractured reservoirs without the computational burden associated with an explicit fracture representation. This means we can obtain accurate predictions in realistic scenarios of production from heavily fractured and stress-sensitive reservoirs. Modeling these processes will also help in optimizing horizontal well placement decisions.|","Poromechanics, Coupled, Fracture, Simulation, Modeling"

This petrographic, stable isotopic and fluid inclusion microthermometric study revealed that the diagenetic and related reservoir quality evolution of the Upper Jurassic limestones across the studied field onshore Abu Dhabi, UAE, occurred during three phases, including: (i) near-surface to burial diagenesis, during which reservoir quality across the field was either deteriorated or preserved by calcite cementation presumably derived from marine or evolved marine pore waters. Improvement of reservoir quality was due to the formation of micropores by micritization of ooids and skeletal fragments and moldic/intragranular pores by subsequent dissolution of the peloids. (ii) Obduction of Oman ophiolites and formation of the anticline, which included gas migration and cementation of the crest and flank limestones by saddle dolomite and coarse calcite spar. High homogenization temperatures and salinity of the fluid inclusions, negative <U+03B4>18OVPDB values, saddle shape of dolomite, and the presence of exotic cements suggest that these carbonates were formed by flux of hot basinal brines, possibly related to the tectonic compression event. (iii) Rapid subsidence subsequent to the obduction, which resulted in extensive stylolitization and cementation by calcite. This calcite cement occluded most of the remaining pores of the flank limestones (water zone). The results suggest that gas emplacement: (i) halts deep-burial diagenesis but less diagenesis related to flux of hot basinal brines, and (ii) accounts for the better carbonate reservoir quality in the crest than flanks of the anticline. These findings, which have important implications for the fluid flow and hydrocarbon migration, relates for first time diagenesis and reservoir quality evolution to the burial and tectonic events of foreland basins in the Arabian Gulf area.|","Fluid evolution, Carbonates, Reservoir quality, Diagenesis"

Most unconventional reservoirs are characterized by an ultra-tight matrix and commercial production requires existence of a pervasive fracture network surrounding hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. Production behavior of fractured horizontal wells in these reservoirs is usually associated with natural-fracture dominated linear flow, which is diagnosed by a <U+00BD>-slope straight line on log-log coordinates. This paper shows that additional pseudotransient linear flow regimes are possible at late-intermediate times with the same conventional diagnostic features of linear flow. These flow regimes correspond to the physical conditions (i) where the flow in the matrix is pseudosteady while the natural fractures have transient flow or (ii) where the natural fractures experience boundary dominated flow concurrent with transient flow in the matrix. An analytical solution is provided with a suite of tools to analyze transient and pseudotransient linear flows. The solution is based on the trilinear model with a stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) idealized by the transient, dual-porosity slab assumption. The model is a proxy for some tight-oil plays, such as the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Niobrara, where thin layers of fractured carbonates providing the flow capacity are interbedded by layers of tight shale or marl, which act as the storage medium. Asymptotic solutions are derived for linear and bilinear flow regimes and conditions for their existence and start and end times are provided. Simulated examples indicate that confusing pseudotransient linear flow with the conventional linear flow creates up to three orders of magnitude differences in the estimates of permeability, fracture half-lengths, or the size of the SRV. Application of the analysis is also demonstrated on real data from an unconventional well.|","trilinear, natural fractures, extended flow, well testing, transient flow"

The objective of this paper is to summarize some good practices that must be in place to ensure that re-assigned geo-steering jobs run successfully. During recent years the amount of jobs that have been re-assigned to the BHGE from other Service Companies by the Drilling Team have increased significantly and were all executed successfully. This makes a strong statement, that re-assignment of jobs plays an important role in increasing the trust of the client to the services that are provided by BHGE. Job re-assignment typical results in optimized service and delivery not to mention the improved economics. 
Developed a procedure for collecting data and documented some of the re-assigned jobs we did and found out the keys that can make the tool excel in execution. This good practice will really be needed in order to make successful re-assigned job. The re-assigned job comes in to play due to service provider’s (1) Tool failure, (2) Wellbore instability that causes stuck-pipe and lost in hole, and (3) Inability to provide back-up tool after tool failure or lost in hole. The unsuccessful service and inability to understand the wellbore problems become the most significant contribution in losing the job to another company. Some good practices in executing the re-assigned job will be summarized and concluded in order to get the idea how to provide expected service to client. 
Integrated study from all aspect in drilling involving geo-steering engineer, geo-mechanic specialist, well planners, geoscientists, application engineers, workshop engineers, geologist, drilling engineer, drilling team and field engineer in location will enhance the ability to understand the situation in the hole and we will be able to provide faster decision how to execute the job successfully. Most of the re-assigned job initiated by wellbore stability issues in the hole, guide to another problem, and were not able to be recognized by the team in time. The second thing is series of tool failure and inability to provide the back-up tool in time. The last thing is the lack of service or unable to provide the service that is needed by the client. Successful execution in re-assigned job will increase the trust of the client to the tool and service, and also will become a good campaign in selling the service and make the client remember about our service quality. These findings will help service provider to learn about how to provide expected service and make a good decision while executing the re-assigned job.|","vibration, Geo-steering, Wellbore stability."

Samples of chalk are flooded with different brines to observe the reactivity of the material with determining and quantifying the mineralogical changes. The type of chalk, the composition of the fluid and the pressure and temperature conditions are varied to understand how these parameters impact fluid flow and compaction which surely is an important drive mechanism for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Changes in mineralogy affect porosity and permeability and controls compaction of a rock. This compaction is, in itself, an important drive for increased production of oil and the rock-fluid interaction is also believed to have a positive effect on altering the wettability of the rock towards more water-wet. We chose on-shore chalk (from Belgium, Denmark, USA) to compare results with reservoir chalk and to prepare pilot studies in chalk reservoirs and a homogenized, artificial core of 99.95% CaCO3-powder with micron-like grain sizes. The use of MgCl2 brines injected under reservoir conditions (130°C; 10-14 MPa effective stress) into drilled chalk plugs (diameter: 3,8cm; length: 7cm) produced significant effects in terms of mineralogical changes in chalk, which are studied by optical petrography, X-ray diffraction, whole-rock geochemistry, C-O isotope geochemistry, Mineral Liberation Analyzer (MLA), conventional scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive systems (SEM-EDS) methodology, electron microprobe analysis, nano-secondary ion mass spectrometry, micro-Raman and tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy coupled with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Tests have been carried out from weeks to a length of three years. Generally, we observe a mineralogical change from calcite to magnesite. Processes of dissolution, precipitation and re-precipitation are beyond doubt recognised. Mineral growth takes place after a short time of flooding with nano-scale Mg-rich carbonates, mostly as magnesite. Crystal boundaries between magnesite and calcite are sharp even on nano-scale (TEM). MLA shows that the mineralogical changes take place in two stages, one causes a mixture of Mg-rich carbonates (or magnesite) and calcite, while a second stage changes gradually the entire sample to nearly pure magnesite. Whole-rock geochemistry, TEM-EDS show that still c. 4wt.% of CaO is left in the altered chalk even after three years testing. MLA showed that the type of paleontological material alters in different velocities from calcite to Mg-rich carbonate (respectively magnesite) and that fossil debris hampers fluid flow. The observed mineralogical changes have a significant effect on porosity calculations, which implies that estimations of porosity in chalk without taking mineralogical changes into account are misleading. Results also showed that micro-Raman spectroscopy is capable of estimating MgO concentration in carbonates and identifying new grown mineral phases in a very quick, non-destructive, cheap, and effective way and that c. 4wt.% of CaO is left in the entirely altered chalk after three years of flooding.|","nano technology, flooding, chalk, EOR"

Thermal methods based on dielectric heating are of interest in several stimulation and production applications; however, most downhole fluids and rocks have uneven electromagnetic absorption. A potential solution is to create particles that can act as centers of electromagnetic absorption. These are known as enablers. In this technique, the rocks and fluids are not directly heated by the electromagnetic radiation; rather the enablers absorb the electromagnetic radiation, transform it into heat, and warm up the formation and fluids. This paper presents the numerical characterization of the thermal and geomechanical dynamics in this process as a function of different rock types and varying enabler distributions. 
The numerical analysis explored the dynamics of high-power electromagnetic radiation (HPEM) and revealed key optimization variables and interactions. The results provide new insights about the relations between the competing physics, and suggest how to control the coupling dynamics to enhance different applications. Ultimately, the techniques and results detailed in this work could prove essential to optimize the next generation of electromagnetic heating and recovery methods. 
Thermal and geomechanical modeling showed that the sudden increase in temperature across multiple points, could be used to enhance fracturing and induce other mechanical changes in the formation that are valuable for stimulation of tight formations. A comprehensive statistical analysis was used to determine key variables and optimal heating dynamics, as a function of volume and spatial distribution of enablers. It was observed that the efficiency of the energy transferred to the formation, depends on the volume and spatial distribution of the enablers within the rock matrix. The latter suggests that micro- and nano-particle size enablers could potentially improve heating and energy transfer for oil and gas applications.|","geomechanics, modeling, electromagnetic heating, laser, microwave"

Understanding the created fracture geometry is key to the effectiveness of any stimulation program, as fracture surface area directly impacts production performance. Microseismic monitoring of hydraulic stimulations can provide in real-time extensive diagnostic information on fracture development and geometry. Thus, it can help with the immediate needs of optimizing the stimulation program for production performance and long-term concerns associated to field development. However, microseismic monitoring is often underutilized at the expense of productivity in the exploration and appraisal phases of a field. 
Geology is a fundamental element in the design of a stimulation program and the interpretation of its results. Rock properties and geomechanics govern the achievable fracture geometry and influence the type of fluids to be injected in the formation and the pumping schedule. Rock layering controls the location of the monitoring device, guides the depth at which perforations should be located, and influences how hydrocarbons flow within the formation. Despite this importance, the impact geology may have on the stimulation results is often overlooked as it is all too common to see assumed laterally homogeneous formations, invariant stress field (both laterally and vertically), stimulated fractures having a symmetric planar geometry, etc. 
As exploration and appraisal moves toward active tectonics areas (as opposed to relatively quiet passive margins and depositional basins), understanding the impact of complex geology and the stress field on fracture geometry is critical to optimizing stimulation treatments and establishing robust field development plans. Mapping of hypocenters detected using microseismic monitoring is an ideal tool to help understand near- and far-field fracture geometry. Additionally, moment tensor inversion performed on mapped hypocenters can contribute to understanding the rock failure mechanisms and help with evaluating asymmetric and complex fracture geometry. Understanding this fracture complexity helps address key uncertainties such as achievable fracture coverage of the reservoir. 
We present the results of several hydraulic fracture stimulations in various geological environments that have been monitored using microseismic data. We illustrate with these case studies that in some rare cases, simple radial and planar fracture system (often mislabeled penny shape-like fracture) may be generated as predicted using simple modeling techniques. However, in most cases, the final fracture system geometry is complex and asymmetric, largely governed by stress, geologic discontinuities, rock fabric, etc. Understanding this impact and optimizing the well design to enhance productivity is key to evaluating reservoir potential and commercial viability during exploration and appraisal phases and for maximizing return on investment during development.|","hydraulic fracture, unconventional, microseismic, geology, rock quality"

A geomechanical evaluation and monitoring programs was conducted in order to reduce non-productive time and drilling complications while drilling in a tectonically stressed area of Kuwait. Offset wells had experienced problems related to the tectonic stresses and associated faults, fractures, complex structures, and anomalous pore pressure. Additional challenges were faced due to complicated and highly deviated well designs where planes of weakness in the formation being drilled and their relative angle with respect to the well path become crucial factors in assessing stability of the borehole. Multiple failure mechanisms such as stress induced wellbore instability, invasion of drilling fluids into weak bedding / micro-fractures and osmotic sensitivity, are found to be the root cause of wellbore instability across reactive shale and other problematic formations especially during drilling of highly deviated wells. 
To successfully achieve the above objective, it was prudent to be armed with proper assessment and understanding of wellbore stability along with optimizing the most appropriate drilling strategy. Five offset wells were assessed from Geo mechanical point of view in the area in order to simulate the back analysis of the borehole collapse in the unstable zones. The previous wells experience showed a high risk to drill the shales and depleted reservoir formation in one section, causing a high ECD in depleted reservoir which dramatically led to severe losses. 
The planned well was monitored in real time through the control of the ECD and drilling parameters. Since shales in that section are unstable and tend to be plastically deformed, high mud weights were typically used. Based on the geomechanical inputs of the wellbore stability while drilling, new casing strategy was formulated taking into-account the wellbore stability input, drilling parameters and the mud rheology. The shale section was isolated with separate casing and well was successfully drilled to TD without any drilling complications and minimum Non Productive time. 
Geomechanical modeling and real-time monitoring allowed the well operator to overcome serious drilling hazards and optimize the drilling practices. This application promises to open the prospect of drilling similar wells without complications and reduced NPT in Kuwait.|","Geomechanic, Stability, Wellbore"

Since the start of drilling campaign at new field in the United Arab Emirates the operator faced the challenge to drill across faults, what can lead to well control, wellbore instability, total losses and stuck pipe. To minimize the impact, a risk management plan was developed and implemented during drilling and completion stages, which allowed to execute wells in trouble-free manner. 
The operator gathered the respective teams (geomechanics, seismic, operation geologists, drilling engineering and operations) and service companies with the objective of understanding the nature and potential operational impact of the faults. Afterwards, a very detailed risk management plan (RMP) was developed, which included different options with mitigation measures on how to deal with losses. This included changes in the well design, drilling fluid, BHA and casing setting depth. The compromises and benefits of each scenario was worked until a primary option was determined. Also, detailed procedures in case of non-standard situations were developed with contingencies. 
Based on the measures developed as part of the risk management plan the drilling of the sections through the fault and completion (casing run, cementing, etc.) were conducted in trouble-free manner.

In the tight carbonate reservoir located in onshore Mexico, fault damage zones and associated fracture networks represent major permeability structure and greatly affect fluid flow. In this study, we present a method for characterizing and modeling fault damage zones and fracture networks. The main objectives are to use fault damage zone and fracture network models to predict fluid-flow pathways in the reservoir and to understand their impact on well production performance. 
Appropriate geometric attributes are used for unsupervised seismic facies classification with the aim of delineating fault damage zones. The utility of the facies approach lies in its capacity for classifying the fault system with distinct classes based on the degree of fracturing. The three-dimensional fault damage zones are extracted and modeled from the seismic facies volume. A natural fracture network model in the target formation is deterministically built by meshing fracture lineaments that are automatically tracked along depth slices of the edge-enhanced curvature attribute. The fracture network model provides fracture characters in terms of fracture orientation, length, density and connectivity. Local fracture network models at individual wells can be built using fracture connectivity analysis technique. 
The fault damage zone model delineates fault zone architecture and spatial variability. Our results show that the main fracture sets parallel or subparallel to the fault zone strikes regionally. Fractures distribute surrounding fault damage zones with enhanced fracture density. A good correlation between the fault damage zones and the lost circulation is observed. Based on the production data, fault damage zones can act as fluid conduits. In some instances, fault damage zones can create flow barriers. Conditioned with well data, the conductivity of the fault damage zones and related local fracture networks is calibrated. Using the local fracture network model, the fluid flow pathways and fracture vertical connectivity are determined. With borehole breakouts and drilling induced fractures, the identified maximum horizontal stress orientation is in the NNE direction. Our results show that the conductive properties of fault damage zones and fractures could be affected by the stress state and in situ stress orientations. This explains the fact that the wells located in the fault damage zones and fractures with the orientations preferable for extension tendency or slip tendency have high productivity. 
The continuous fault damage zone model and the discrete fracture network model can be used to capture 3-D complexity of fluid flow in fault damage zones, improve the prediction of flow pathways and help the lateral or horizontal well design.|","Tight Carbonate Reservoir, Fault Damage Zones, Influence on Fluid Flow, in situ stress orientations, Fracture Networks"

Offshore reservoirs are subjected to pressure loading from the ocean tide. The resulting pressure fluctuation, notably its amplitude and phase, provides valuable information about the formation compressibility and heterogeneity. The purpose of the present study is twofold: first to propose a method for calculating tidal efficiency from harmonic analysis of regional tide stations and detrended bottomhole pressure, and second to compare the compressibility from tidal analysis to that obtained from rock mechanics measurements and material balance. This case study is on a fractured oilfield for which matrix laboratory measurements alone cannot capture the large scale formation compressibility which is driven by the .fracture distribution. 
This paper will show how, in the absence of seabed pressure measurement, a synthetic diurnal tide can be simulated by interpolating the harmonic constituents of neighbouring tide stations. A new procedure combining Savitzky-Golay filter and cubic splines gave satisfactory results to filter out the tidal signal residual from the reservoir transient response. The tidal efficiency and pore pressure compressibility, computed through history for several wells, showed a clear correlation with the fracture tendancy. Also fluid effects, caused by higher water saturation in downdip wells or gas breakthrough, produce a clear signature on the tidal efficiency.|","pressure transient analysis, fractured reservoir, tidal effect, signal processing"

Achieving well integrity relies on achieving zonal isolation among narrowly separated sublayers of the reservoir throughout a long openhole section. This requires flawless primary cementation with a perfect match of optimized fluid design and placement. 
In a UAE field, there are several challenges experienced while cementing production sections, predominantly due to long open holes with high deviation, use of nonaqueous fluids (NAF) for shale stability, and loss circulation issues while drilling and cementing. The need to pressure-test casing at high pressures after the cement is set and the change in downhole pressures and temperatures during well completion / production phases result in additional stresses that can further endanger the integrity of the cement. Breaking of the cement sheath would lead to sustained annular pressure and compromise the needed zonal isolation. Hence, the mechanical properties for cement systems must be thoroughly tested and tailored to withstand the downhole stresses. 
A systematic approach was applied that used standard cementing best practices as a starting point and then identified the key factors in overcoming operation-specific challenges. In addition to the use of engineered trimodal slurry systems, NAF-compatible spacers, and loss-curing fibers, an advanced cement placement software was used to model prejob circulation rates, bottomhole circulating temperatures, centralizer placement, and mud removal. To enhance conventional chemistry-based mud cleaning and to significantly improve cleaning efficiency, an engineered fiber-based scrubbing additive was used in spacers with microemulsion based surfactant. Furthermore, a real-time monitoring software was used to compute and monitor equivalent circulating density (ECD) during the cementing operation and to evaluate cement placement in real time. Results of cement jobs were analyzed to define the minimum standards/criteria and then to verify the efficiency of the applied solutions. 
The 9 5/8-in. casing / liners were successfully cemented using this methodological approach, and lessons learned were progressively used to improve on subsequent jobs. Advanced ultrasonic cement bond logging tools along with advanced processing and interpretation techniques facilitated making reliable, conclusive, and representative zonal isolation evaluation. The cement bond logs showed significant improvement and increased the confidence level towards well integrity.

Few inverted-ESP-DF applications have been analyzed or reported. Accordingly, operators and technology providers have yet a lot to venture through and improve; in the aspects of inverted ESP design enhancements and concept utilizations. KOC's – North Fields are the first to actuate Cone Control Completions (CCCs) via inverted ESPs; attaining affectability levels never before achieved using conventional technologies. The concept of Cone Control technology is to create a pressure drawdown (<U+0394>P), just below the Oil Water Contact (OWC), marginally higher than the <U+0394>P across the perforated interval within the Oil leg. This drawdown retards the progression of the water cone, and can best be achieved using an inverted, bottom-discharge high-volume ESP. Inverted ESPs were selected after the limited success achieved from utilizing a shrouded conventional ESP with Y-tool in the original CCC implementation at KOC's - North Fields. The major limitations with this ESP configuration were casing size (can only be used in 95/8"" casings and larger; smaller casing sizes implied smaller ESP series of lower rate attainments), and injection rate restrictions (limited to 4,500 BPD, beyond which shroud erosion is expected). Inverted ESP's eliminated both constraints, and added the advantage of being shorter and more compact (as they are operating with gravitational forces), suitable for wells with higher dogleg severities.

Abu Dhabi Fields are showing the presence of several leads/prospects with a significant amount of hydrocarbon accumulations, where the faults provide the critical up-dip closure. The classical approach of fault sealing based on the construction of a deterministic juxtaposition and Shale gouge ratio analysis will not work in Abu Dhabi fields, as most of the section is mainly consisting of carbonates and the faulting history is mainly overcoming by strike-slip movement, where the vertical offset along the faults are minimum. Therefore, implementing a new approach based on construction of an integrated modeling using well logs, seismic, outcrop analogues, 1D MEM and 3D MEM, complemented with modeled and measured pressure data is necessary. 
The sealing behavior of faults is known to control aspects of hydrocarbon migration and reservoir distribution in space and time, the least understood factor in petroleum system. Fault planes can be sealing and prevent flow of fluids in one time and be leaking in another time. It can be sealing for oil and leaking for gas/oil or it can be sealing at one horizon and leaking at another horizon. This paper provides a workflow for assessing the risk of fault seal in undrilled prospects. This is an integrated approach based on statistical analysis of a database of sealing and non-sealing faults to solving fault seal issues, which involves a combination of: Detailed microstructural, geometries and petrophysical property analysis of fault rocks; fault zone poroperm histories, sealing mechanisms, sealing capacities, stability and the timing of fault activity during the burial history. In addition to the geomechanical modeling aspects with the characterization of fault array geometry, population, distribution of sub-seismic faults from wells, cores and outcrop data and an evaluation of the seismic scale fault array attributes. 
Faulting mechanisms in Abu Dhabi petroleum system have complicated movement histories involving numerous periods of reactivation and, in some cases multiple reversals of fault-movement direction. Therefore, to fully assess fault-seal potential it is necessary to examine the evolution of faults through time and the stress history, in addition to fault characterization, population, sealing criteria, and fault geometry/orientation. The results offer useful insights in the main factors and highlights how the faults behave, with risk evaluation, in terms of uncertainty ranges and sensitivities. As a result, the explorationist will have indication to remove the ""uncertain"" results.

Epoxy-pore casting is widely used to characterize geological samples.

The deployment of hydraulically powered coiled tubing (CT) tractors for matrix acidizing stimulations in extended reach carbonate reservoirs have provided critical benefits to well productivity. The technology allows for uniform placement of the matrix acid treatment while ensuring good zonal coverage. There have been several innovative tractor technologies developed over the last few years and the latest advances in design required an ‘out of the box' solution. For oil producers with electrical submersible pumps (ESP) completions including bypass sections, the 2.4"" restriction in tubing size requires a large expansion ratio once the tractor enters the 7"" cased and 6-1/8"" open hole sections. The slim size of the tractor and expansion ratio were the main challenges to overcome in designing a tractor capable of delivering a high enough pull force to reach deeper target depths. It was recognized that a radical change in slim tractor design was required if these goals were to be met. 
Although 2-1/8"" slim CT tractors have been used extensively in this field, the results were not always consistent, leading to reduced coverage during the acid stimulation of the well which resulted in lower production and reservoir optimization. These previous tractors relied upon wheel sections to transfer the pulling force to the casing or open hole. Although these tractors performed well in the cased hole environment, they were less effective once the wheels came in contact with the reservoir rock. To overcome this deficiency, a completely new approach was taken in designing a slim tractor that could deliver a much higher pull force with improved grip in the open hole section. The new design uses a synchronized gripper system to enable the tractor to have continuous traction in the open hole section. This new compact design, while less than <U+00BD> the length, produces almost double the pulling force of the previous wheel based slim CT tractors. 
During the trial test, the tractor delivered a pulling force of up to 3500 lbs to overcome friction and helical buckling forces to reach the target depth (TD). This resulted in an increase in the stimulation coverage from the original lock up depth of around 50% of the open hole, to increase the coverage to 100% of the open hole. 
This new design opens a window to ultimately meet the goals of improved well treatment in long horizontals resulting in better productivity and uniform flow distribution in extended reach oil wells. New generations of the tractor are planned for development with increased pull force, higher expansion ratios for larger OH sizes and also to allow real time production logging on coil tubing.|","Coil Tubing Deployed Tractors, New Design, Advances in Technology, Carbonate Reservoirs, Advances in Matrix Acidizing Stimulations"

This paper presents a seismic-attributes-guided method developed to assist drilling engineering both at design and execution stages. 
In recent years, shale gas has been a focus of development in the Sichuan basin (southwest China). The formations are over 400 million years old; they have been affected by multiple major tectonic events during geological times. As a result, of successive stress and strain, the reservoir rocks now display a large number of small-scale faults, folds and multi-directional fractures. To maximize the value from wells, while avoiding drilling hazards, a detailed structural delineation is required for: reservoir-scale geosteering, well trajectory control and drilling risk prevention and mitigation. 
Seismic is the only data available for 3D structural characterization. For an accurate result, high fidelity seismic (amplitude preserved high resolution data) is required. First a pre-stack data is selected (from gathers), conditioned and prepared as a micro cube for interpretation. Then a reservoir scale structural interpretation is carried out and a detailed structural map constructed, to analyze micro structural features from surface based attributes (amplitude, dip, curvature, etc.). In parallel multiple volume attributes are derived from the micro cube, including: variance, Ant-Tracking, apparent polarity and instantaneous bandwidth. In a final step surface attributes and volume attributes are integrated along with the planned well path to help anticipate possible drilling risk. ‘Ant-Tracking’ and ‘Seismic Discontinuity Planes’ algorithms were used to extract fault planes. The apparent polarity attribute reveals the sign of the reflection coefficient; it was found useful for delineating small events. Instantaneous bandwidth, represents the standard deviation of the instantaneous power spectrum about its mean, delineating vertical variation along the structural surface. 
We were able to predict drilling risk and formation dip with the integration of seismic attributes. 
The predictions were in good agreement with drilling events observed in the horizontal wells, such as: tight pull; mud loss; stuck pipe and drilling breaks. The predicted formation dip trend was confirmed. In one well, the original structural interpretation showed only one fault while the attributes analysis showed 11 faults. While drilling the well, for two of these faults, ""bit drops"" of 0.5m and 0.1m were observed. Only two predicted faults had no corresponding drilling event, but larger rock fragments were observed in cuttings, suggesting faulted zones may have been encountered. 
This paper is based on several real-time-tracked horizontal wells, drilled with the assistance of integrated seismic attribute analysis (including particularly apparent polarity and instantaneous bandwidth).|","Shale Gas, ant tracking, apparent polarity, seismic attribute, Geosteering"

Reservoir quality of carbonate rocks is usually controlled by the interplay of both the primary depositional and secondary diagenetic parameters. The assessment of the respective impact of these controls together with the understanding of the field-scale sedimentological organisation and diagenetic trends assist in the reconstruction of reservoir architecture and help production and appraisal programs. This work focuses on three formations recorded in the onshore Abu Dhabi area with the final aim of understanding their field-scale architecture through the study of six wells. Sediments reflect deposition in clay-prone and cleaner inner ramp to distal mid-ramp, where biotic assemblage is either dominated by Lithocodium/Bacinella (i.e. within lower Shuaiba and lowermost Lekhwair), rudists or peloids (i.e. within Kharaib). 
The sedimentological framework has been established through a detailed sedimentological description of c.2545ft of core and sequence stratigraphy interpretation. The occurrence of diagenetic processes (i.e. dissolution, cementation and fracturing/compaction) and their respective impact on pore system have been assessed through the observations of 804 thin-sections and the structural logging of c. 1936ft of core. The integration of the field-scale sedimentological organisation together with the distribution of the assessed reservoir quality controls and porosity/permeability data results in the establishment of the reservoir architectures of the three formations. 
In this area, the depositional fabric is characterised to be the primary parameter on the reservoir properties of the cored Thamama deposits with the exception of the lowermost cored Lekhwair and fractured reservoir: the best reservoir quality is found within inner ramp (locally dominated by Lithocodium/Bacinella) to backshoal grainstones and rudist-rich floatstones associated with a grainstone matrix. The reservoir quality decreases with the progressive increase in micrite matrix and clay content. The lowest porosity/permeability values are linked to the clay-rich inner ramp deposits recorded within the Dense Units, forming thick seals between the cleaner carbonate reservoir units. The localised occurrence of late dissolution phases has locally enhanced pore connectivity and preferentially affects the deposits which are initially characterised by good pore connectivity and volume (as observed in the lowermost Lekhwair and upper Kharaib Formations). Finally, cementation only locally decreases the reservoir properties and is broadly preferentially developed within and nearby clay-enriched deposits and at sharp lithological contacts often overprinted by stylolites. The focus of cementation on these surfaces results in one extensive ft-thick baffle within the Kharaib reservoir while a similar baffle is locally breached by rare 20cm-long fractures in Lower Shuaiba reservoir developed at the hinge of the anticline. Finally, the abundant and connected fracture network occurring within the lower Lowermost Lekhwair is likely to play a role on fluid flow in subsurface. 
The reservoir architecture will be integrated in the rock typing workflow to assist in the prediction of rock type vertical distribution and their lateral extent.|","Carbonate Reservoir, Abu Dhabi, Reservoir Architecture, Thamama"

The Khazzan development in the Sultanate of Oman operated by BP includes a multi-layered gas reservoir with stresses impacted by tectonic activity which has led to numerous challenges around multi-stage hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells within the field. These wells were primarily focused on cased-cemented horizontal sections through the reservoir but a decision was taken in 2014 to trial openhole multistage (OHMS) completion systems to understand their applicability in this field and the potential advantages such systems could bring with respect to the challenges seen in the cased-cemented systems. Two such systems have been run to date in the Khazzan development. Significant consideration has been given during the planning phase to follow a systematic process of implementation to deliver an effective learning curve with clear understanding of the impact of design and execution changes between wells. 
This paper will describe the details, including completion and fracturing design, fracturing execution and surveillance, and post-fracturing clean up and production, of the second OHMS well in the Khazzan development. The second well has built on the success of the initial trial and the well has been designed to demonstrate the repeatability and the reliability of this completion type in Khazzan. It was also tailored to further the understanding of some key unknown or uncertain elements of the fracturing treatments following the analysis and interpretation of the first OHMS completion. 
Specific focus areas that will be addressed in this paper include the use of a hydraulically activated toe fracturing sleeve, the effect of a reduction of mechanical packer spacing on fracture staging performance and efficiency, ball drop efficiency, and overall fracture execution efficiency improvements. 
A comparison of the system's performance across different reservoir quality will be examined, with the second system having been deliberately deployed in relatively low reservoir quality rock. The impact of various degrees of over-flush and under-flush on the individual fracture stage production performance will be reviewed. This is an important consideration for more conventional Middle East reservoirs and is often perceived to be a barrier to the implementation of the highly efficient systems currently deployed by North America.|","Fracturing"

Miqrat is a complex clastic deep tight gas reservoir in the North of the Sultanate of Oman. The Lower unit of the Miqrat formation is feldspatic sand characterized by low permeability not exceeding 0.1 mD and porosity up to 12 %. Based on results of the appraisal campaign of Field X, it contains significant volume of gas. However the production test data after fraccing showed mixed results. The objective of this study was to explain the production behavior and identify the sweetspot area for further development. 
Understanding the reason of possible overestimation of log derived Hydrocarbon saturation is important. Thus the interpretation of conventional and special logs was revisited. In parallel, all the available core data including SCAL and thin sections were scrutinized. Besides, the analysis of hydraulic fracture propagation, well tests, cement quality, PLT including Spectral Noise Log was performed. The wells were subdivided into categories according to their production results: –
wells producing no water –
wells with water channeling from the water leg of Middle Miqrat –
wells with transition zone intervals with 2 phase inflow of water and gas. |Based on the integrated analysis, extend of the gas and transition zones was established, and the location of future wells optimized. From the Spectral Noise log and Temperature data, water crossflow/channeling from Middle Miqrat was identified in 2 wells, either because of broken thin sealing shale above Lower Miqrat or due to poor cement quality. The sweetspot area with commercial production was mapped. Substantial gas volumes have been unlocked. Besides, an explanation of the uncertainty in log derived saturation was suggested. Core plugs and thin sections revealed presence of partially filled vugs, which is not a typical case in a clastic environment. The origin of this porosity is puzzling and likely due to dissolution of early diagenetic nodules. The rock with poorly connected vugs has high resistivity even if it is water bearing. The review of capillary pressure data revealed that the transition zone could exceed 100 m. This finding is consistent with the interpretation from well tests. 
The most practical implication of the current study potential of Lower Miqrat is unlocked. The integration of Open hole and cased hole logs and the additive information from Spectral Noise log for channeling/crossflow identification is shown. Presence of vuggy-like porosity in clastic sections and the impact of isolated vugs on log derived Saturation is demonstrated.|","vuggy porosity, tight gas, clastics, resistivity, Spectral noise log"

Seismic data offer valuable spatial information that contributes to the development strategy, such as drilling decisions and well planning. Inverting 3D seismic reflectivity data to impedance unlocks the potential of using seismic data to estimate the lateral variability and to predict reservoir geomechanical behaviour. The geomechanical model contributes for the evaluation of wellbore stability, frackability and drilling direction. The objective of this work is to illustrate the use of seismic derived models for reservoir and geomechanical properties, such as total porosity, total organic carbon (TOC) and rock rigidity. These properties are instrumental to characterize tight reservoirs and useful tools for defining a horizontal well trajectory. 
The study area has an exploration potential of unconventional reservoirs, targeting tight carbonates from Upper Jurassic. To date, only one well has been drilled in the area of the interest and high quality 3D seismic data is available. The process consists of conducting seismic inversion, using the well and the 3D PSTM seismic data, and resulting in the generation of 3D subsurface impedance model. The well-log relationships between impedance and reservoir quality (effective porosity, source richness) and completion quality (brittleness) were determined and showed high correlation. Hence, 3D rock quality and geomechanical volumes were derived to characterize the behaviour of the reservoir target. 
Seismic derived properties models yield a better description of the reservoir heterogeneity than using seismic reflectivity data only. The horizontal well trajectory was planned taking into account the observed and significant lateral variability revealed by the 3D models estimated based on seismic inverted data. 
The results obtained using this methodology demonstrate the importance of integrating geophysical characterisation as a relevant supporting factor in the drilling decision making process. In particular, it validates the use of seismic derived reservoir and completion quality models as an additional tool in the definition of a horizontal well trajectory in a tight/unconventional deep gas target.|","Unconventional Reservoir, Reservoir Characterization, Well Planning"

The natural gas industry is increasingly pursuing compact and lower weight processing technology to meet the technological and economic demands of offshore, onshore, remote, and challenged gas processing. This paper describes ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company's (EMURC) new inline dehydration and separation technology meant to replace conventional TEG tower and associated separator vessels to meet pipeline dew point specifications. Compact Mass transfer and Inline Separation Technology (cMIST™) achieves this goal with significant reductions in weight, footprint and cost. 
The results of a field demonstration completed in February 2016 are discussed to establish the effectiveness and advantages of this novel technology. The technology was demonstrated using a skid-mounted unit in the Woodford trend area of Oklahoma, USA at an XTO Energy production facility. cMIST™ was tested under a range of field conditions (temperature, gas and solvent flow rates, process configurations, transient and upset) to examine the dehydration capacity, operability, and reliability. 
cMIST™ relies on state-of-the-art technological advances in contacting and inline separation to achieve pipeline specification dry gas. The technology is highly modular to allow for simple transportation into remote, challenged, or offshore environments and provide installation configuration flexibility. Case studies show a 50 % weight reduction of the absorption equipment in selected applications.

The development of Lower Cretaceous reservoirs in a mature field located 84 km southwest of Abu Dhabi required a series of stress measurements across the reservoirs to tectonically calibrate the 3D Geomechanical model. The stress measurements were acquired by multiple straddle packer microfrac tests conducted through pipe-conveyance in a slim openhole wellbore. Various pore pressure depletion conditions across the reservoirs make the deployment of straddle packer tools in slimholes a very challenging operation. 
Five in-situ stress measurements are acquired in this study from the proper identification of fracture closure pressure after reaching the formation breakdown pressure. Each microfrac test consists of three pressurization cycles and three pressure decline (fall-off) periods after fracture propagation. The fracture closure identification is achieved using three different pressure decline analysis methods on each fall-off test: (i) square-root of time, (ii) G-function and (iii) Log-Log plot. The final fracture closure measurement is obtained after consolidating the three fracture closure identification results in all three injection cycles conducted on each microfrac station. 
The Microfrac tests conducted in the vertical pilot borehole provide precise in-situ measurements of formation breakdown, fracture reopening, propagation and closure at multiple reservoir layers. These in-situ measurements provide an accurate present-day stress profile across the reservoirs for constructing a proper 3D geomechanical model of the field. These microfrac tests measure minimum horizontal stress gradients of approximately 0.66 to 0.76 psi/ft, confirming the normal faulting stress regime in these reservoirs. The tectonic stress calibration is obtained by adjusting the value of tectonic strains across the reservoirs until the log-derived minimum horizontal stress matches the fracture closure pressure from the microfrac tests. 
These in-situ stress measurements provide the subsurface information required to fully calibrate the tectonic stress acting on the reservoirs. This tectonic stress calibration is needed to create a representative 3D geomechanical subsurface model to predict accurate subsurface responses to stress and fluid flow over the field development. Additionally, conducting microfrac tests in slimholes provides multiple acquisition benefits: the straddle packer tool tolerates higher differential pressure across the elements than in large borehole, achieving higher absolute bottom hole pressure to induce formation breakdown; the borehole induced stress zone is radially smaller compared to larger hole sizes; the induced fracture does not required excessive propagation away from the borehole in order to capture the far-field in-situ closure stress.|","Straddle Packer, Microfrac, Stress, Geomechanics, Tectonics"

The proper fracture stimulation of high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) carbonate formations completed with horizontal wellbores is a challenging task for any operator or service company, particularly because of concerns associated with HP/HT, acid reactivity, completion and production equipment corrosion, and acid distribution. The case history presented in this paper describes the performance of an acid fracture intervention in a HP/HT well where, because of a number of problems encountered during the well construction stage, this intervention was the last procedure considered to evaluate the productivity of a Marrat formation well. 
In view of the stimulation challenges encountered, the architecture of the wellbore, and the intervention stimulation requirement to evaluate the productivity of the horizontal well completed in the Marrat formation, it was necessary to change the proppant fracture stimulation technique originally planned. Instead, it was decided that a selective acid fracture stimulation would be performed in the prospective part of the horizontal section where three long perforation clusters had been placed. Acidizing fracture stimulation was performed in one intervention using a next-generation liquid and soluble solid diversion system that enabled the generation of one selective fracture per perforation cluster. 
The planned acidizing fracture stimulation process was implemented properly in the field in accordance with the design constraints. The reactive fluid system diversion and the generation of a new fracture when the diversion system reached the perforation were clearly observed. The post-acid fractured well productivity index (PI) showed the high quality of the stimulation performed in a challenging environment, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new diversion system for creating selective fractures in a horizontal wellbore with multiple perforation clusters. 
Considering the well's architecture, HP/HT nature, and single intervention requirement, the case study documented in the paper can be helpful in the decision-making process when selecting a proper stimulation technique for challenging conditions. The effectiveness of the new diversion systems is also discussed.|","recovery, stimulation, HPHT, case history, one intervention"

Amid suppressed oil prices, the Oman Ministry of Oil and Gas continues to invest in this country’s energy industry. Fortunately, upstream companies in Oman have the capabilities to help the ministry increase the country's output. Continued exploration and appraisal success allowed a private operator to rapidly increase production in the Shahad oil field. A key to this success in early production was reduction in drilling time – faster well delivery. 
The operator's slimhole 6<U+215B>-in. and 5<U+215E>-in. sections are challenging directional build and lateral application drilling through dolomite and limestone. Polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits were tested, but they did not show durability in distances drilled. The PDC bits used in this application experienced wear damage on the cutting structure that reduced bit efficiency to drill the longer distances and finish the section. Instead, the operator chose to deploy impregnated drill bits on turbine to drill longer distances and reduce tripping time. The next step was to drill faster. The operator partnered with a service company to develop and trial a new impregnated drill bit technology for improved drilling rates of penetration (ROP). 
The service company uses an innovative process within a certified drilling optimization group that enables a structured approach for understanding the complete drilling environment. This successful process, founded on the continuous improvement cycle—plan, execute, analyze, and capture—delivers practices and technology recommendations to realize performance gains and significant well-time reduction. Areas of focus include proper hydraulics for cooling the cutting structure, accurate match of impregnated diamond materials to achieve improved penetration rates, and the correct gauge configuration to avoid bit sticking within the borehole. Using this process, two new impregnated drill bit designs were specially developed to drill the dolomite and limestone formation. The new technology was established to drill a lateral section with a turbine as the driving system in a carbonate formation with unconfined compressive strengths of 35k to 45k pounds per square inch. 
The first trial of the 5<U+215E>-in. impregnated drill bit matched the best field performance metrics of distance drilled and ROP. The second iteration continued to improve performance, delivering a 23% increase in ROP. The authors will present case studies to demonstrate how the latest technology impregnated drill bits contributed to faster well delivery for this operator's drilling program in Oman.|","impreg, dolomite, Oman, drill bit, turbine"

With the increase of Egypt's domestic demand for energy, economical production from unconventional reservoirs is a great challenge to maintain production's annual decline. This has spurred interest in the development of unconventional resources, such as tight reservoirs and shale gas, particularly because of the enormous success in North America that brought unconventional resources to the forefront of the discussion on the future of energy. The country has launched studies to evaluate, explore and appraise several prospects for unconventional gas in Shoushan-Matrouh and Abu Gharadig basins. Exploratory pilot data wells were drilled and completed in the appraisal program for collecting the required data to evaluate the reservoirs qualities, demonstrate the availability of reserves, and identify optimal technology to maximize productivity and set the foundation for future development of these unconventional plays. Logs, core testing, and analysis service data were performed on or collected from these wells. Laboratory testing was conducted to understand the complex mineralogy and variable rock fabric. Geomechanical rock properties derived from advanced petrophysical analysis of newly acquired high-definition triple-combo full-wave sonic logs and core samples were combined to develop sophisticated models. These understandings helped reduce uncertainty and the lessons learned from this work and presented in this paper helped define completion and stimulation technologies for horizontal wells. 
This objective of this paper is to review of the results and share lessons learned related to the recent appraising activities of unconventional plays in Egypt's western desert, evaluate these unconventional resources to unlock their potential. In addition, this paper present the challenges of development, highlight the best strategies required for field development to capitalize on the promising potential of these reservoirs through an integrated advanced workflow. The results from this study will shed light on the results of recent unconventional gas exploration and appraisal activities, which indicate that the western desert of Egypt holds substantial resources of unconventional gas.

The application of horizontal well drilling coupled with the multistage fracturing technology enables commercial development of shale gas formations. To optimize the shale gas development, the transient gas flow in a shale formation is of great research interest. Due to anano-scale pore radius, the gas flow in shale matrix may fall in flow regimes which include viscous flow, slip flow and Knudsen diffusion. On top of that, gas adsorption/desorption and stress-sensitivity are some other important phenomena in shales. In this paper, we introduce a novel numerical simulation scheme to depict the above phenomena and predict the gas production from a multi-stage fractured horizontal well, which is crucial for the shale gas development. 
Instead of Darcy's equation, we implement the apparent permeability in the continuity equation to depict the gas flow (viscous flow, slip flow and Knudsen diffusion) in shale matrix. An adsorption/desorption term is included in the continuity equation as an accumulation term. A sink which is based on Peaceman's well model is placed at the center of the fracture cell. Uniform fluid flow from matrix to fractures is assumed. Only viscous flow is considered in the fractures and the permeability of the fractures doesnot change with pressure. The model is validated via comparing with an infinity-conductivity fracture model. Moreover, the lab data of Eagle Ford shale which provides the relationship between matrix permeability and the effective stress is integrated into the two-way coupling geomechanical process to simulate a stress-sensitive shale formation. Furthermore, the Langmuir and BET models will be compared to investigate the detailed adsorption/desorption process. 
This methodology examines the influence of each mechanism for the transient shale gas flow. Instead of conventional pressure-independent Darcy permeability, the apparent permeability increases with the development of a shale gas reservoir, which leads to higher productivity. With the gas adsorption/desorption, the reservoir pressure is maintained via the supply of released gas from nano-scale pore wall surfaces, which also leads to higher gas production. In addition, it yields a 5% difference for the cumulative production for one yearbetween the Langmuir and BET models. With the consideration of geomechanics, the apparent permeability is decreased due to the compaction of nano-scale pores, which leads to a decrease in productivity. Due to the difference of compaction magnitude for each grid block, geomechanics creates additional heterogeneity for anano-pore network in a shale formation, which we should pay more attention to. 
A novel methodology is introduced to examine the crucial phenomena in a shale formation, which simultaneously takes into account the influence of flow regimes, gas adsorption/desorption and stresssensitivity. On top of that, the productivity of a multi-stage fractured horizontal well is quantified. We provide an effective way to quantify the above effects for the transient gas flow in shale formations.|","integrated methodology, two-way coupling geomechanics, apparent permeability, productivity of multi-fractured horizontal well, Peacemanaˆ™s well model"

P., Technische Universitat Braunschweig| Reckmann, H., Baker Hughes, a GE company","|Abstract 
Mechanical loads in hole-opening BHAs result in tool failures and generate maintenance costs and non-productive time. This paper presents a method to increase the reliability of hole-opening BHAs by optimally matching the bit and reamer. The weight and torque distribution between the bit and reamer is predicted using a stationary load model. New quality load curves facilitate the evaluation of bit-reamer combinations in a user-friendly way. The model and the load curves are validated on a unique set of field data, enabling determination of the model's accuracy. 
The model is based on the mechanical specific energies at the bit and at the reamer. The model assumes the RPM and rate of penetration to be constant, the BHA is rigid in the axial and torsional directions and the lateral movement is blocked. Quality load curves are deduced that depict the load distribution in one plot. The model is validated on a unique data set that includes several high-precision measuring tools placed along the drill string. The unconfined compressive strength over depth that usually is not measured in other runs is available. The data set enables precise determination of the axial forces and torques directly at the bit and at the reamer. The observed mechanical specific energy, drilling efficiency, and aggressiveness of both cutting tools over depth are measured. 
The model and the quality curves are used to predict the weight and torque distribution depending on the formation type at the bit and at the reamer. A comparison of the prediction to the measured data shows that the weight distribution is predicted with an error of 2% and the torque distribution is predicted with an error of 10.8%. The model accuracy is determined by introducing uncertain parameters into the model. The load predictions are again compared to the measured data. Using the coarse parameter set, the mean prediction error increases to 13%, which is very good, considering the simplifying assumptions of the model. 
The validated model and the new quality curves enable an optimal choice of bit and reamers. The presented approach is fast and user-friendly and perfect for an application in advisory software in the well-planning phase. The increased reliability due to less mechanical overloads leads to reduced maintenance costs and less non-productive time of the reamer BHAs.|","Reliability, Mechanics, Modeling, Matching, Bit, Reamer, Hole-Opening, Load, Prediction, Advisory, Automation"

UAE which has traditionally been an oil producing country is reassessing the nation's energy production strategy and are appraising alternate energy sources. A part of this strategy includes exploring and assessing the potential of their unconventional and tight gas reservoirs. In order produce gas at economic rates from these deep unconventional reservoirs hydraulic fracturing is a vital technology to unlock the reservoir potential and enable hydrocarbon flow to surface. 
The first onshore hydraulic fracturing treatment in UAE was a challenging operation since the target formation was never successfully fractured previously. The expected breakdown pressure, insitu stresses and pore pressure regimes were unknown. A robust workflow was put into place using global and regional experience. An integrated formation evaluation was conducted during drilling and logging the vertical wellbore in order to select target zones and perforating intervals. Triaxial testing and ultrasonic measurements were conducted on core samples from the treatment well to calibrate the Geomechanical model before the hydraulic fracture treatment execution. Detailed lab testing was carried out to assist fracturing fluid and proppant selection. Multiple hydraulic fracturing simulations were conducted to define the final stimulation treatment program. 
Evaluation of the target UAE unconventional gas reservoir during the drilling and evaluation phase indicated the formation possessed high static stiffness, highly laminated depositional environment, significant overpressure and high insitu horizontal stresses. These formation characteristics posed some challenges during the hydraulic fracturing design and execution. High fracturing treatment pressures and propellant based perforation charges were required to effectively breakdown the formation in order to place the proppant into the fracture during execution. The stimulated target zone showed good initial gas production post treatment execution, which met the primary objective of proving recoverable gas in place. 
The hydraulic fracturing lessons learned from this first onshore unconventional well will be applied to future exploration and appraisal wells to ensure stimulation success and hydrocarbon deliverability. Unlocking the large quantity of gas from these organic rich carbonate reservoirs will play a significant role in UAE hydrocarbon production strategy.|","Tight Gas, High Pressure, First Fracturing Treatment, High Temperature, UAE"

Hydrocarbon migration pathways control the distribution of oil and gas in Abu Dhabi sedimentary basins and therefore it is one of the most important and controversial problems in petroleum system pillars. The complexity of this problem appears in full of regards to the faults and fractures, as most of them are cemented, while the bedding planes forming corridors that are playing an important role in turn. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the direction, dominant form, and distance of oil migration. The role of bedding corridors in migration of hydrocarbon was not fully estimated. This paper introduces the bedding corridors as an important migration pathway in Abu Dhabi. They are sub-horizontal tabular bodies of bedding plane weak zones formed as shear swarms, which vertically divide the entire reservoir thickness and extend laterally as their layers. Bedding corridors are genetically related to shearing along the bedding surfaces and they contribute to the conductive systems in Abu Dhabi reservoirs. 
Bedding corridors can be best identified from horizontal borehole image logs, and as spikes in open-hole logs. An integrated study comprising logs, cores and outcrops are the main sources to delineate them. The significance of this approach is that once a diagnostic signature can be recognized in open-hole logs, in combination with lost circulation data, it can be used to allocate bedding corridors in other vertical wells with no image logs. 
Results indicate that the horizontal stress anisotropy is the key parameter to predict bedding corridors behavior under different stress regimes, as the Shmin and SHmax is usually very close to each other in most of Abu Dhabi reservoirs. Swapping stresses with depth is common in Abu Dhabi fields, where a strike-slip regime can open and dilate the shear stress along the bedding planes. Strike slip faulting regime, wich prevailed Abu Dhabi reservoirs is the main source of the stresses that distribute along the bedding planes, where most of the stresses are dissipating horizontally comprising the strike slip component. Bedding corridors can be considered as indicators of the reservoir stress history, where they form extraordinary clusters of a huge number of shear conductive corridors in a transpressional regime. In Abu Dhabi oil and gas reservoirs, bedding corridors networks help drain hydrocarbons. In carbonate formations, for example, it is quite common to observe a permeability contrast of about 500mD or more between the rock matrix and surrounding bedding corridors. In this paper, we differentiate between image-log porosity and density-neutron porosity, which is regarded as secondary porosity attributable to bedding corridors. We also introduce here a working hypothesis about their effect on hydrofraccing being part of geomechanical assessment. Geomechanically, these corridors can be used efficiently to increase production particularly in tight and unconventional reservoirs. The role of bedding corridors is particularly important in reservoirs having a tight matrix. It is recommended horizontal drilling to maximize production through those bedding corridors compared to vertical wells. Even in fraccing design, there is a need to highlight the importance of bedding planes in helping fracs to propagate.|","Bedding Planes, Shmin/SHmax ratio, Migration Pathways, Shear Swarms, Tight and unconventional reservoirs"

Ground settlement in PLANT areas are major concern as it might affect integrity of structures and safe operations. In a recent incident at GASCO Sulphur Handling Terminal (Ruwais), substantial ground settlements were observed at sulphur granulator unit area which affected nearby foundations/structures. Various reasons can contribute to settlement issue and this paper presents the methods employed to determine the root causes, assessing the impact on existing structures/foundations and identifying corrective actions required to ensure safe operation. 
A detailed study was carried out to ascertain the extent of settlement and to identify the reasons. In order to assess the severity of settlement and its pattern, topographical survey was performed. Geotechnical investigations including boreholes, trail pits with associated field & laboratory tests were executed to study the ground conditions, soil chemistry, collapse potential and strength characteristics of ground. Equipment vendor were also consulted during various stages of study to discuss allowable operational limits. Study results revealed the root cause of ground settlement and appropriate remedial methods were finalized considering techno-economic factors. 
Topography results determined the affected foundations/structures and settlement extent. Geotechnical investigation findings indicated that the settled area is a reclaimed land consists of dredged hydraulic fill. The fill material was poorly compacted calcareous soil, contains high proportion of carbonates & gypsum. Carbonate sand is susceptible to dissolve in presence of acidic water & has collapse potential properties. Leaky chemical drain channels were noticed at affected locations. 
Many possible causes of settlement were analyzed and evaluated based on investigation results. It is concluded that principal root cause of the settlement is leakage of acidic/non-acidic water from drain channels into ground which had weakened and consolidated the calcareous soil. 
Static and dynamic analysis were performed for settled foundations/structures to ensure its stability under various potential loading conditions. Necessary modifications and repair work details are finalized based on analysis results. To avoid further settlement, various options for ground improvement are studied including compaction grouting, underpinning of foundations, jacking/relevelling of super structure, compensation grouting & replacement of foundations. 
Study outcome showed that ‘compaction grouting’ is most suitable & economic long term solution. This method involves drilling and injection of vertical and inclined holes in the ground at affected areas with high pressure grouting and thus displace & compact the soil to prevent settlement.|","sinking ground, sunken ground, foundation settlement, compaction grouting, Ground Settlement"

A giant lean gas reservoir overlying a large oil rim is producing for more than 27 years became under depletion mode without any pressure maintenance. Formation collapse in reservoirs under depletion can cause permeability reduction, completion damage and well failure, reducing or even interrupting production and affecting the ultimate recovery from the reservoir. It is therefore critical to predict any risk in formation collapse. If such risks exist, recommendations are required to optimize reservoir management. 
Stress measurements were acquired and core analysis were performed in intact rocks area and used for 1D MEM (Mechanical Earth Model) and 3D MEM. 1D MEMs for 10 wells were constructed. Rock mechanical tests were conducted on core samples. 3D MEM was created with 13 interpreted seismic overburden horizons and 105 seismic faults. Four scenarios were performed to identify formation failure during the scheduled production. The worst-case scenario will happen of reservoir depletion, in case of weak formation and reactivated faults. 
Intensive logging, fracture modelling, coring program across the main fault corridor and RMT (Rock Mechanics Tests) were performed in vertical and horizontal holes across the fault corridor area to fulfil gaps of rock mechanical properties (elastic properties and rock strength) and field stresses. The acquired data were seeds for Lab testing, fracture network analysis and fault characterization which used to update the 3D MEM. 
Additional Lab tests to fill gaps in rock samples with high porosity (> 30%) were carried out and 1D MEM of 5 more wells were constructed, and the 3D MEM were updated. 
The 2017 updated 3D MEM eliminates three of the 2013 four scenarios and ended up with one robust scenario that shows better reservoir integrity and very small localized areas of pore collapse in high porosity regions only (> 30%) compare to the previous model. The reservoir can produce under depletion mode with production optimization in areas of expected compaction.

A., Schlumberger| Peralta, J. D., Schlumberger| Al Zeidi, O., Schlumberger","|Abstract 
Interpretation of logs from an exploration pilot well and a lateral drilled from the pilot in the Late Cretaceous Natih formation in the Sultanate of Oman was used for designing a multistage hydraulic fracturing treatment. A high-tier logging suite including borehole image, advanced dipole sonic, geochemical, and triple combo data was acquired in both wellbores. The objective of the pilot hole was to select the best landing point in terms of reservoir quality (RQ) and completion quality (CQ) so that a horizontal well could be drilled and multistage stimulations performed in the organic-rich Natih B source rock. 
In contrast to much of North America, significant tectonic forces are frequently present in this region. The geomechanical setting might thus strongly affect hydraulic fracture initiation, propagation and proppant placement. It therefore plays an important role in lateral landing point selection. Borehole images, integrated with petrophysical and geomechanical log properties, were used to identify the optimum landing zone. Breakouts as well as longitudinal and transverse drilling-induced fractures were identified on the pilot borehole images over the Natih Formation, indicating a large horizontal stress anisotropy and a compressional tectonic setting. An interval from which vertical hydraulic fractures would initiate at low initiation pressure and grow vertically to contact intervals with good RQ was selected as the target lateral landing point. Image and dipole sonic data were acquired in the horizontal well, and both longitudinal and transverse induced fractures were identified. Those data were used to selectively place hydraulic fracturing stages. Diagnostic injection tests on each stimulation treatment confirmed low fracture initiation pressures and the creation of vertical hydraulic fractures, thus validating the selection of both the landing point and the location of the hydraulic fracture initiation points. All treatments were successfully placed to completion. 
This paper demonstrates that a workflow based on the combination of image and dipole sonic logs in both a pilot well and a lateral drilled from the pilot enables the creation of vertical hydraulic fractures at moderately low initiation pressures and successful placement of stimulation treatments in the lateral. This technique shows promise for effective hydraulic fracturing in regions where significant tectonic forces are present.|","Borehole Images, Engineered completion, Geomechanics, RQ and CQ, Compressive Tectonic Setting"

Drillstring vibrations namely axial, lateral and torsional vibrations are the primary reason for downhole tool failure and reduction in rate of penetration (ROP). Factors like bit design, bottom hole assembly, bit-rock interaction, rotational speed, wellbore hydraulics, weight on bit (WOB) and drillstring-borehole interaction affect vibrations, out of which only rotational speed and WOB can be changed in real-time to minimize vibrations. It has been a topic of interest to understand and model downhole vibrations, minimize them and find an optimum range of drilling parameters to increase the drilling efficiency. 
This article presents the results of experimental studies conducted on a fully automated drilling rig to examine the effects of drilling parameters on drillstring vibrations, torque and rate of penetration. The study is different in terms of the high-speed range and the use of axial vibration transmitter to measure the vibration severity as per ISO standards. Experiments were performed on two different rock samples with varying strength. Perfect hole cleaning with negligible fluid flow effect was assumed. Each experiment was run for an average of six minutes collecting an average of 120 data points which were then averaged out for analysis. Parametric study was carried out to analyze the impacts of bit strength to rock strength ratio, bit constant and intrinsic specific energy on torque using existing model. As the drillstring was stiff and small, torsional oscillations were not observed and only lateral and axial vibrations were studied. Effect of drilling parameters and vibration on ROP was studied only on soft rock sample as ROP on hard rock was too small to be recorded 
Once the input parameters for the analytic model were methodically selected they show good agreement with the experimental data. The results of the parametric study revealed that estimation of torque relies heavily on the bit constant. Axial vibrations increased when rotational speed was near to the natural frequency of the drillstring which resulted in increase of ROP. Type of formation affected the magnitude of lateral and axial vibrations. Reducing both rotational speed and WOB helps to minimize lateral vibrations in hard formations while reducing rotational speed can effectively reduce axial vibrations.|","Drillbotics, axial vibrations, automated rig, vibrations, lateral vibrations"

This objective of this work is to improve well perforation by using non-damagingsafe (non-explosive) high power laser perforation technology. For several years of research, high power lasers have been proven in the lab to create controllable perforation tunnels with enhanced flow properties. This paper presents the strategy of lab to field transformations to perforate horizontal well with two inches in diameter by twenty four inches deep at 10,000 feet in horizontal well. 
High power laser is an alternative and innovative technology to currently used shaped chargeperforation. Lasers are advanced in several industries for their several unique properties such as power, precision, control and reliability, with these properties; controllable non-damaged enhanced oriented perforated tunnels are achieved. Laser power can be adjusted precisely to control the depth of the tunnel; the tool can be oriented to create perforation in any direction regardless of the reservoir stress orientations as lasers are stress independent. 
Shale, Sandstones (including tight sandstones) and carbonate rocks have been perforated at different conditions, the result from all rock types showed improvement in permeability and creation of controlled geometry without any compactions or damage. The success of the lab experiments lead to field deployment strategy to create the first in the industry laser perforation at 10,000 feet. Lab to field transformation is presented at different stages, first prove of concept, then design and test lab prototype tool, followed by improved field upscale downhole tool.

More and more cement compositions used for oil and gas wells, such as resilient cement with post expansion additives, are designed to obtain elastic and strength properties as well as pre-stresses in the cement sheath that allow the cement sheath to resist tensile or shear stresses induced by pressure and thermal loads emanating from the well during its full life cycle. 
The computation of stress changes induced by well loads once the cement is hardened is straightforward. Those stresses will depend on geometrical parameters such as casing and hole sizes on one side and on elastic properties of casing, cement and formation on the other side. The difficulty stems from the need to compute the pre-stress in the cement sheath which is the result of complex hydraulic, chemical, thermal and mechanical interactions during hydration. Another difficulty is to measure the evolution of relevant hydro-thermo-mechanical (HTM) parameters that affect the transition from hydrostatic pressure after placement to stress with shear components after hardening. 
In the recent years, Total has developed both modeling and laboratory capabilities that allow to characterize the HTM behavior of cement under in-situ pressure and temperature conditions and to use the measured parameters to analyze the mechanical integrity of cement sheath from placement on. Those tools are now routinely used to determine the best suited ranges of mechanical properties on one side and to QC and adjust cement systems proposed by service companies. This approach allowed achieving successful cementation of wells in harsh environment such as HP-HT wells. 
The development of the software and laboratory facilities with internal resources proved beneficial from many perspectives. A great advantage is to be able to know how the various parameters associated with different cement compositions are affecting the cement integrity under specific down hole conditions. More importantly, it allows Total as an operating company to perform sound validation through confrontation to real field cases. 
The aim of this paper is to present the fundamental concepts used in the Total's proprietary cement integrity model called T-CemInt and to describe the associated parameters and the ways of measuring them in the laboratory. Also, the paper will show a real case study that included lab tests, modeling and post cement sheath assessment with standard logging tools.|","integrity, laboratory, modelling, Cement"

Conventional oil from the prolific carbonate reservoirs of Abu Dhabi has been produced over half a century from different anticlinal structures. Now, the time is right to go back to where it all started- the source rock in the depths of the syncline. The first well in the syncline provided an opportunity to characterize the reservoir quality of Cretaceous Shilaif Formation and understand the potential of the unconventional source rock oil play in Abu Dhabi.   Methods 
The carbonate source rocks of Abu Dhabi are very different from the unconventional source rocks in the rest of the world and require a unique approach. An integrated workflow combining log, core and surface measurements has been carried out to characterize the Shilaif formation in the syncline in the south-western part of Abu Dhabi. Every measurement has a distinctive value and helps reduce uncertainties about Reservoir Quality. A critical examination of different available technologies was carried out to examine and optimize the characterization program to understand and reduce all uncertainties about reservoir quality.   Results 
The Shilaif source rock in this syncline to the south west of Abu Dhabi is a carbonate-rich organic mudstone, which distinguishes itself by lack of clay and vertical heterogeneity. It is a hybrid source rock with simultaneous presence of both organic and inorganic pores. The extensive core analysis program provided insights about porosity, permeability and saturation, which were used to validate the log interpretation. Higher thermal maturity and stronger compaction lead to different reservoir qualities than the ones previously recognized on the nearby shallower anticlinal structures. The reservoir quality of Shilaif in the syncline (levels of oil saturation, producible pore-sizes and permeability) exceed the pay criteria known to be required to produce economic volumes of oil in other basins around the world. Geomechanical characterization shows that the rock is extremely compact and requires careful planning with respect to proper completions and appropriate fracturing strategy for this play to be successful   Novel Information 
This is the first well in the syncline, targeting the mature source rock of Shilaif, based on previously existing literature. This paper explains the interpretation methodology workflow, that integrates all the measurements and discuss for the first time about viability of Shilaif as an economic source rock oil play in UAE, focusing on the syncline.|","Integration of measurements at different scales, First well in syncline, Unconventional Oil, Geomechanics"

This paper presents the modern and fit for purpose methodologies, challenges with mitigation, special consideration from geological, drilling and completions to successfully deliver first deep horizontal well with lateral length of ~1300 m and open hole multistage fracking in tight carbonate reservoir in Lower Indus Basin of Pakistan. The paper also discusses economic feasibility of making re-entries into suspended vertical wells in generally high cost services infrastructure in Pakistan. The methodologies include special deliberations on; scenario based Geomechanics Modelling, Wellbore Placement Optimization along with economic analysis by using Re-Entry versus New Well, Formation Behaviors, Drill String Design, Drill Bits Design, Hydraulics and Torque and Drag (T&D) modelling with friction factor calibration, Drilling Fluid and Strategies, Downhole Problems & Mitigations, Wellbore Quality for Open hole Multistage Fracking – All challenges, associated risks are discussed and mitigated in detail. 
There were two main challenges in the wellbore placement; first is the requirement of wellbore to intersect maximum critically stressed fractures that required a new wellbore to drill and intersect but the economics of new wellbore was not feasible. Drilling team optimized the placement of the well and utilized an existing suspended wellbore to align well trajectory without compromising multistage fracking requirements. This had significantly reduced well cost and enabled the operator to proceed further. The second challenge was the wellbore failure that might have compromised hole quality and multistage open hole fracking on which the project economics based heavily. Two different fault regimes were present around the well that made the placement of wellbore more challenging. Wellbore trajectory was refined with multiple sensitivities of Geomechanics to fit the safe mud weight window. The LWD suits were run to enable the Geosteering in to sweet fractured zones. T&D model was developed and calibrated at real-time to take decisions. The drilling fluid was designed with special additives to encompass high temperature and stress caging of formation to prevent wellbore failure as well as to reduce Torque and Drag. Bit designs are also revamped that successfully drilled high UCS formations with minimal thermal cracking & favoring the RSS system to achieve landing the full lateral within top 30 m of formation. All aspects were thoroughly addressed and mitigated successfully resulting in to successful deliverables of the well project within the stipulated time and cost.

Gathering of wireline data in Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) wells is still not a standard process, complicated even more by inclination and step out. This paper presents a case study of recording logs conveyed using an open hole tractor in a highly deviated section. The challenge was made more difficult because Water Based Mud (WBM) was required to allow the full suite of planned logs. The operation time that can be saved is up to four days. 
The 8.5 in. pilot hole was designed based on the target and the sidetrack points for the mother hole. The inclination of the pilot hole was 63° and the wireline accessibility simulation based on offset friction factor showed that the open hole was not 100% accessible with Wireline Conveyed Logging (WCL) string. Therefore, an open hole tractor was selected to reach the required point. To minimize the risks for the logging operation, a six blade Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bit, Rotary Steerable System (RSS) and Logging While Drilling (LWD) were used in the pilot hole to make a smooth trajectory and confirm wellbore conditions. 
The logging operations were conducted smoothly and safely. It was observed that the actual results matched very well simulations, and the open hole tractor was required to convey the tools to the Total Depth (TD). The total tractoring length was 16,000 ft over the four runs, and there were no issues observed during the tractoring which confirms that the steps taken while drilling the section were correct and approximately four days of operation were saved by means of the open hole tractor as compared to Pipe-Conveyed Logging (PCL) operation. In addition, the mother hole length also was minimized to get proper sidetrack point from the optimized pilot hole trajectory and the potential total saving time would be more than seven days. 
This paper also describes the optimization of well trajectories for pilot hole and mother hole and the gap related to planning from drilling and logging points of view, with aim to ensure 100% data gathering. The use of an open hole tractor for long interval in highly deviated well is the first time in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and WBM conditions are non-standard operations which require significant amount of preparation during execution.|","Wireline, Logging, Extended-Reach Drilling, Open Hole Tractor, Data Gathering"

During drilling, openhole logs provide valuable data to identify the location of hydrocarbon resources, characterize the host formation, and quantify the asset in terms of size and producibility. Such data acquisition during field appraisal plays a critical part in the preparation of the field development plan. However, openhole logs may not be available or may not be possible due to various constraints. In some cases, data that is essential for petrophysical evaluation has been overlooked during the planning of the openhole log acquisition. In other cases, wellbore conditions while drilling may preclude openhole logging in favor of securing the well. This latter scenario can often occur in appraisal wells when knowledge of the pressure regimes in the different formations in the field is still incomplete. 
Several logging services are available for acquiring formation information through casing. This capability can provide an excellent option to acquire the necessary formation evaluation data through casing, thereby completing the input to the decision-making process. 
We present three separate examples in which casedhole formation evaluation was used to augment data acquired in the open hole for an improved formation evaluation. The applications range from providing reliable density and sonic data for seismic tie-in to providing more accurate estimates of porosity and saturation for selection of test intervals or for input to the static geological model. The examples demonstrate the use of various through-casing formation evaluation technologies including density, neutron, resistivity, acoustic compressional and shear slowness, and pulsed neutron capture and inelastic spectroscopy logs. We show that through a judicious combination of logs the primary evaluation objectives can be fulfilled. 
We discuss the challenges in data acquisition, the steps for quality assessment of the data acquired through casing, and interpretation procedures to integrate all the data in an answer product. The substantial benefit of such an option to the operator is also discussed.|","Casedhole Logging, Neutron Spectroscopy, versus, Openhole Logging"

Reliable of pore scale and reservoir modeling in reservoir with water alternating gas (WAG) flooding is challenging and important for getting an accurate reservoir characterization, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and reservoir management.

I have used an integrated pore scale and reservoir models workflow: establish pore network model, validate with SCAL, up scale to well logs, utilize formation pressure/sampling/testing and combine with structural data of geology-seismic and perform history match of the reservoir dynamic modeling. The effect of balance of capillary and viscous forces in pore scale have been evaluated in the research. It has provided a reliable properties for a reservoir dynamic model. 
In the research, i have used similar range of reservoir and fluid properties such as pore throat size in reservoir range for pore network model. I analyze pore scale and field scale oil recovery during WAG at immiscible and near miscible condition to generate the three phase relative permeability models. The simulations at the reservoir scale shows that the highest oil recovery for the water-wet is obtained by injecting near miscible gas. Recovery increased by over 10% during WAG injection in agreement with typical values on SCAL and pore network models. 
The comprehensive approach of near miscible three phase flow WAG in pore network model, core-logs validation and the reservoir model are important in reservoir modelling. The integration is used for getting an appropriate relative permeability, capillary pressures and water saturation in near miscible Gas and Water Alternating Gas (WAG) flooding of reservoir. Thus it can give an accurate and robust of reservoir characterization, maximize oil recovery and optimum reservoir management.|","Three Phase Pore Scale and Reservoir Modeling, Near Miscible WAG Modeling, Improve Oil Recovery, Near Miscible PNM and Reservoir Model, Near Miscible Three Phase Flow of WAG"

Openhole (OH) multistage fracturing (MSF) is increasingly used to stimulate and maximize production within low-permeability reservoirs in unconventional plays globally, extending its use from tight sands, shales, and carbonate reservoirs. Technological breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing have helped enable OH MSF within lateral sections. 
The target reservoir is a tight heterogeneous carbonate with unsustainable productivity. The hydrocarbon produced is oil of relatively low API and gas/oil ratio (GOR). Given the challenging nature of the unconventional Mauddud reservoir of the Bahrah field, a sophisticated design of both the well completion and fracturing treatment is necessary to achieve the North Kuwait strategic production targets by maximizing reservoir contact and enhancingwell performance. 
A long horizontal well was drilled within the Mauddud reservoir. Completion technology was based on distributing swellable packers along the lateral section to develop MSF acidizing. 
The multistage packer and port designs were based on the reservoir mechanical and formation properties, to achievethe best fracture extension. Fracture acidizingwas performed on each stage, the well was flowed clean, and an electrical submersible pump (ESP) was run to produce the well. A production logging tool (PLT) survey was run immediately after fracture acidizing and six months after production. The recorded data indicated different contribution profiles of the stages, which indicated the fractures and production within such reservoirstake time to stabilize. 
This paper describes and addresses the effectiveness of MSF. Additionally, MSF performance in horizontal vs. vertical wells is assessed. Well performance analysis, exploitation approaches, and successful implementation are discussed, highlighting the advanced completion technology applied. The PLT results at different stages of the well life (post-acidizing and after ESP installation) are discussed. A comparison between the multifracture within the lateral section and vertical fractured well showed the benefit of the technology used to boost and sustain production. Effective horizontal drilling and MSF have helped enablethe development of unconventional resources, which were considered economically unfeasible previously.|","Production Optimization, Acid Fracturing, Marginal Field, Multi Stage Completion"

The Lower Arab D Member (Kimmeridgian) in onshore UAE is typically characterised by a thick succession of homogeneous mudstones with local cm-scale interbedded bivalve-rich floatstones, which are thought to have been deposited in a low-energy mid-ramp setting. This sedimentological unit is located at the base of a sour gas reservoir that includes the oolitic grainstones of the Upper Arab D Member. 
The pore system in these micritic deposits is dominated by matrix-hosted microporosity, along with open to partially cemented fractures, primary intraparticle macropores and rare biomoulds in the shell beds, hence a poor to very good porosity and extremely poor to rarely excellent permeability. Variations in porosity and permeability values appear to be strongly related to variations in the micritic fabric: both porosity and permeability increase when the micritic fabric evolves from anhedral compact with coalescent intercrystalline contacts (associated with very little and poorly connected micropores) to subrounded with facial to subpunctic intercrystalline contacts (with locally well-developed micropores). Micritic fabrics also clearly impact the elastic properties of the rock. Through analysis of elastic moduli calculated from standard density, and shear/compressional sonic wireline logs, the relationship between micritic fabric, porosity, permeability and geomechanical properties has been explored. With the evolution of micritic fabric from anhedral compact to subrounded, Young's Modulus decreases with increasing porosity and permeability, indicating a decrease in the overall stiffness of the mudstones. The implication of this observation is fundamental for the development of natural fractures within the Arab D, which are used as conduits for the vertical fluid flow. Indeed, stylolites with associated partially cemented tension gashes are commonly observed at the rheological boundaries, providing further secondary macroporosity and permeability anisotropy within the reservoir. 
In this study, the observed link between micritic fabrics, log-derived porosity and elastic moduli within cored intervals has been used to predict micron-scale micritic fabric distribution in uncored wells from wireline logs only.|","elastic properties, young's modulus, carbonates, microporosity"

In today’s challenging market conditions, the probability of successful well delivery can be increased and influenced by implementing fit-for-purpose pre-drill and real-time geomechanical solutions. These tailored geomechanical solutions add value to the project by delivering a cost-effective well, with reduced non-productive time (NPT), and a lower risk of health, safety, and environment (HSE) concerns. Geomechanics guided decision making, both in the pre-drill and in the real time phases, has a wide range of applications depending on the complexity present in the drilling environment, e.g., high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) regimes, reactive clays, depleted reservoirs, weak shales, highly stressed areas, etc. 
This paper discusses the application of advanced geomechanics in three specific drilling environments (a) drilling a highly deviated well in a transitional fault regime, onshore the Nile Delta, (b) mitigating wellbore instability caused by reactive shales, in the Middle East and (c) drilling lateral wells in a highly-stressed carbonate formation. The paper also discusses how integrated pre-drill and real-time geomechanical solutions helped in achieving drilling success without adding major cost to the project. 
In study (a) the operator had successfully drilled many vertical wells in the onshore field on the Nile Delta without significant problems, yet was having severe issues drilling deviated wells. A detailed pre-drill model revealed the possibility of a transitional faulting regime, in association with anisotropic rocks, drilled by a slick Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA), could be a major reason for this. Real-time geomechanics were deployed to validate the pre-drill understanding, along with mud additive recommendations and a slight modification to the drill string. In a different study (b) performed in another onshore Middle East field, there was a challenge to drill high-angle wells through troublesome shale formations, which resulted in various sidetracks and a significant amount of wellbore instability issues. These issues limited well configuration options for field development to near vertical wells. A pre-drill geomechanical study was carried out to understand the root cause of the failures that resulted in customized mud weight and mud type solutions for drilling higher angle wells. With these customized recommendations and later on a 3D Geomechanical model, horizontal wells have been drilled successfully for optimal draining of the reservoir resulting in breakthrough in field development plan. In study (c) there was significant wellbore instability challenges while drilling lateral wells through highly-stressed carbonate reservoir. A comprehensive study helped in understanding the geomechanical behavior. In example highlighted the drilling team was using lower than required mud weights in a horizontal well. The geomechanical model was adjusted considering time and space for specific case using the geomechanical understanding. The focused geomechanical modeling helped to adjust the mud weight. Suitable mud weight along with pseudo real-time monitoring helped in successful delivery of the horizontal well. 
The three studies presented are onshore. Conventional wisdom for onshore drilling has a bias for low-cost solutions. However, the complexity of each drilling campaign was different. In all the cases the adoption of integrated geomechanics through the planning and operation phase ensured successful project completion with minimal non-productive time (NPT).|","well planning, real-time, geomechanics"

Is there a proven methodology for designing optimum multi-stage completions in unconventional reservoirs? Where to place frac stages, perforation clusters, and how to avoid geo-hazards? This paper attempts to cover some of the fundamental aspects of stage placement and hydraulic fracturing designs by discussing lessons learned from several major US basins. 
A holistic data-driven approach to completion optimization is based on the analysis of the production potential, favorable rock mechanical properties, and geological features along the entire wellbore. Lateral reservoir characterization, including advanced cuttings and gas analysis, high-definition imaging technologies of logging while drilling (LWD), and wireline (WL) deep shear wave imaging (DSWI) is used to optimize completion and stimulation designs. The suggested methodology goes beyond the wellbore proximity and provides insight to practical application of advanced formation evaluation (FE) technologies. 
To address the challenges of lithological and horizontal stress heterogeneity of unconventional reservoirs and to optimize multi-stage completions, a combination of three primary categories of reservoir characteristics are considered: ""producibility"", ""fracability"", and geofeatures. Deep shear wave imaging technique identifies spatial natural fractures, faults, and other structural features up to 100 ft from the wellbore. This technology in combination with advanced cuttings and gas analysis helped identify and avoid faults, as well as target natural fractures for greater productivity and maximized economic return in several US basins. The analysis of field data suggests that geomechanical, petrophysical, and geochemistry data should be reviewed holistically. The post treatment analysis reveals a direct correlation of microseismic activity with the density of natural fractures obtained from DSWI processing. The strong correlation between surface treating pressure, breakdown pressure, and the fracture intensity was also observed. This information allows characterization of complex fracture networks, qualification of near-wellbore tortuosity, and estimation and modification of the hydraulic fracture design prior to the stimulation treatment. The intervals with lower horizontal stress and higher brittleness indexes are treated with lower pressure, and achieve the target pumping rates significantly faster than ""ductile"" stages. Case studies demonstrate up to 45% production increase compared to offset wells. 
As opposed to geometric stage placement, the suggested integrated completion strategy ensures targeted stimulation with the optimum reservoir contact at the maximum operational efficiency. Advanced formation evaluation techniques provide insight to mitigate risk and reduce uncertainty, therefore maximizing return on investment in multi-stage completions.|","Completion Optimization, Formation Evaluation, Hydraulic Fracturing, Risk Mitigation and Uncertainty Reduction, Unconventional Reservoirs"

Pore pressure prediction is essential part of wildcat well planning. In India, Tripura sub – basin is characterised by huge anticlines, normal faults and abnormally pressured formations. These factors push the wildcat well planning in this area into wide margin of uncertainty. Pore pressures were predicted from seismic velocities by using modified Eaton’s method over the synclinal and flank part of Atharamura to understand the pressure succession towards the anticline. These predicted pore pressure on the flank part lead to a reasonable match when plotted with offset well measured pore pressures. To reduce the uncertainty fracture pressure were established by various methods such as Hubbert & Willis method and Matthews & Kelly method from predicted pore pressures. But the fracture pressures were predicted with available horizontal stress correlations due to lack of Poisson’s ratio curve for the study area. The mud pressure required to drill the well is calculated using median line principle and hence drilling mud window is established by assuming virtual tight conditions. The plot of Equivalent Circulation Density (ECD) versus depth suggest that well can be drilled with two casing policy. But it is found that adding one more casing pipe will ensure the safety of well. Casing pipes were designed on the basis of collapse pressure, burst pressure and tensile load. Finally a well plan which includes pore pressure, fracture pressure, drilling mud policy, casing policy, kick tolerance graph were proposed to give clear picture on well planning on the top of the anticline in pore pressure point of view.|","casing policy, Pore pressure, fracture pressure, kick tolerance, mud pressure and mud weight"

Prediction of pore pressure in carbonate formations is a major challenge. When this challenge is combined with the possibility of abnormal pressure occurrence, accurate pore pressure prediction becomes a necessity. The over pore pressure intervals in those formations narrows the size of the drilling window to ~10 pcf (1.33 ppg) which requires high accuracy of pore pressure prediction. Inaccurate pore pressure data can lead to well-control incidents, poor casing designs, and inefficient reservoir modelling among other things. Therefore, a new model was developed to predict pore pressure in over pressured carbonate formation. 
By employing acoustic logging data, a correlation between the effective vertical stress and Poisson’s ratio was developed to be used in combination with formation bulk density measurements in order to predict the pore pressure in 3D space relying on the Poro-elasticity theory. Comparing the results of the prediction process with the available Modular formation Dynamics Tester (MDT) yielded a significant fit. Through this correlation, the abnormal variations in the high pressure carbonate are detected to a significant level of accuracy. 
Based on the produced correlation, the results of the pore pressure prediction process showed that the pressure gradient increases from 0.48 psi/ft to 0.52 psi/ft in adjacent carbonates. This gradient reached an abnormally high value at 0.95 psi/ft at the base of dolomitic formation, which then decreases at lower formation. Based on the true vertical depth of these high pressure sequences, this abnormal pressure gradient equates to around 140 pcf (18.7 ppg) mud weight. Having knowledge of this value is substantial for minimizing the number of kicks encountered in these zones.|","Acoustic Logs Data, 3D Pore Pressure Prediction, Density Log, Carbonates"

Accurate formation evaluation relies heavily on the quantification of rock matrix constituents. Rock mineralogy identification is commonly based on wireline spectroscopy measurements. Logging while drilling (LWD) techniques traditionally rely on density and neutron data to derive lithology. Historically, density and neutron tools that contain radioactive chemical sources were also the primary sensors used to determine porosity within the reservoir, which is a fundamental petrophysical attribute necessary to accurately quantify reserves. Although the potential irradiation and contamination risks associated with radioactive sources have always been known, the industry is now focusing toward reducing or eliminating their use, where possible. 
The alternative source-less sensors for density and neutron tools, such as acoustic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, were commonly used for porosity calculations. However, calculated porosities from acoustic measurements could contain significant errors arising from the uncertainty associated with the mineralogical composition. In addition, NMR porosity values can contain errors as a result of the effect of density and the hydrogen index of the hydrocarbons in place. 
Advanced cutting analysis (ACA), either by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and/or X-ray diffraction (XRD), provides an independent lithology from downhole tools. The lithology, matrix density, and slownesses computed from the minerals or directly measured by the XRD can, in turn, be used as input data for porosity calculations from sonic and/or NMR data. This helps to provide more accurate porosity measurements, as compared to the traditional calculated porosities, without using density and neutron tools. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) helps to enable the use of wellsite mineralogy, porosity, grain size distribution, and grain density from cuttings to calibrate the measurements from LWD acoustic and NMR tools. 
This paper presents a comprehensive, cost effective method for multimineral formation evaluation using a combination of LWD and advanced mud logging, without the use of radioactive sources.

Carbonate reservoirs dominate 70% of oil and 90% of gas reserves in Middle East region, and imbibition is the main mechanism for fracturing fluid up-take during hydraulic fracturing stimulation process. Due to highly heterogeneous nature of tight carbonate source rocks, it is crucial to understand effects of the imbibed fluid on the mechanical, morphological and flow properties of the carbonate rocks. While the influence of imbibed fluids on the wettability of carbonate reservoir has been studied intensively, the research on effects of imbibed fluids on the texture and mineralogy of the carbonate rocks is very limited. This paper aims to provide a conceptual approach and workflow to characterize and quantify microstructure and mineralogy changes resulting from the imbibed fluids. 
A thin-section of low permeability organic-rich carbonate rock sample with a dimension of 7mm <U+00D7> 7mm <U+00D7> 0.3mm (length <U+00D7> width <U+00D7> thickness) was used in the study. The sample was submerged into 2% KCl (pH = 7.1) fluid from one end to simulate the spontaneous imbibition process. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to capture the sample’s morphological change before and after spontaneous imbibition. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) mapping was used to study mineralogy changes (dissolution and precipitation) before and after fluid treatment. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) equipped with optical emission spectrometer (OES) detector has been used to quantify dissolved ion concentrations in the treatment fluid. Permeability and porosity were measured using core plugs (1"" in diameter <U+00D7> 1.5"" in length) before and after imbibition process with half-length of the sample submerged into the treatment fluid. 
The SEM images for the thin-section sample show three zones with distinct fluid up-take characters. In Zone I, which was submerged into the testing fluid, considerable mineral dissolution has been observed. In Zone III, which was above the testing fluid level, considerable mineral precipitation was detected. While in the transition zone (Zone II, which was between the above two zones around the water-air level), minor amount of mineral dissolution was observed. The mineralogy changes resulting from the dissolution and precipitation have been identified by EDS analysis in all three zones. Gypsum and calcite were found to be dissolved in the imbibed fluids, while gypsum was found to be deposited on the rock surface in zones above fluid level. The observed gypsum deposition might result from the dissolution of the gypsum and calcite and re-precipitaion later from the imbibition experiment due to water evaporation and/or from sample drying process. Absolute permeability and porosity measurements for core plug samples show that both increased after the imbibition process.|","Imbibition, tight carbonate source rocks, fluid-rock interaction"

Objectives/Scope: In this study, Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) is investigated in a naturally fractured Iranian oil field as a tool to mitigate under balanced drilling hazards due to its high Sulfur content; and fluid losses and other problems that are inherent to conventional over balanced drilling. 
Methods, Procedures, Process: MPD was identified, planed, and applied in an already drilled well, as an alternative technology, to calculate the increase in its rate of penetration (ROP). The calculations were made by Schulumberger Drilling Office package and quality checked by using Signa ERDS software. The software simulates drilling fluid dynamics to investigate application of drillind hydraulics to better chose the optimum drilling technique. Well drilling fluid properties, bottom-hole assembly, casing/completion design and rock formation properties are implemented as an input to the software to start calculations. 
Results, Observations, Conclusions: The subject of this study was drilled in south west of Iran. Drilling experiences in this area identified the rock formation as a brittle, highly fractured, which negatively impacts drilling time and cost. Also, in certain instances, elevated mud weights are required to deal with high-pressure high sulfur content gas and/or water flows. Calculation shows that in shallow depths (0-470.8 ft, dd) due to low pore pressure, drilling mud is in balance and within pressure window. At deeper depths (470.8-7211.3 ft, dd) drilling is MPD and increase in mud pressure is required. At (7211.3-9530.8 ft, dd) depths, sharp changes in reservoir pore-pressure cause different increases in mud pressure (from 90 to 600 psi). At deeper depths (9530.8-13154.5 ft, dd) an increase in mud pressure may cause formation fracture, so it is suggested to continue overbalance drilling or separate the well bore by casing. If the formation is separated in previous section, drilling from 9530.8 to 13154.5 ft, dd, pressure management can be continued with an increase in applied back pressure in order to stop toxic gas hazards. At deeper depths (more than 13154.5 ft) according to high depth and dramatic pressure increase, it is suggested to continue MPD to prevent formation damage or induced fracturing and also prevent H2S influxes into annulus. 
Novel/Additive Information: Tts the first time to apply MPD technique in a drilling well design in this filed as a solution to challenging drilling conditions like narrow pressure window, Toxic gas hazards, sever mud loss problems, differential stocking and blow out risks. Such results may result in a significant improvement in drilling economics.|","Under balanced drilling, Fractured Reservoir, High Sulfur Content, Over balanced drilling, Managed Pressure Drilling"

One of the sources of damage in stimulated carbonate rock is the loss of near wellbore formation compressive strength which may results in casing collapse under extreme conditions. Field studies have shown that the failure of acidized rock may cause damage and thereby negatively impact production. In this work, an integrated analysis workflow is presented to simulate acid placement in carbonate reservoirs and model stimulated rock behavior during the productive lifetime of the well. The workflow is utilized to design a unique approach to horizontal wellbore acidizing and optimize the strategy to maximize hydrocarbon recovery. 
The presented workflow is based on the interaction between the distributions of reactive fluid along a wellbore, a two scale continuum model to simulate porosity evolution during stimulation, and stimulated rock performance during production time. The model first simulates stimulation fluid movement in the wellbore and couples it with transient reservoir flow. The primary analysis provides the distribution of reactive fluid along the well. The rock dissolution at each section of reservoir is then analyzed by continuum two-scale model (pore-scale and Darcy scale). This analysis presents porosity evolution at different locations along the well and at different radial distance from the wellbore center. Then, the developed geomechanical engine simulates the weakened rock under the in-situ stresses and bottom-hole pressure and predicts any possible compressional or shear failure. The effect of rock failure is then considered on the production prediction. 
The workflow is best used to analyze and optimize acid stimulation for a horizontal well. The analysis results show that the induced wormholes are stable and open since reservoir depletion increases the effective mean stress. At the elevated mean effective stress, wormholes or pores start to collapse and the failure extended away from near wellbore region and neutralized the stimulation effects. Since in the acid treated zone the rock is softened, the stress concentration around the wellbore might extended more into the reservoir. Analyzing this phenomenon showed that at a certain level of lowered stress concentration extension, in other words at certain strength and volume of acid, the wormhole can be stable and open during expected production time. Furthermore, the coupled analysis also demonstrates that at specific environment, the wormholes penetrated further into the rock, longer than possible 
induced failure. The workflow can be used to determine how weak or strong the acid should be at specific environmental condition to have longer life for the induced wormholes and hence extra hydrocarbon recovery.|","Improved Recovery, Geomechanics, Carbonate Acidizing"

Carbonate reservoirs are complex and require care in choosing an appropriate velocity model (Rafavich et al, 1984; Wang et al, 1991). Saudi Aramco has recently conducted a study to understand the effect of saturation and pore structure on the velocity of a particular Middle Jurassic carbonate reservoir in Saudi Arabia (Ayadiuno et al, 2015). As part of the study, several velocity models were empirically developed as a function of pore fluid type, density, and porosity. The study results suggested that at low velocity values, the obtained brine saturated core model correlated with Pickett while oil saturated core model correlated with Castagna (Ayadiuno et al, 2015). However, at high velocity values, the obtained models didn’t correlate with the published models. In addition, the study suggests that rock’s compressibility is less dependent on pore fluid type when the aspect ratio of the pores is high (Ayadiuno et al, 2015). 
In this paper, three core-derived velocity models, developed as part of the earlier study (Ayadiuno et al., 2015), at 100% water saturation were extended and validated on the Middle Jurassic carbonate reservoir across four fields in Saudi Arabia. These models are: (1) compressional velocity as a function of total porosity (Model A), (2) compressional velocity as a function of bulk density (Model B), and (3) shear velocity as a function of compressional velocity (Model C). A total of 11 wells from four fields were selected to validate the velocity models. Fluid substitution was performed using log data and water as in-situ fluid to reduce prediction uncertainty related to the differences in saturation fluid type. In addition, we addressed the difference in scale between data used to develop the models (core plugs) and data used to validate the models (well logs). 
Our findings are summarized as follows: (1) Model A, velocity as a function of porosity, is less sensitive to changes in rock stiffness and thus, is more reliable than Model B, (2) Model C, which predicts shear velocity, shows an overall better estimation of shear velocity than publicly available carbonate models from Castagna et al, (1985) and Pickett (1963). Thus, velocity models obtained from the study are more applicable to the four fields than published (Castagna and Pickett) models. The evaluation of these internally-developed carbonate velocity models across different fields shows a promising result in decreasing the uncertainty of velocity estimation in the Middle-Jurassic carbonate reservoir in Saudi Arabia. This work emphasizes the importance of assessing factors that affect acoustic properties, as well as the importance of multi-scale integration between core-plug measurements and logs.|","carbonate, velocity model, fluid substitution"

Minimum requirements for kick tolerance (KT) in Maersk Oil corporate standards drove implementation of analysis using a dispersed model instead of a single-bubble model to achieve more realistic KT values for a planned high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) exploration well with oil-based drilling fluids. 
The large uncertainty bands of predicted pore and fracture pressures in an HPHT exploration well offshore Norway had driven the casing design, which had very narrow margins and little flexibility in setting depths for the casing strings. KT analysis using a single-bubble model indicated allowable kick volumes of less than the required 50bbl minimum. To comply fully with the 50bbl KT, additional casing strings would be required, with several liners and/or unconventional casing sizes, adding further complexity, cost, and risk to the well and the operations. The development of a well control bridging document, including HPHT procedures, competency assurance of the crew, and use of real-time pore pressure prediction service was considered inadequate to fully manage the associated well control risk. 
The benefit of accepting the less than 50bbl KT would be to enable drilling of the HPHT exploration well with the planned five-string casing design, which was already more robust than in most of the offset wells, which utilized a four-string design. With the five-casing-string approach, there is little room for a contingency casing/liner string without possible compromise of some of the well objectives. 
An internal dispensation process was initiated due to the noncompliance with Maersk Oil corporate standards. To secure dispensation from such corporate standards, transient drilling modeling software was used to calculate updated KT on the basis of the dispersed kick (gas) model. In addition, a plan was put in place to update the well model and recalculate KT using real-time well information. 
This case history presents the story of KT analysis of the subject well, including transient drilling modeling to investigate the sensitivity of input parameters. Furthermore, a description of the software's use to assure safe drilling operations is discussed. Lessons learnt from use of this software during planning and well construction will also be discussed.|","HPHT Drilling, Kick Tolerance, Transient Drilling Modelling, Exploration, Dispersed Gas Model"

A comprehensive integrated methodology is presented that assesses rock hydraulic fracability using rock geomechanics, mineralogy, and chemical compositions. This petrophysical multi-min based approach utilizes sonic and density log data to relate mineralogy and geomechanics to rock stiffness and its susceptibility to fracture. 
Rock fracability is assessed in terms of compressional and shear transit times from borehole acoustic logging. These transit times are used to calculate Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus that provide an indication of the tendency of a rock to fracture while preserving the opening of the fracture. The lower the Poisson's ratio, the more brittle is the rock and the higher the value of Young's modulus. Brittleness index and fracability index are introduced to predict fracable rocks; sands with a brittleness index of 50 and higher and fracability index above 0 and less than 1 are fracable candidates. 
This geomechanical analysis is combined with rock mineralogy to make conclusive predictions about rock fracability. Rocks rich in silicates and sufficient clay volumes exhibit high rock fracability while ductile rocks negatively impact fracability. The success of the hydraulic fracturing jobs was observed to be directly related to rock mineralogy. The mineralogy groups for the wells in study were silicates (Quartz and Orthoclase) and clays (Illite, Kaolinite, and Chlorite). Quartz associated with sufficient Illite volumes promoted fracability. However, high contents of Kaolinite led to unfavorable results, whereas small quantities of Chlorite positively impacted fracability and promoted well deliverability. The integrated approach showed good predictability and consistency of rock fracability with a certain degree of error (within 10%).

Production from unconventional reservoirs is influenced by well spacing and induced fracture placement as well as the interaction between hydraulic fractures and in-place natural fracture systems. The purpose of modeling of these complex systems is to evaluate how production can be maximized while maintaining operational efficiencies, which promote reduced well pad footprints and effective fracture stage placement. 
Comingled flow conduits in unconventional reservoirs exist as amalgamated fracture systems, and multidisciplinary characterization with analysis from geologists, geophysicists, and engineers is necessary to maintain a consistent subsurface representation. To extend model fidelity in the description of complex fracture systems, a workflow was developed to evaluate the spatial constraint of natural fractures based on use of a fault indicator in cases where correlation exists between faults and fractures as a result of exerted structural controls. Use of the fault likelihood attribute in the development of an unconventional reservoir confirms that some of the better producing wells have been completed near heavily faulted zones; however, such increased productivity can also be hindered when pressure communication is established between wells associated with the same fault block. 
An examination of an Eagle Ford formation was conducted, highlighting how a consistent subsurface description not only enabled increased efficiency in future wells and hydraulic fracture placement but also promoted reduced drilling and completion costs as well as increased field productivity. This was achieved by combining fault likelihood constrained natural fracture network (NFN) as well as dynamic simulation of the stimulated and external reservoir volume, incorporating a petro-elastic model (PEM) to preserve geologic continuity between seismic attributes and the simulation.|","Fault Likelihood, Natural Fracture, Seismic Attribute, Fracture Productivity, Petro-Elastic Modeling"

This article describes the development, validation, and application of a fully coupled Finite Element (FE) framework for modeling of hydraulic fractures in the context of a diverse set of oil & gas (O&G) problems. The models have been developed within a fully-implicit non-linear FE solver, and comprise two widely established fracture modeling methods: Cohesive Zone Method or CZM (mesh conforms to a pre-defined fracture path) and eXtended Finite Element Method or XFEM (fracture geometry evolves independent of the finite element mesh). 
The models were verified by comparing simulation results with analytical solutions for the four asymptotic regimes of fracture propagation. The models were also experimentally validated, which involved comparing simulations with carefully conducted polyaxial fracturing experiments. For this purpose, a comprehensive set of laboratory-scale polyaxial fracturing experiments were conducted. Then, the finite element models were used to simulate these experiments, and the simulation results were compared with the experimental results. 
The applicability of these models spans conventional as well unconventional fracturing problems, including 3D multi-zone injection, diagnostic fracture injection tests, and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. To demonstrate this, a number of field-scale models are constructed and applied to a broad range of O&G problems involving fracture propagation at large length and time scales. These include a Step Rate Test (SRT), a Produced Water Re-injection (PWRI) problem, and a Cuttings Re-Injection (CRI) simulation. These large length- and time-scale simulations were enabled by a high-performance, massively parallel computing system. 
Through the various validation exercises and the field examples discussed in this work, we intend to demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed fracture modeling capabilities in successfully simulating real problems ranging from laboratory-scale to field-scale.|","Advance Fracture Modeling:"

Several techniques for hydraulically fracturing design were conducted in the liquid-rich Eagle Ford developments. This study shows that different results were observed due to the variation of geomechanical stresses of the rock across a play and reservoir properties. An optimum treatment for a liquids-rich objective is much different than that for a gas shale primarily due to the multiphase flow and higher viscosities encountered. 
This paper presents a treatment workflow that has been used with liquids-rich window of the Eagle Ford Shale. Review and integration of data from multiple sets across the play were used as input to a 3D hydraulic fracture simulator to model key fracture parameters which control production enhancement. These results were then used with production analysis and forecast, well optimization, and economic model to compare which treatment designs yield the best placement of proppant to deliver both high initial production and long term ultimate recoveries. 
A key focus for this workflow was to maximize proppant transport to achieve a continuous - optimum conductive - fracture half length. Often, due to the complexity of unconventional deposition, it is difficult to maintain complete connectivity of a proppant pack back to the wellbore. As a result, much of the potential of the fracture network is lost. Understanding the interaction of a hydraulic fracture and the rock fabric helps with the design of this behavior to achieve best results. These results can then be used for determining optimum well spacing to effectively develop a selected reservoir acreage. 
Currently, there are numerous wells and over two years of production history in much of the Eagle Ford. Comparison of these production results demonstrate the importance of employing a diligent workflow to integrate the sciences so that a proper understanding and application of hydraulic fracturing modeling can be achieved.|","3D Frac Modeling, Proppant Transport, Reservoir Development, Geomechanical Properties, Liquid play"

In the Middle East, a significant amount of Non-Productive Time (NPT) has been associated with controlling wellbore instability caused by weak shale before reaching the reservoir. Due to limited availability of pad locations and complex well trajectories, operators are now forced to drill high angle wells through shale as compared to vertical or low angle wells in the past. This has resulted in a substantial increase in drilling complications in terms of controlling shale instability. 
Comprehensive geomechanical studies from various fields of Middle-East have helped to determine most plausible root causes of shale rock instability and to draw a holistic geomechanical approach to solve the problem. Shale samples (core and cuttings) were collected from multiple fields, and various types of lab tests were performed on these samples including XRD, XRF, chemical tests, rock mechanical tests etc. Geomechanical modeling and drilling analysis were performed to compare the drilling events to the shale characteristics in order to determine the mechanisms of rock failure. Chemoporoelastic and plane of weakness modeling techniques were also performed to understand some less-common failure mechanisms that were driving instability within these shales. 
It was noted from the analysis that not all shales behave in a similar fashion. A potential solution that may solve instability problem in a particular field/region might not be effective in the other field/region. Geomechanical analysis suggested that a range of shale instability mechanisms ranging from stress induced failures and planes of weakness to complex rock-fluid interaction were responsible for hole instability, and different mud and drilling parameters are required to keep the hole stable in different shales. Raising the mud weight exclusively during drilling of these shales with multiple failure mechanisms was found to be ineffective and potentially counter-productive. A customized solution along with real-time geomechanics monitoring can help to mitigate shale instability in drilling of high angle wells. 
A customized methodology for shale stability has been proposed in this paper based on integrated mechanical and chemical characteristics of most commonly encountered shales in the Middle East. This approach has helped to devise a comprehensive as well as practical approach to enhance drilling efficiency through shales in various fields in the region.|","Wellbore Stability, Shale Stability, Weak Plane Failure"

Dynamic hydraulics modeling and multi-phase kick tolerance analysis on a narrow margin deepwater well in offshore Malaysia created realistic and accurate pressure predictions, enabling the well to be drilled safely and efficiently and ultimately gave access to additional potential reserves. If conventional modelling alone had been used in the well design, then the well would have been deemed un-drillable, with a predicted drilling window as low as 0.46 ppg. Dynamic modeling delivered greater insight into the pressure and temperature transients throughout the drilling, tripping, casing, cementing and well killing operations. 
The well planning process took into account pore pressure and wellbore stability predictions and the drilling risks identified in offset wells, but also included dynamic ECD/ESD simulations and dynamic multiphase kick tolerance modeling to evaluate the drill-ability of each casing seat design. The operational effects of frictional pressure losses through the RCD and MPD lines, mud properties, booster pump rate management and detailed mud rollover plan were also included. The transient analysis increased the drillers’ confidence in accessing this challenging horizon safely. The dynamic simulations included many drilling input parameters, such as pump rates, mud weight schedules, tripping rates, well control events and cementing schedules, giving greater insight to the operations team, allowing for smoother well construction activities. Operational decision trees and a pore pressure communication protocol established during the well planning stage helped optimize overall performance. During execution of the drilling operations, the pre-drill models were continually updated based on the actual parameters observed, including real time pore pressures, leak off tests and mud temperatures, to ensure wellbore pressures were well managed, thereby minimizing drilling risks related to wellbore stability and pore pressure. Pre-section modeling and real-time monitoring assisted the operations team in decision making, saving costs and allowing the well to reach maximum drillable depth safely. Overall two casing strings were eliminated, which translated to 21% drilling cost reduction and 9.5 days saving. This narrow margin well pushed the well engineers to look beyond the traditional methods of well planning using steady state modeling, which is inherrantly conservative. Through the use of dynamic modeling, replicating the real drilling operations more accurately, increased operational margins were identified, allowing the well to be drilled safely and efficiently.|","Dynamic Modeling, Drilling Software, Narrow Margin Drilling"

It is a common misconception, upon installation of an acoustic sand monitoring system, that the acoustic systems should provide an accurate measurement of sand volumes and that all sand detection issues are immediately solved. The truth is there is more to that than just installing a piece of equipment and hoping that it would provide us a crystal ball insight to the sand produced. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to share the top 7 learnings our asset has experienced on managing acoustic sand monitoring systems. 
The 7 Sins that would be discussed are: |Knowing if it is sand and underestimating external noise 
Lack of continuous calibration of the acoustic systems 
Trusting solely the calculated sand volumes 
Lack of data correlation with other available field data 
Understanding trends from acoustic systems does not happen overnight, practice makes perfect 
Not acknowledging undetected sand (fines) 
Not realising that acoustic systems are just a small part of the bigger sand management picture |In each learning, field example cases will be presented where both positive and negative results will be described and discussed.

Keshen is a high-pressure/high temperature (HP/HT) tight-sandstone gas reservoir with reservoir pressure over 110 MPa and temperature over 175°C. The sandstone is very hard, with unconfined compressive strength (UCS) greater than 100 MPa. Given the HP/HT nature and natural fracture system in the reservoir, with aid of stimulation, many wells produced at a very high rate with the mean value exceeding 500,000 m3/d. In the last few years, many production wells in this reservoir experienced severe sanding issues that contradicted the conventional understanding that sanding would not occur in such hard rock. The sanding wells exhibited large fluctuations of production rate and wellhead pressure, erosion of chocks and nozzles, and eventually major or even complete loss of production. A solution to address the sanding issues was urgently needed because the sanding issues had caused a major decline in production and resulted in significant economic loss. 
Due to the unconventional nature of the sanding issues, the typical sanding prediction methods based on solely on evaluating rock failure were not adequate to reveal the underlying sanding mechanism and develop a viable operational solution to address the sanding issues. To this end, a new workflow was formulated and applied to this study. The workflow started with detailed data mining on the massive amount of drilling, completion, stimulation, and production data from this reservoir to investigate possible relationships of drilling practices, completion options, and production schedules to the occurrence and severity of sanding issues. The analysis revealed that downhole flow velocity and production drawdown were the two major controlling factors in the occurrence of sand production. Further geomechanics simulation and particle migration simulation with a multiphase dynamic flow simulator confirmed that the production drawdown would cause failure of the rock near the wellbore and the gas flow could transport the sand debris to the wellbore and lift it up to the surface. In addition, the fluctuation of production rate was caused by blockage due to accumulation in the wells and production tubing of sand particles that were flushed out after downhole pressure buildup. 
Based on the analysis, the threshold of flow velocity and the threshold of drawdown were identified, and these thresholds can be used in the reservoir management to address the sanding issues. 
The experience in Keshen shows that sanding is possible in HP/HT high-productivity sandstone gas reservoirs, even in extremely hard formation, which overturns some prior conceptions on sanding. The information shared from this paper could bring up the attention of those operating similar HP/HT tight sandstone reservoirs around the world.|","HPHT, Tight Sandstone, Western China, Sanding"

Carbonate reservoirs are of strong heterogeneity. Their geological features and dynamic behaviors vary significantly for different types of carbonates. Characterizing the distribution of different types of carbonates and proposing different development strategies are critical for a successful development of carbonate reservoirs. This paper focuses on a super-giant carbonate reservoir with OOIP (Original Oil in Place) of more than 20 billion barrels. However, it has been naturally depleted over the past 40 years. Its reservoir pressure is approaching the bubble point pressure. Therefore, it is critical and urgent to propose optimized water flooding plan for this reservoir. 
In this paper, the dataset includes seismic data, well logs, production history, dynamic surveillance data, et al. Firstly, three reservoir types are characterized as good, medium and poor reservoirs based on static and dynamic data. Then, the stacking patterns of different reservoir types are concluded and their distributions are determined, which provide us the foundation to propose customized water flooding plan. Finally, the water flooding performances of different stacking patterns are analyzed and full-field development strategies are proposed based on fine-scale geological modeling and numerical simulation. 
Results indicate that stacking pattern has intimate relationship with facies map. For example, the distribution of stacking pattern A, in which good reservoir accounts for the majority, is consistent with the distribution of favorable grainstone shore facies, indicating very good reservoir quality that resulted in higher production rate, longer stable production period, and slow decline. In addition, different offtakes, well patterns, pressure maintenance, well types of different reservoir stacking pattern are determined based on the simulation results and distribution of different stacking patterns. The EUR is increased by more than 20% compared with natural depletion. 
This paper offers a reference case of grouping different types of reservoirs and proposing customized water flooding plan, which help engineers and geologists to better develop other similar fields.|","Numerical simulation, Development optimization, Carbonate reservoir, Reservoir characterization"

The gas flow in shale matrix is of great research interest for optimizing shale gas reservoir development. Due to a nano-scale pore radius, the gas flow in the shale matrix may fall in flow regimes which include viscous flow, slip flow and Knudsen diffusion. On top of that, the adsorbed and free gas is stored in nano-scale organic pores. The gas molecules are attached as a monolayer to pore walls to form a film of gas which is the thickness of the adsorbed layer. When a reservoir is depleted, the attached gas molecules will be released so that the radius of organic pores in which the free gas flows is changeable. Thus a sorption-dependent radius will be introduced to the apparent permeability which represents the flow regimes. Stress sensitivity will also be investigated via a two-way coupling geomechanics process. In this paper, we introduce a novel integrated numerical simulation scheme to quantify the above phenomena which is crucial for the shale gas reservoir development. 
Instead of Darcy's equation, we implement the sorption-dependent apparent permeability in the continuity equation to depict the gas flow (viscous flow, slip flow and Knudsen diffusion) in shale matrix. The methodology which was developed by Vasina et al. and validated through comparing with molecular simulation will be implemented to determine the thickness of an adsorbed layer at each time step. The Langmuir adsorption/desorption term is included in the continuity equation as an accumulation term. In addition, lab data for a Bakken reservoir which provides a relationship between a matrix pore radius reduction and the effective stress is integrated into the two-way coupling geomechanical process to simulate a stress-sensitive shale formation. 
This methodology examines the influence of each mechanism for the shale gas flow in the matrix. Overall, the sorption-dependent apparent permeability is smaller than the sorption-independent apparent permeability, which leads to the pressure maintenance for the sorption-dependent apparent permeability case. The sorption-dependent apparent permeability will lead to additional heterogeneity. The apparent permeability near a wellbore is bigger than the one far away from the wellbore, which causes the pressure transmit more easily around the production side. With the consideration of geomechanics, the apparent permeability is decreased due to the compaction of a nano-scale pore radius, which leads to the maintenance of reservoir pressure. Due to the difference of compaction magnitude for each grid block, geomechanics also creates additional heterogeneity for a nano-pore network in shale matrix, which we should pay more attention to. 
The sorption-dependent radius is incorporated into the apparent permeability model to depict the sorption-dependent apparent permeability of shale matrix. We provide a novel integrated methodology to quantify the crucial transient phenomena in the shale matrix, which includes flow regimes, gas adsorption/desorption and stress sensitivity.|","two-way coupling geomechanics, integrated methodology, apparent permeability, sorption-dependent pore radius, transient gas flow"

China’s Sichuan Basin contains prolific gas fields and presents many drilling challenges due to the complex structural geology. Xujiahe is one of the most challenging formations in the basin. The interbedded and hard, abrasive nature of Xujiahe results in short intervals drilled and low rates of penetration (ROP). 
Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bits have limited drilling efficiency in this formation because impact damage and abrasive wear lead to short intervals drilled and very low ROP. Seven-bladed PDC bits which replaced roller cones were once believed to be the most cost-effective solution. To expedite gas exploration, improve ROP and increase distance drilled in the Gaoshiti-Moxi block, an innovative application-specific engineering drill bit was required. 
To identify the solution, a cross-functional team from the drilling contractor and the service company conducted extensive technical research into drilling practices. Sophisticated software was used to analyze the rock properties, and to identify the formation drilling problems. Reviews of offset drill bits provided clues to drilling challenges. After a series of technical analyses, an application-specific hybrid bit was designed and tested in this block. Continuous optimization of drilling parameters is implemented by field engineer. 
The first three trials drilled through this formation, saving two PDC bits and two trips over a 500-meter interval. Post-run review and analysis of the first trials was conducted for further improvement of ROP and interval drilling using drilling parameter and bottomhole assembly (BHA) optimization. One fast run with an average of 45% better ROP was achieved on following runs. This saved seven drilling days and 2.5 runs; an average savings of 180,000USD per well.

A new method is developed by using machine learning technique to forecast single well production in both conventional and unconventional reservoirs. Unlike investigating and analyzing existing wells production rate and decline curve, this method predicts new well production rate according to reservoir properties such as matrix permeability, porosity, formation pressure and temperature, as well as hydraulic fracture parameters including fracture half length, fracture width and fracture conductivity. 
In this paper, an inversion scheme is coupled with decline curve model, Logistic Growth Model (LGM), to obtain a set of decline curve parameters by fitting with production data. Both the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and sensitivity study are applied to analyze the variance and identify key factors that influence production rate from reservoir and hydraulic fracture parameters. The sensitivity analysis results and scree plot from PCA serve as references to select key factors. Lastly, Neural Network (NN) technology is applied to investigate the pattern and correlation of selected reservoir and hydraulic fracture parameters and decline curve parameters. Therefore, the NN model can be applied to forecast production rate for a new well according to given reservoir and hydraulic information. 
There is a good agreement between the available production data and decline curve model predicated production data based on the inverted decline curve model parameters. The scree plot and bi-plot generated by PCA provide the weight percentage of each component and help to identify factors that should be considered. Field production data is used to verify the feasibility of this method. This field case study is conducted by fitting the predicted production data (decline curve) based on NN model with field production data. The Mean Squared Estimation (MSE) of NN model is 0.013 Mscf/D and the overall R value is 0.917. This indicates that NN model is reliable to study the dataset and provide proper production (decline curve) prediction. The results illustrate that the predicted production data (decline curve) has good accuracy. 
This paper proposes a statistical way for production forecasting based on machine learning. Instead of forecasting future production of existing wells, it provides meaningful reference for the evaluation of a new well and decision making.|","Decline Curve Analysis, hydraulic fractures, Reservoir Properties, Unconventional Reservoirs, Machine Learning"

Understanding the mechanisms of fluid flow in unconventional shale reservoirs is of great interest as these mechanisms have significant impacts on long term economic development of such reservoirs. In shale rocks, the average size of pore/throat is much smaller than the average pore size in conventional rocks which results in higher capillary pressures. Such high capillary pressures can strongly influence the two-phase flow specifically around the wellbore by preventing the fluid flow from matrix to hydraulic fractures and resulting in liquid holdup. In addition, the pronounced poroelastic properties of shale matrix make the flow properties to be extremely sensitive to the effective stress. As a result, the production rate and well deliverability of shale reservoirs can be severely affected by stress dependent capillary pressure around the wellbore area while this impact has not been investigated yet. In this study, a numerical approach was adapted to solve the analytical formulation of two-phase flow considering the capillary and viscous forces in matrix around hydraulic fractures. To evaluate the integrity of the simulation results, the predicted liquid saturation profiles were compared with some experimental data reported in the literature where liquid saturation profiles were measured by CT scanner under both viscous and capillary dominated flow conditions. Then, the two phase flow in tight formations were simulated and the obtained liquid saturation profiles were used to estimate the equivalent relative permeability curves at different stress conditions. The results showed that the liquid holdup in the matrix around the hydraulic fractures can be accumulated even up to a meter that significantly reduces the relative permeability values in this zone. This liquid holdup (or capillary end effects) depends on several parameters including effective stress applied to the formations. In addition, the effects of viscous forces on liquid holdup were investigated in terms of fluid velocity. It is found that, a higher fluid velocity(or flow rate) which can be achieved by increasing drawdown pressure (reduction of bottom hole pressure) can cause a significant damage to the matrix permeability around the hydraulic fractures. This damage also adversely affects flow and can promote the capillary dominated flow. The results of this study improve our understanding of flow mechanisms in unconventional reservoir rocks. This knowledge is required for shale reservoir simulation and cost effective production from hydraulic fractured wells in shale reservoirs.|","Liquid holdup, Tight formations, Shale Reservoirs, Capillary end effect, Stress dependent capillary pressure"

Friction angle variations from experimental data conducted at UNGI for seal and organic-rich formations along with the literature data have been used to present occurrence of significant alterations in critically stressed fault frictional behavior with the changes in wettability, saturation and lithology near hydraulic fracturing and waste disposal injection sites. The rock-fluid interactions were introduced to explain the changes that were not considered in prior analysis in addition to the conventionally used fluid pressure alterations.

Crack initiation and slip along pre-existing discontinuities were evaluated using Itasca’s FLAC3D software and compared to mine seismicity. Results were used to evaluate expected changes in seismically active volumes with planned production. Hanging-wall seismicity was correlated with the location of plastic failure in the models, as well as differential stress near the production front. Less clear relationships existed between footwall seismicity and model results, however, many orientations of discontinues have the possibility to slip, and therefore may contribute to seismicity. Patterns in orientations of discontinuities that can slip were consistent in the footwall drifts relative to the active production level, regardless of the depth of production evaluated. In general, the models did not indicate any expected changes in seismically active volumes with planned production. |1. INTRODUCTION |It is undisputable that an understanding of the phenomena of seismicity in rock masses will improve mine safety. Although prediction of specific seismic events does not seem achievable (e.g. McKinnon, 2006), identification of areas that have a higher risk of seismic activity seems within reach. Numerical stress analysis models are the leading-edge tools to understand rock mass behaviour, and much effort has been put towards the modelling of seismicity (e.g. Diederichs, 2000; Andrieux et al., 2008; Beck et al., 2009; Sjoberg et al., 2011; Ghazvinian et al., 2014). However, to date, a standardised and accepted strategy to numerically model seismicity that successfully reproduces this behaviour for all cases does not exist.|","crack initiation,  slip,  mine-scale, Mine seismicity,  stress analysis,  numerical modelling"

Observing the fracture geometry in field treatments is almost impossible, except in special tests with extensive seismic monitoring (Abe et al., 1983; Vinegar et al., 1992), even in those cases it is believed (de Pater et al., 1994) the data interpretation needs to be more developed. To better understand the behavior of rock during a hydraulic fracturing treatment, numerous studies have been undertaken and several physical models developed to investigate rock behavior during the injection. Laboratory tests should, therefore, serve as benchmarks for numerical simulations. |In this study, an innovative two-dimensional set-up is introduced for conducting hydraulic fracturing on low-strength rock-like materials. |1. BACKGROUND |There are three different approaches for simulating crack propagation. (1) Analytical, (2) Numerical and (3) physical models are introduced and related literature are summarized.|","Experimental set-up,  Hydraulic Fracturing,  transparent material,  Crack initiation, Rock-Like Materials"

However, the capability of the modelling methods has yet remained open for question. In an attempt to address the shortcomings of the existing methods, this paper proposes a new extension of combined finite/discrete element method (FEM/DEM), which takes into account the mix-mode I-II fracture criteria for predicting the initiation and propagation of cracks. The code’s ability in modelling rock fracture process is investigated by simulating fragmentation with a mechanical cutter. The model characterized the rock-tool interaction, computing the direction of crack growth leading to chip generation. The obtained results demonstrated the capability of the proposed combined FEM/DEM method in modelling mechanical rock cutting process. The code could successfully handle the chipping process, being able to model the stress concentration, crack initiation, crack propagation and chip separation. |1. INTRODUCTION |During the past decades the application of mechanical tools for rock fragmentation has been extended widely in mining and civil engineering industries; providing a more flexible and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional blasting method. However, the rock fragmentation mechanism with a mechanical cutter has not well understood due to the complexity of the dynamic interaction between mechanical tool and rock, and rock fracture process (Ghamgosar and Erarslan, 2015). While rock cutting experiments are largely used to investigate the cutting process and the associated cutting forces, the extensive number of variables and effective factors influencing the process have made the application of these tests relatively limited. The developed analytical and empirical methods also suffer from same drawback. The recent advancements in numerical modelling methods have confirmed to provide robust tools for simulation of complex problems. Hence, different numerical techniques have been considered for investigation of rock fracture process. The rock cutting process comprises of four stages that should be addressed in a numerical simulation; 1) generation of crushed zone under the tool, 2) cracks initiation and propagation from crushed zone, 3) cracks coalescence and chipping process 4) chip separation. Not all of the numerical techniques are able to model the entire rock cutting process.|","Mechanical rock cutting,  combined FEM/DEM, Numerical simulation"

One of the methods to store the solar energy is the borehole thermal energy storage (BTES), where the thermal energy is stored in the rock mass using borehole heat exchangers. This study presents preliminary results of numerical predictions for an in situ experiment of underground thermal energy storage in the research tunnel under Otaniemi campus. The in-situ experiment site consists of two horizontal boreholes of 5 m length drilled into granitic rock. One borehole is equipped with a single U-tube heat exchanger, and the hot water is circulated through it to heat up the rocks, while the second hole is used for temperature measurement of the rock. The in situ experiment set-up is modelled numerically using finite element method to investigate the influencing factors and predict its long-term thermal performance. The three-dimensional problem is solved with the transient heat conduction equations and the temperature distribution in the subsurface is obtained during 21 days of operation. A parametric study is performed to find the optimal operating conditions. The results of the numerical predictions are used for a detailed plan of the experiment. The simulated results will be later compared to the measured values obtained in the experiment. |1. INTRODUCTION |The problem of the global climate change requires a considerable effort to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by increasing the use of renewable sources of energy. The public awareness to use alternative energy sources is growing, and market possibilities are emerging. Besides the solar electricity produced by photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, one of the typical applications of renewable energy is the solar heat, where energy from the sun is used to heat up water and space in buildings. Although the price of PV cells is continuing to drop dramatically every year (Kurtz et al., 2017), the solar thermal energy is still considered to be simpler to storage for extended time periods. The seasonal storage is of particular importance in high latitudes, as it is the case in Finland, where solar insolation is highest in the summer when the heating demand is low and lowest in winter when the demand is high. In Tackling the Challenges of a Solar Community Concept in High Latitudes, Academy of Finland (AOF) project, the solutions for seasonal heat storage in high latitudes are sought.|","Underground thermal energy storage,  in situ experiment,  numerical modelling,  borehole heat exchanger"

In these areas rock mechanical aspects have to take into account already in the city planning phase when new underground facilities are introduced in the middle of existing underground infrastructure. Sometimes things can be solved with simple methods, sometimes quite extensive numerical 3D – rock mechanical analysis shall be conducted. However, the amount of data available is dictating the methods which can be used. For numerical analysis there must be enough data about the bedrock and in-situ stresses, among others. It must be kept in mind that the accuracy of the analysis is dependent on the accuracy of the initial data. In any case, rock mechanics should be utilized already in the initial design phases of underground construction. |INTRODUCTION |Rock mechanics is a relatively young science, but the basic ideas of rock mechanics have already been implicitly known to people living in caves. The basic ideas of the safety of caves are still the same as in the Stone Age. The ground type must be at least in some extent intact without any loose layers to be stable. The stability of the cave is controlled by the shape and dimensions of the cave in the condensed ground conditions. In hard rock conditions the stability of rock blocks is controlled by rock joints. |Due to the technological restrictions ancient man-made caves and tunnels have been constructed only into the ground which can be excavated by hand tools without explosives. All large caverns were created by natural processes and during ages their shapes became stable. The development in technology created possibilities to make tunnels for different purposes, but also then the design was based on experience. As the theories of statics and strength of materials developed and were applied in structural and geotechnical engineering also the mechanical behavior of the rock structures could be formulated by analytical equations. Much of this work was carried out in Central Europe where a lot of railway tunnels were constructed sometimes in difficult ground conditions. |However, the real breakthrough in rock mechanical analysis was achieved in 1970’s – 1980’s when the development of computers allowed the use of finite-element or other numerical analysis in stability calculations, first mainframe computers and then desktops and laptops. Increased calculation power of computers, advanced software and extended knowledge on rock structure, properties and in-situ stresses have enabled to make more reliable estimates on the rock mechanical effects caused by intended new projects.|","case histories, Rock mechanics,  city planning,  numerical analysis,  underground station"

If these two missions are completed and mining operations are well managed, best mining results should be achieved. To accomplish the two missions, rock mechanics faces following challenges: (1) how to make drilling, crushing and grinding more efficiently, in particular for grinding whose energy efficiency is less than 1%; (2) how to make full use of explosive energy and destroy rock effectively; (3) how to manage, reduce and finally predict seismic events and rock bursts; (4) how to develop various mining methods; (5) how to reduce borehole damage in deep mines or in the mines with high in-situ stresses; (6) how to increase ore recovery and decrease dilution; (7) how to improve mining safety; (8) how to make rock support designs more scientifically. All these challenges will be analyzed in this paper. In addition, some topics such as rock mass classification, environment protection and the effects of loading rates, temperatures, and cyclic loading on mining engineering will be discussed. |INTRODUCTION |With an increasing population over the world, the demand on various raw materials has been increased for many years. According to OECD (2015), the amount of materials extracted worldwide doubled since 1980, reaching close to 72 Gt in 2010, and is projected to reach 100 Gt by 2030. On the other hand, a huge amount of raw materials has been lost during mining operation. Taking two common minerals, iron and gold, as examples, the production of iron ore and that of gold (final product in mines) were 3378 Mt and 3020 t in the year 2014 (Brown et al, 2016), respectively. Assuming that the average ore loss in mining is 10%, and the annual production for these materials is kept constant, the annual iron loss and gold loss in the world will be 375 Mt and 336 t, respectively. Obviously, mining industry has to reduce such a huge amount of ore loss in mining production. In addition, the industry needs to improve mining safety, reduce mining cost and decrease the damage to the environment.

The primary objective of this study is to address all known causes of these productivity declines and to develop a fully coupled geomechanical/flow simulation model to simulate these production conditions. |This model mimics the effect of depletion-induced in-situ stress variations on short-term and long-term productivity by taking into account several phenomena, such as stress-dependent matrix and natural-fracture permeability as well as reduction in hydraulic-fracture conductivity caused by proppant crushing, deformation, embedment, and fracture-face creep. Matrix-permeability evolutions, considering the conflicting effects of non-Darcy flow and compaction, have also been accounted for in this model. Numerical solutions for simplified hydraulic-fracture planar geometries are then obtained by use of a finite-element-method scheme. |A synthetic case was defined to investigate the effects of each individual phenomenon on short-term and long-term production. Results show that the combined effects of permeability alterations in matrix and natural fractures as well as conductivity losses in hydraulic fractures may result in substantial cumulative-gas-production loss. The model also reproduces familiar field-observed trends, with lower long-term production corresponding to higher drawdowns. This behavior is attributed to the stress-dependent evolution of reservoir permeability and hydraulic-fracture conductivity. The results show that ignoring the effects of any of the previous phenomena results in overestimation of ultimate recovery. Furthermore, it is shown that proper management of pressure drawdown and the penalty for lower initial production rates in unconventional shale-gas reservoirs can yield substantially higher ultimate recovery. |The model is fully versatile and allows modeling and characterization of all widely differing (on a petrophysical level) shale-gas formations as well as proppant materials used for the stimulation treatments. This integrated model can be used for optimization of key parameters during the hydraulic-fracture design, for fine tuning production history matching, and especially as a predictive tool for pressure-drawdown management.|","stress-dependent, Shale Gas, Drawdown Management"

The use of superposition time adjusts for the effect of the prior rate history, and (under some conditions) shows what the transient would have looked like if the test had been performed at a constant rate. In this report, I show that if these plots are used to interpret shut-in transients from diagnostic fracture-injection tests (DFITs), the superposition-time derivative has an upward deflection that does not represent actual reservoir or transient behavior. I review mathematical properties of the superposition-time derivative. I derive equations for the pressure transient in a simplified model DFIT in which closure does not occur. I show that the onset of late-time impulse flow is controlled by injection volume and formation, wellbore, and fracture properties, not the duration of injection (as implied by the definition of superposition time). Log-log superposition-time derivative plots of DFITs exhibit a slope of 3/2 at intermediate time. However, pressure change never scales with a 3/2 power of time. One form of the G-function superficially resembles a superposition-time function constructed by summing constant-rate solutions with 3/2 power scaling. However, this is not a mathematically or physically valid interpretation. The 3/2 power arises from a spatial integration of the Carter leakoff solution. There is not a mathematical, physical, or practical justification for plotting DFIT pressure-time data in a way that creates a 3/2 slope. I conclude by providing a field example and practical recommendations for DFIT interpretation.|","Superposition time, Log-log plot, DFIT, G-function"

The paper has not been peer reviewed. |The primary objective of this study is to address all known causes of productivity declines in unconventional shale gas formations with horizontal multifractured wells and to develop |a fully coupled geomechanical/flow simulation model to simulate these production conditions. The model mimics the effect of depletion-induced in-situ stress variations on productivity by taking into account several phenomena, such as stress-dependent matrix and natural-fracture permeability and reduction in fracture conductivity because of fracture-face creep and proppant crushing, deformation, and embedment. |Model Formulation |Reservoir Matrix. The gas-storage mechanism in a shale gas reservoir is conceptually different from that of a conventional reservoir. Natural gas is adsorbed on the organic matter present in shales and, in some cases, on certain clay minerals. This adsorbed-gas layer further constricts the area for flow through the pore structure, thus reducing the effective pore radius. As the pressure in the pores reduces, gas is desorbed and the effective pore radius increases, resulting in an increase in the apparent matrix permeability. It has been suggested that desorption of methane might be partially responsible for the relatively long and flat production tails that have been observed in some shale reservoirs. |Fig. 1 shows the effects of different mechanisms on permeability evolution. Clearly, shale gas long-term performance forecasting will be affected severely if these effects are not properly considered. |Hydraulic Fractures. Hydraulic fractures are generally kept open and conductive by proppant. After exposure to confining stress for a long period of time, proppant can become deformed, causing degradation of its mechanical and physical properties. This leads to reductions in fracture width and fracture-pack permeability because of intermixing and plugging. |Additionally, the interaction between the proppant and fracture surfaces under the same confining stress can result in embedment, decreasing the fracture aperture and impairing conductivity.|","Document Type

Also, many researchers have been working on the development of various production/simulation approaches to simulate production from the complex fracture geometries. The objective of this study is to combine the fracture-propagation modeling and reservoir simulation to optimize production in shale gas reservoirs. First, we have developed a semianalytical model to simulate shale gas production from the nonplanar-fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length. The important gas-transport mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption are considered. Second, we have developed a fracture-propagation model to predict the nonplanar-fracture geometry by fully coupling elastic deformation of the rock and fluid flow. In this study, the effect of varying number of perforation clusters within a given stage ranging from two to six on the fracture propagation was investigated. Three values of stage spacing were considered including 100, 200, and 300 ft. After predicting the nonplanar-fracture geometry, the semianalytical model is used to simulate production from such fracture geometries. The effects of the number of clusters per stage for varying stage spacing on well productivity were examined. In addition, we compared the well performance with varying stage spacings of 100, 200, and 300 ft under a given lateral length of 2,500 ft. Furthermore, we coupled the fracture-propagation and semianalytical models to analyze a field well performance in a shale gas reservoir. Through the field-case study, a nonplanar-fracture geometry with a good history match was quantified. Also, the difference between the nonplanar-fracture geometry and the converted equivalent planar-fracture geometry with equal fracture length was examined. Finally, the optimal fracture-treatment design for the field well development was recommended.

A work flow including quantitative assessment of the injectivity development as a function of the operating parameters as well as the uncertain geomechanical and reservoir parameters can be used to improve the surface-facility design. |Such a work flow was applied to a shallow offshore field. The results showed that the base-case design of the facilities should be modified to avoid an increase of the flowing bottomhole pressure (BHP) above the minimum stress of the caprock. The effect of the various parameters on the BHP was investigated, and the sensitivity of the BHP to uncertain input parameters under different operating conditions was tested. The results indicated that the BHP does not exceed the BHP limit, and hence the injectivity is expected to be high enough for a sufficiently long period of time under a wide range of conditions.|","water injection, water quality, fracturing conditions, water temperature, facility design"

The massive amount of data generated presents a great opportunity for the industry to use data-analysis tools to help make informed decisions. The main challenge is the lack of the application of effective and efficient data-analysis tools to analyze and extract useful information for the decision-making process from the enormous amount of data available. In developing tight shale reservoirs, it is critical to have an optimal drilling strategy, thereby minimizing the risk of drilling in areas that would result in low-yield wells. The objective of this study is to develop an effective data-analysis tool capable of dealing with big and complicated data sets to identify hot zones in tight shale reservoirs with the potential to yield highly productive wells. The proposed tool is developed on the basis of nonparametric smoothing models, which are superior to the traditional multiple-linear-regression (MLR) models in both the predictive power and the ability to deal with nonlinear, higher-order variable interactions. This data-analysis tool is capable of handling one response variable and multiple predictor variables. To validate our tool, we used two real data sets—one with 249 tight oil horizontal wells from the Middle Bakken and the other with 2,064 shale gas horizontal wells from the Marcellus Shale. Results from the two case studies revealed that our tool not only can achieve much better predictive power than the traditional MLR models on identifying hot zones in the tight shale reservoirs but also can provide guidance on developing the optimal drilling and completion strategies (e.g., well length and depth, amount of proppant and water injected). By comparing results from the two data sets, we found that our tool can achieve model performance with the big data set (2,064 Marcellus wells) with only four predictor variables that is similar to that with the small data set (249 Bakken wells) with six predictor variables. This implies that, for big data sets, even with a limited number of available predictor variables, our tool can still be very effective in identifying hot zones that would yield highly productive wells. The data sets that we have access to in this study contain very limited completion, geological, and petrophysical information. Results from this study clearly demonstrated that the data-analysis tool is certainly powerful and flexible enough to take advantage of any additional engineering and geology data to allow the operators to gain insights on the impact of these factors on well performance.|","Nonparametric Smoothing Models, Data analysis, Big data, Unconventional oil and gas reservoirs, Multiple linear regression models"

Log-derived stress and mechanical properties that are properly calibrated with injection data provide critical descriptions of variations in different lithologies at varying depths. From a practical standpoint, however, most of the hydraulic-fracturing simulators that are currently used for treatment design use only a limited portion of a geologic-based rock-mechanical-property characterization, thus resulting in outputs that may not completely align with observed outcomes from a fracturing treatment. By use of examples from hydraulic-fracture stimulations of coals in a complex but well-characterized stress environment in Surat Basin of eastern Australia, we obtain the reservoir-rock-related input parameters that are important for the design of hydraulic fractures and also identify those that are not essential. To understand the effect on improving future fracture-stimulation designs, the authors present work flows for pressure-history matching of treatments and subsequent comparison of corresponding geometries with external measurements, such as microseismic (MS) surveys, to calibrate geomechanical models. |The paper presents examples discussing synergies, discrepancies, and gaps that currently exist between “geologic” geomechanical concepts in contrast to the geomechanical descriptions and concepts that are used and implemented in hydraulic-fracturing stimulations. Ultimately it remains paramount to constrain as many critical variables as realistically and as uniquely as possible. Significant emphasis is placed on reservoir-specific pretreatment data acquisition and post-treatment analysis. Some of the obvious differences observed between the measured and fracture-model-derived geometries are also presented in the paper, highlighting the areas in fracture modeling where significant improvement is needed. The approach presented in this paper can be used to refine hydraulic-fracture-treatment designs in similar complex reservoirs worldwide.|","Fracture Mechanics, Geomechanics, Fracture Model, Coal Bed Methane Fracturing, Surat Basin Australia"

To achieve this goal, a custom-designed experimental apparatus was constructed to conduct flow tests, founded on a high-pressure triaxial assembly. The apparatus is capable of maintaining core samples at reservoir pressure, temperature, and confining stress. We conducted several 120-day low-salinity osmotic tests in low-clay, organic-rich Eagle Ford carbonate-shale samples. Test results showed gradual, slow increase of pressure within the samples. Because this pressure behavior could not be explained properly with classical models, we formulated a mass-transport mathematical model that relies on fundamental chemical osmosis principles driving low-salinity brine into high-salinity core samples. |Our mathematical model was articulated to simulate flow into the core as a 3D porous medium rather than transport across a thin, molecule-selective membrane. The model is dependent on the following principles: The low-salinity brine selectively enters the pores by diffusion mass transport, and the pre-existing, ionized dissolved salt molecules within the core are restrained by internal electrostatic forces to counterdiffuse in the direction opposite to that of the low-salinity-brine molecules entering the pore network. Critical model input data, such as permeability, porosity, and rock compressibility, were obtained from flow experiments on twin cores, and the diffusion coefficient was chosen by history matching. The strengths of the numerical simulation include reliance on mass-transport fundamental principles; not requiring the use of an ambiguously defined membrane-efficiency term; and relying on chemical-potential gradient as the driving force for the low-salinity brine to enter the high-salinity core, generating osmotic pressure within the pore network. The latter implies that osmotic pressure is the consequence of water entering the cores, not the cause. Results of this research have provided a more plausible explanation of pore-scale mass transport in organic-rich shales, and provide useful insights for design of effective enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) processes.|","membrane efficiency, shale, osmotic pressure, rock fluid interactions, diffusion"

One aspect of fractured reservoirs is that not all have fully interconnected fracture networks. Most of the fractured reservoirs are only partially fractured. Partially fractured reservoirs, in contrast, consists of discrete bundles of conductive fractures and/or isolated fractures. The discrete-fracture bundles are interconnected within but are isolated from other bundles nearby. In case of partially fractured reservoirs, location, size and shape of discrete-fracture bundles must be determined in order to populate the fracture grid of dual-porosity or dual-porosity/dual-permeability simulation model. |The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how the location, size, and shape of interconnected-conductive-fracture bundles can be determined by integrating borehole-image data with depletion-curve analysis. The method was devised to populate a fracture grid of a preliminary dual-porosity simulation model for a small Field in the Middle East.

Fracture porosity, permeability, and size of matrix block bounded by fractures within each fracture bundle can be calculated by use of fracture data from borehole-image logs.

In addition to the creation of hydraulic fractures, hydraulic-fracturing treatment can also reopen existing natural fractures, which can create a complex-fracture network. The area that is covered by the fracture network is usually termed the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), and the spatial extent and properties of the SRV are crucial for shale-gas-production behavior. In this work, we propose a method for history matching of the SRV of shale-gas reservoirs using production data. For each hydraulic-fracturing stage, the fracture network is parameterized with one major fracture of the hydraulic fractures and the SRV that represents minor hydraulic fractures and reopened natural fractures. The major fracture is modeled explicitly, whereas the SRV is modeled by the dual-permeability/dual-porosity (DP/DP) model. Moreover, the spatial extent of the SRV is parameterized by the level-set-function values on a predefined representing-node system. After parameterization, an iterative ensemble smoother is used to perform history matching. Both single-stage-fracturing cases and multistage-fracturing cases are set up to test the performance of the proposed method. Numerical results demonstrate that by use of the proposed method, the SRV can be well-recognized by assimilating production data.|","stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), hydraulic fracturing, level set function, history matching, iterative ensemble smoother"

In this work, the concept of effective wormhole coverage is proposed as a proxy of the drainage region of CHOPS wells with complex wormhole networks. The wormhole intensity is defined as the total length of wormholes per unit effective wormhole coverage. A CHOPS flow model is developed by use of the boundary-element method (BEM) to account for various boundary conditions, wormhole morphologies, and effects of wormhole dynamic growth. Transient pressure and rate responses calculated by the model are validated by comparing with analytical solutions and numerical simulations. Modeling results show that the effective wormhole coverage and wormhole intensity within the region dominantly affect the characteristics of pressure and rate/time behaviors, regardless of the detailed wormhole morphologies. Accordingly, dimensionless pressure and rate type curves are developed to match flow behaviors, such as wormhole linear- and transitional-flow regimes to estimate effective wormhole coverage of CHOPS wells with available field data. This work extends the literature with fast type-curve matching of pressure and rate/time behaviors instead of generally practiced numerical-simulation routines.

Accompanying the downturn, the oil and gas industry has entered a new era of digitalization, introducing new buzzwords to our industry such as artificial intelligence, digital twin, machine learning, neural network, industrial Internet of Things, and cloud computing, just to name a few. The industry has already begun its transition, going from more-traditional mechanized systems in the hands of humans to more-computer-controlled drilling systems that will eventually lead to full drilling automation. |If it has been proved in the past that innovative technology is excellent for bringing more-efficient solutions to reduce costs, will digital technology be the panacea for the whole industry? While some segments of the drilling and completion industry could logically and more easily benefit from it, some others require great caution and expertise to leverage digital technology in its many forms and levels of complexity. Being able to digest, filter, and analyze a huge amount of data in real time to provide useful and readable indicators and plots for drilling engineers is fantastic and within reasonable reach, because it obviously facilitates the tasks of drilling engineers dealing with real-time data entry. Machine learning, on the other hand, such as neural networks is not new just for the drilling industry but has re-emerged recently with the growth of big data and requires data-science process skills to implement various algorithms properly. Complex, non-linear, and multiphysics phenomena that involve many parameters and are difficult to measure directly, such as stuck-pipe events, washout, fatigue, wear, and maintenance of equipment, can be tackled through machine learning with relative success as long as the training set of data is sufficient and representative of all possible situations. |However, machine learning or artificial intelligence should not necessarily be seen as a magic tool applicable to any engineering problem, many of which can still be treated with more-traditional physical models that are more-easily understood by engineers. Even though engineering is still undertaken mostly with traditional and deterministic models, it is highly plausible that this digital transformation will redefine the traditional drilling-engineering job in the near future. An increasing number of traditional tasks will be handled by computers (e.g., data analytics, simulations/modeling), but one must keep in mind that decision making will still require engineers able to understand the fundamental principles of the problem fully. Coupling physical models with machine-learning techniques smartly is probably something to explore. Last, but not least, I think that millennials, digital natives, will have a big role to play in this transformation because they are more prone to adapt naturally to the technology they have always been living with. |Recommended additional reading at OnePetro: www.onepetro.org. |SPE 181788 Optimizing the Multistage Fracturing Interval for Horizontal Wells in Bakken and Three Forks Formations by Kegang Ling, University of North Dakota, et al. |SPE 183125 Application of Real-Time Geomechanics on a Horizontal Well by Osman Hamid, Saudi Aramco, et al. |SPE 184875 Evaluating Stresses Along Horizontal Wells in Unconventional Plays by Marisela Sanchez-Nagel, OilField Geomechanics, et al.|",""

Fields with complex geology add another set of challenges due to the higher uncertainty on formation dips, fractured or weak formation to name a few. The most unstable zones in the well construction process are thinly bedded shales. Their laminated nature creates variations in rock strength between the different layers making them very susceptible to rock failure. Unfortunately, these formations are very common and can occur at any stage of the well construction. |Traditionally, a one dimensional (1D) geomechanical pre-drill model is prepared using offset data (conventional triple combo with sonic data) and is used for mud weight calibration and to prepare the appropriate action plan to be implemented during the drilling of the well. While drilling, real-time triple combo, and acoustic data are acquired, refining the 1D geomechanical model, reducing the uncertainty with each newly acquired data point, enabling safer drilling. |The new workflow adds another crucial component: Rock strength characterization. Rock strength comprises the Unconfined Compressive Strength, the Tensile Strength, and the Friction Angle. These factors are critical to estimating the shear failure during wellbore stability analysis.

The crossover of the dipole dispersion curves indicates the presence of differential stresses around the wellbore. Fast and slow shear slownesses are split at low frequencies and determined by the far-field stresses. On the other hand, it is known that the depth of investigation at sonic frequencies is relatively far from where the largest variation of the stress-induced anisotropic formation slownesses exists which is near wellbore area. |As an alternative approach, this paper presents the importance of the ultrasonic azimuthal slowness measurements (microsonic) for characterizing stress effects in boreholes. The abilities of such measurements are numerically evaluated by simulating elastic waves propagating in formations subjected to triaxial stresses. Taking advantage of the short wavelength, the ultrasonic measurement is found to be highly sensitive to formation properties at shallow distances from the borehole wall and suitable for mapping stress-induced variations of compressional and shear slownesses around the wellbore. These slownesses are evaluated from simulated waveforms as a function of the azimuth around the borehole using a semblance processing algorithm. |Introduction  |Knowledge of tectonic stresses is required for key oilfield operations including well planning, drilling, wellbore stability analysis and enhanced production.

Cold water injection creates a cooled rock region around the well that can reduce the horizontal stresses acting on the reservoir and, also, the injection pressure to initiate and propagate a fracture. However, the impact of thermal stresses in saline caprocks, where creeping occurs, is not well understood yet. This study aims at modeling the cooled region created by cold water injection and evaluate the thermally induced stresses in both reservoir and saline caprock. 
In order to assess the evolution of the pressure and temperature in the reservoir and in the caprock during 16 years of cold water injection, reservoir simulations considering thermal effects were carried out. Various simulations were performed using different water injection rates and different thermal diffusivities for the reservoir and for the caprock. The model used in these thermal simulations comprehended not only the pre-salt carbonate reservoir, but also the salt rocks. Stress and strain were evaluated using a 3D finite element in a one-way coupling scheme, including the reservoir, overburden (salt and post-salt), sideburden and underburden. 
In the worst simulated case, after 16 years of cold water injection, the height of the cooled region in the salt was about 200 m above the top of the reservoir. As expected, horizontal stresses in the reservoir significantly decreased with cooling. On the other hand, horizontal stresses in the saline caprock did not change significantly, even though the thermal expansion coefficient of salt rocks is five times greater than that of carbonates. This result suggests that creeping in the salt relieves thermal stress induced by cooling. Thus, saline caprock integrity is not influenced by cold fluid injection in the reservoir, as long as salt creeping can be considered. 
Although cold fluid injection may cool the salt, stress state in the caprock remains unaltered. Thermal stress is relieved by the salt creeping at the expense of plastic deformations. Thus, the saline caprock integrity is not impacted by cold fluid injection.|","Reservoir Geomechanics, Cold Fluid Injection, Caprock Integrity, Presalt Reservoir, Thermal Simulation"

Geomechanical models need to incorporate a more reliable geological model concerning the overburden as well as the underburden sections. These aspects are more important when considering the flow simulation model and the injection and/or production of the field due to the surrounding rocks behavior and their responses against those ratios (injection/producing). 
Therefore, a 3D model is needed and the oil industry faces a great challenge: how to build this reliable model without seismic information? Or, how to use seismic properties with all their ambiguity to derive this 3D model? 
Special attention is necessary when observing the salt-section above the pre-salt reservoir in Santos Basin, Brazil, since the amplitude response is heavily influenced by the velocity model used for the migration process. 
The majority of these velocity models are considered non-geological as the main reasoning for them is only to produce a good image. To build a good seismic image, reproducing the geology is not needed: the only condition imposed on the model is that the migration operators applied using that model will focus the image. In other words, we could see a completely alien model regarding geology that focuses the image, and that model would be considered correct. 
In this paper, we will illustrate a way to build plausive velocity models fitting both the geology and the mathematics of the migration for a good seismic image. This allows for the use of the amplitude response for many purposes, including (but not limited to) deriving geomechanical properties, predicting the lithologies inside the evaporitic section and recursively building a new, more realistic velocity model.|","Salt Characterization, Seismic Inversion, Seismic Facies, Geomechanics, Velocity Modelling"

Near-borehole stress analysis is performed from an integrated interpretation of sonic, imaging, and caliper tools to determine the magnitude and orientation of stresses around the borehole. These stresses can affect the wellbore stability because the tectonic stress field is disturbed during the well drilling. This paper presents a case study in which integrated information from borehole acoustic logs, image logs, and caliper tools were used to identify stresses in the near-borehole region of a deepwater presalt formation, offshore Brazil. The objectives were to extract the maximum (SH) and minimum stress (Sh) orientations in the near-borehole region for a particular zone of interest and identify fractures due to tectonic stresses. 
The Sh orientation was determined by the presence of induced fractures and borehole breakouts (both created during drilling), which were observed in the ultrasonic and resistive imaging log data. The SH orientation can be characterized using cross-dipole sonic anisotropy processing when borehole conditions are favorable. Tectonic fractures were identified using ultrasonic and resistive imaging log data information and the Stoneley reflection method was used to support the conductivity interpretation from these image logs.|","Stress identification, Carbonates, Cross Dipole Sonic, Deep Water, Fractures"

In many cases, the intensity of tide signal present in a pressure transient test is so strong as to render its interpretation unfeasible. This noise (from tide) to signal (from reservoir) ratio is a function of the transfer of tidal stresses to porous pressure as well as of some parameters from a downhole pressure test, specially, the flow rate before shut-in, formation transmissibility, shut-in elapsed time and indirectly, the wellbore skin factor. 
The purpose of this work is to disseminate a predictive method of tidal effect simulation based on TMD, Tide Model Driver, with the necessary procedures and adjustments, which allows the extraction of the tidal signal components from the pressure signal recorded in wells under test through downhole pressure gauges, thus allowing analysis of test data under intense tide signal interference. 
Furthermore, this work establishes a relationship between Bourdet derivative smoothing parameter L and the Nyquist Sampling Theorem. This relationship acts as a criterion on the choice of maximum L, limited by Nyquist Theorem and is designed to preserve derivative tide signal shape and amplitude for the Bourdet well test analysis method, not allowing its misinterpretation as reservoir behavior. In addition, this work present simple relationships or even a full tide simulator to predict tidal effects on pressure buidup or falloff and logarithmic derivative, considering the actual or estimated time of test, contributing thus to well test design as well. 
The installation of PDGs, Permanent Downhole Gauges (pressure and temperature piezo-electric sensors), in wells completed with ICVs, Intelligent Completion Valves and designed to perform extended well tests, or EWTs, has made it possible to recover characteristic tide pressure signals from relatively long periods of pressure record. In some cases, it has become possible to detach the tide signal in order to characterize it, through the Discrete Fourier Transform, DFT, determining the main tide frequency components present therein. The comparison of those frequency constituents with the ones present in oceanic and earth tide signals led to the use of a tide simulator, TMD MatLab Toolbox, as a tidal effect filter with excellent results, without the need of time lag adjustments. 
The tidal effect present in pressure data from PDGs installed at oilfield wells always comes together with reservoir signal. A simple method to recover an almost pure tidal signal was developed, consisting of a polynomial fit to represent the reservoir signal. The recovered tide signal was then submitted to Discrete Fourier analysis, DFT, and the resulting frequency components were compared with oceanic and coastal tidal data available through tide stations, and later on, compared also with simulated tidal predictions, leading to the use of a tide predictor as a tidal filter. With this result from DFT, a tide signal generator, the TMD software, was selected with excellent results. A non-linear regression is run over the recovered tide data, to adjust the amplitude level of tide signal transmited to the reservoir pore pressure by rock stress. The procedure for using the TMD and necessary adjustments to conform and extract the tide signal is illustrated by a field case with strong tidal effect, to the point of totally spoiling the characteristic transmissibility levels of the pressure derivative on pressure shut-ins. On the other hand, after the proper treatment through the proposed filter, the reservoir ""tide-free"" signal is recovered, turning possible the analysis of the data with increased sensibility. Once the filter is adjusted to pressure data from one well, it is ready for use on other wells operating at the same field and reservoir.|","Tide, Tidal Signal, Well Test Analysis, L Derivative Parameter, Tidal Filter"

Drilling horizontal wells in shallow and poorly consolidated reservoirs in deepwater scenarios involves risky operations due to the narrow mud weight window. Risks include severe drilling fluid losses, wellbore instability, and fault reactivation, which, in the worst case, may connect reservoir to the sea floor. 
This work presents a case study of risk reduction based on geomechanics, which includes concepts of fault reactivation while drilling, permitted plastified area around the wellbore, and fit-for-purpose data acquisition, which allowed a recalibration of the model and timely changes on the drilling plan. 
The study started with a full 3D geomechanical characterization, which is an advanced way to determine stress distribution in a field, in particular, along the faults. Based on this study, it was possible to locate and avoid zones of higher risks of losses and fault reactivation, mitigating drilling risks. 
From the study, it was also possible to identify the main uncertainties of the model, which allowed a fit-for-purpose data acquisition plan. The most important missing information was a calibration point for the minimal horizontal stress in the reservoir. Previous drilling experience in the area and geomechanics modelling were not conclusive about losses mechanisms, and the upper limits for horizontal drilling were also not clear. In addition, borehole instability had been shown to be an issue on offset wells; therefore, lower limits for drilling were unclear too. 
It was decided to drill a pilot hole down to the reservoir, set a packer in the caprock and perform a series of minifrac tests. The measured minimal horizontal stress in the reservoir was revealed to be lower than initially expected, which implied the need to recalibrate the model and make important adjustments to the drilling plan. The model was recalibrated and the safe mud weight window was found to be even narrower. It was identified that a lower and unprecedented mud weight had to be used in the horizontal section, which was an additional risk. To evaluate this risk, the concept of permitted plastified area around the wellbore was used, and a lower mud weight was selected under a risk analysis manner. 
Based on the study, drilling risks were mitigated and horizontal drilling was performed successfully, with minimal losses and controlled wellbore collapse.|","Drilling, Deepwater, Fluid Losses, Geomechanics, Minifrac"

In this study, a wellbore stability model was built of the pre-salt area using analytical correlations to obtain an optimum mud window. The operational window assists in optimizing the fluid weight to be used while drilling and is defined by a lower limit (pore or collapse pressure) and an upper limit (fracture gradient). To build a geomechanical model, it is necessary to estimate different parameters. Log data from offset wells, pressure measurements, formation integrity tests, and data from the World Stress Map were used to estimate overburden, pore pressure, rock strength, the magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress, and the magnitude and direction of the maximum horizontal stress. These parameters made it possible to estimate the collapse gradient and define the mud window. The sensitivity analysis of the parameters was performed on the rock strength (UCS) and maximum horizontal stress due to the lack of available data, especially borehole images, 4 to 6 arm caliper, and triaxial tests. The geomechanical model indicates that the overburden in the carbonates of the studied area ranges from 14.0 to 14.6 lb/gal. Pore pressure indicates two different behaviors, presenting slightly over-pressurized (approximately 9.4lb/gal) and over-pressurized in another area (13.2lb/gal). The results of the formation integrity test (leak-off tests) were used to estimate the minimum effective stress ratio (ESRmin), a constant value around 0.65 with a minimum horizontal stress values between 12.4 to 12.6lb/gal in the slightly over-pressured zone and in the over-pressured zone the values are between 13.8 to 13.9lb/gal. The average value of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) was estimated at approximately 43MPa. The azimuth of maximum horizontal stress was estimated to be approximately 95° and was obtained from the World Stress Map. The effective maximum horizontal stress ratio (ESRmax) was between 0.95 and 1.45, according to the presented scenarios, and the conclusion was that the faulting stress regime was between normal and strike-slip. For the mud window calculation, the effects of slightly over-pressured pore pressure (Pp) and the selected failure criterion, elastic properties and allowable breakouts provided a lower bound limit to the mud window in the carbonates of between 10.0 to 10.1lb/gal and an upper bound limit between 12.4 to 12.6lb/gal for the study area. In the zone with the high-pore pressure gradient, the geomechanical model provided a lower bound limit between 13.3 to 13.4lb/gal and an upper bound limit between 13.8 to 13.9lb/gal.|","Wellbore Stability, Pre-salt, Geomechanical model, Carbonates"

This thesis presents the results of a study evaluating the application of high powered lasers when perforating cement-lined wells in carbonate rock reservoirs. The focus is on the creation of lateral channels in the walls of the well to allow the flow of the oil into the well. Through an intensive literature review of the international patents published in the last decade, the current state-of-the-art use of lasers in the perforation of rocks was evaluated. Specifically, 226 patent documents were found to have been published since 2008, showing the great importance of lasertechnology in this field. The results of the microtomography analysis are presented, showing samples of the cement slurry formulation used in pre-salt wells and carbonate rocks with characteristics close to the ones found in these types of reservoirs. The fiber laserutilized presented an output of up to 1.5kW and a wavelength of 1,064µm. To evaluate the structure of the samples, X-ray tomography and microtomography were employed. The specific energy was estimated at 243 J/mm3 for the carbonate rocks. The final tests to represent the well architecture were realized with samples of liner/cement/carbonate. By means of lasers with the power of 1.5kW for 80 seconds, channels with 5mm diameters and 50mm depths were produced. The results obtained show, although only preliminarily, the potential of using this technology in perforation operations.|","Stimulation, carbonate rock, perforation, Scale removal, laser"

We conducted ten cylindrical specimens (4 mm diameter and 8 mm height) with bedding plane inclined at 0° and 90° to the axial loading direction, respectively. The results show typical brittle fracture characteristic and heterogeneity of mineral composition of the miniature shale specimens. The average value of UCS of specimens at 0° is little lower than those of specimens at 90°, while average elastic modulus (E) at 0° is slightly higher than the latter. Based on reconstructed three-dimensional CT images threshold segmentation of cracks, cracks occur earlier in specimen at 0°, mainly in the form of tensile splitting parallel with axial loading direction, while shear sliding oriented at an angle of about 65~75° to the horizontal direction dominated in the specimens at 90°. Besides, according to scanning electron microscopy(SEM) observation of microstructure characteristics, it is demonstrated that the fractured bedding plane appear to be more flat and smooth than the cross section. The failure mechanisms at 0° is more prone to be intergranular fracture along the weak consolidation, while transgranular fracture is the main attribution of failure at 90°. Moreover, box-counting dimension(BCD) calculations on processed three-dimension images of cracks also proved a larger degree of complexity and roughness at 90°.

The model shows that the relative stage sequencing relative to the direction of fault slip can significantly impact the fault slip. Changing the viscosity of the fracturing fluid is also explored as an operational mitigation scenario, which is found to have a strong impact on fault slip and associated seismic magnitudes.

The oil and gas industry typically uses a poroelastic model to estimate horizontal stresses. This model requires knowledge of poroelastic properties, the vertical or overburden stress, pore pressure, and the two horizontal elastic principal strains (assuming one principal strain is vertical). Usually some of these parameters are poorly known; most workers make simplifying assumptions about the poroelastic properties and about the horizontal elastic strains. Typical simplifying assumptions are (a) one or both of the horizontal strains are assumed to be zero, and (b) the two independent Biot-Willis effective stress coefficients are assumed to be 1 or, if less than 1, they are assumed to be equal. To test these assumptions, we used extensive laboratory and field measurements to constrain the poroelastic model for the Middle Bakken reservoir in North Dakota. We measured the relevant poroelastic properties on core plugs and found that the Biot-Willis effective stress coefficients were less than 0.8, with significantly different horizontal and vertical components. In conjunction with previously measured in-situ stresses, these properties imply that the horizontal elastic strains are on the order of 10<U+2212>4 or greater. These strains imply a difference of 103 psi (7 MPa) or more between the actual and the computed minimum horizontal stress that assumes zero horizontal strain. This difference is quite significant in the context of hydraulic fracturing and demonstrates that the common assumptions about strain and effective stress coefficients are incorrect for the Middle Bakken. This study is an initial step toward understanding the variations in lateral strain across the area of interest.

The probability distribution of the geophysical properties of interest can be computed using a probabilistic inverse method. The integration of stochastic inverse methods and geophysical modeling allows generating multiple reservoir models of rock and fluid properties that honor the geophysical measurements. Stochastic approaches allow sampling multiple solutions from the posterior distribution of the model parameters and quantifying the uncertainty in the model parameter predictions. Stochastic inversion algorithms can be applied to seismic inversion problems as well as petrophysical inversion problems.

Satellite surface deformation data acquired over the Umm Gudair field from 2003 onwards, using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data has revealed the existence of ground subsidence over the field. In this work, a geomechanical inverse modelling technique was employed to quantitatively relate observed surface subsidence with its subsurface source mechanisms, in particular, pore pressure changes from the Minagish Oolite reservoir. By discretizing the reservoir into hydro-mechanical units, we generate a set of numerically-derived forward operators mapping the effects of pore pressure changes to subsurface deformation and ultimately surface subsidence. These operators were generated using a 3D geomechanical model capturing structural and stratigraphic complexities of the underlying physical problem. In analysing the inverted pressure change patterns in light of reservoir geology and actual field production experience, our work showcases the use of observed InSAR surface subsidence during field development and the potential applications to monitor reservoir behaviour, drainage patterns and aquifer activity.

Considering the shale characteristics of the excellent stratification, the well-developed cracks or fractures and the small-scale pores, an effective or suitable shale anisotropic rock-physics model contributes to achieve the accurate prediction of effective geostress parameters in shale-gas reservoirs. In this paper, we firstly built a shale anisotropic rock-physics model with orthorhombic symmetry, which helps to calculate the anisotropic and geomechanical parameters under the orthorhombic assumption. Then, we introduced an anisotropic stress model with orthorhombic symmetry compared with an isotropic stress model and a transversely isotropic stress model. Combining the effective estimation of the pore pressure and the vertical stress parameters, we finally obtained the effective geostress parameters including the minimum and maximum horizontal stress parameters, providing a useful guide for the exploration and development in shale-gas reservoirs. Of course, the ultimately optimal choice of hydraulic-fracturing area may also take consideration into other multi-factors such as the rock brittleness, the cracks or fractures, and the hydrocarbon distribution.

In contrast to the previous works concentrated mainly on the fluid injection, we consider these parameters for both, injection- and production induced seismicity. We show how to estimate the maximum induced magnitude and demonstrate this for several case studies. Various case studies show that similarly to the tectonic seismicity, statistics of the fluid-injection and production-induced seismicity can be rather well described by the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude distribution. The model of point-like independent seismic events describes well the statistics of numerous small-magnitude earthquakes. This model allows to formulate a simple description of the seismicity rate and to introduce parameters quantifying the seismo-tectonic state of a fluid-injection site. One of the main parameters is the seismogenic index. However, large-magnitude events deviate from the Gutenberg-Richter statistic. The finiteness of rupture surfaces of such earthquakes plays an important role and must be taken into account. We propose several models describing injection and production-induced seismicity. The most general model (3) takes explicitly features of the large-magnitude statistic into account.

Despite this potential and the advantages it presents over conventional geophone arrays, challenges remain regarding geometrical sensitivity and noise-floors. Furthermore, there has been little application of DAS systems at Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) injection sites. Here, we present the results of hammer blow field experiments, in subzero conditions using a single cable DAS recording setup. We test different data processing routines and compute Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs) in the time and frequency domains. We find that most energy is observed in the 20-600 Hz band and that SNR ratios are approximately half those of geophones, which record simultaneously. An STA/LTA automated trigger detection routine performs well for the majority of the DAS recording channels but with some detections not defining the expected hyperbolic move-out with distance for common arrivals. These likely represent later, secondary arrival phases, possibly reflections from the frozen-unfrozen ground interface. Despite this, using a single homogenous velocity model it is possible to locate the hammer blows to within 3.9 m of their actual locations. These encouraging initial results will be used to tailor the setup and acquisition parameters in further field and laboratory tests. This will ultimately lead to the pre-injection site characterization and subsequent microseismic monitoring of active CCS sites in the future.

J., Northeast Natural Energy LLC| Costello, Ian, Northeast Natural Energy LLC","|Horizontal drilling in organic-shale reservoirs is a preferred way to commercially produce hydrocarbons. However, optimal placement of fracturing stages and perforation clusters along the lateral producer well is compromised by a lack of resolution in the stresses and mechanical property logs that would capture the presence of shale heterogeneities. This paper describes a new approach to a geomechanical analysis along a lateral that would reflect the presence of heterogeneities based on the axial resolution of the sonic tool. A geomechanical analysis of organic-shale formation provides estimates of differences between the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses and anisotropic mechanical properties as a function of horizontal measured depth. This analysis is based on inverting cross-dipole dispersions from sonic data acquired along a lateral for a subset of orthorhombic constants. Formations with large differences in the principal stresses support deep hydraulic fractures in a plane perpendicular to the minimum principal stress, whereas nearly isotropic stresses cause short and diffused fractures. In addition, rock fracturability depends on anisotropic mechanical properties in terms of Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios. Both the anisotropic stresses and mechanical properties contribute to the presence of conducting fractures that contribute to the hydrocarbon productivity. These two independent characteristics of the formation are not always in harmony with each other. Consequently, this paper describes our study to identify intervals with higher productivity based on a cluster score log from fiber-optic data together with a production log, and correlating those intervals with the observed stress anisotropy and mechanical properties in terms of larger Young’s moduli and lower Poisson’s ratios.

A discontinuous Galerkin method with penalty flux is utilized for discretization in space, and the rate- and state-dependent friction is taken into account in the form of a nonlinear transmitting boundary condition, which is weakly enforced across the fault surface as numerical flux. An iterative coupling scheme is developed to overcome the challenge of implicit time stepping, by splitting the state ODE, which is defined only on the rupture surface and solved by a high-order Runge–Kutta method with finer time stepping, from the linear elastic system which is defined on the 3D subdomains and solved using a standard time marching scheme. The coupling of the two parts is set up as a constrained optimization problem based on the force equilibrium, and solved by Newton–type methods.

Consequently, developing efficient carbon capture and sequestration strategies to mitigate global warming is of great practical significance. The presence and orientation of fractures within a reservoir and its seal governs the long-term effectiveness of carbon dioxide storage. Fractures within a formation result from in-situ stress distributions and are characterized by an anisotropic behavior on the observed seismic responses. Wireline data provide information about factures at the well location, but away from the well one must rely on the seismic data. This work analyzed P-wave multiazimuth seismic data from a potential carbon sequestration site, located at the Rock Springs Uplift in Wyoming, USA. Using prestack waveform inversion, accurate azimuthal velocities were obtained for offset-to-angle transformation and to compute azimuthal angle gathers. These angle gathers were then stacked for each azimuth and analyzed for azimuthal anisotropy to estimate the fracture orientation and relative fracture density. Finally, the results of the seismic azimuthal analysis were corroborated with the well information and core data, demonstrating that the proposed work is effective in estimating the fracture orientation and relative fracture density from the P-wave seismic data.

It is important to understand the controls affecting pore-scale fluid flow. Complex tight microporous systems, as encountered in Middle Jurassic siliciclastic reservoirs of this study, render permeability prediction from logs challenging and result in a poor match with conventional core analysis (CCAL). Pore-scale permeability controls need to be addressed as part of the pre-testing petrophysical analysis, but not post-evaluation to be of value in exploration drilling. |The objective of this study is to improve the permeability model for the Middle Jurassic succession in a representative well (termed “well A”). A proper evaluation of the pore structure porosity types and hydraulic tortuosity leads to better permeability estimates by adding constraints to the permeability model. X-ray micro CT-scan technology provides 3D high resolution images (2-5 microns) that resolve the 3D pore structure in rocks and enables us to quantify porosity and hydraulic tortuosity. Based in the comparison of six permeability models, the Kozeny-Carman model, which uses porosity, average grain size and hydraulic tortuosity to estimate permeability, proved to provide the most accurate petrophysical analysis. Modeling results show good agreement with well tests that indicate a tight formation, contrary to conventional core analysis that yielded permeability values an order of magnitude higher than permeability logs. Other data from thin section analyses and mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) pore throat distributions support the modeling results. |This study emphasizes the application of micro CT-scan technology in formation evaluation and the estimation of petrophysical input parameters for accurate permeability prediction in a timely and cost-effective manner. |Presentation Date: Wednesday, September 27, 2017 |Start Time: 2:15 PM |Location: Exhibit Hall C, E-P Station 4 |Presentation Type: EPOSTER|","Porosity, 3D, Rock physics, High-resolution, Permeability"

A forward modelling approach, where the true earth model is known, helps to unravel the time-lapse seismic response due to the complex interactions of porosity, change in partial fluid saturations and fluid compressibilities, change in pore pressure and the resulting compaction or dilation. Specifically, we use vertical strain in computing a change in effective stress to estimate velocity changes. The results show that the proportionality constant (a.k.a. the R-factor) between vertical strain and fractional velocity change is nearly constant over a wide range of porosity values, a behavior that is also observed in field-data. This study thus improves the rock-physics foundation of the observed behavior. Whereas porosity has a negligible impact on the R-factor, it has a marked impact on the change in P-wave velocity due to fluid effects. Gas ex-solution during pressure depletion can thus result in a velocity slowdown at high porosity, or in a velocity speed-up at low porosity. Interpretation of S-wave velocity changes helps avoid ambiguity between fluid effects and geomechanical effects.

A case study from the lower Paleozoic shales in northern Poland.","Mulinska, Marta, Polish Academy of Sciences| Malinowski, Michal, Polish Academy of Sciences| Cyz, Marta, Polish Academy of Sciences","|Here, we apply a workflow that allows us to differentiate brittle and ductile rocks of the Lower Paleozoic shale play in Northern Poland (Baltic Basin) using surface seismic data. We start from the brittleness evaluation using well logs by applying both: 1) rock-elastic and 2) mineral content-based methods. As the well log based brittleness gives us information only near the borehole, we estimate brittleness of the reservoir in three dimensions at seismic scale by integrating well logs and set of rock-elastic property volumes that are calculated based on the simultaneous AVO inversion results. For elastic seismic brittleness estimation we apply the combination of Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus, whereas for mineral content-based brittleness we use a proximal support vector machine algorithm (PSVM). Because of the small thickness of the target intervals (< 25 m) as well as low resolution of the input data, we are not able to obtain satisfactory results in case of the seismic elastic-based brittleness calculations. Therefore, we calculate the seismic mineral-based brittleness by applying an alternative approach – supervised learning classification algorithm – to achieve better results. The main problem with this method is related to the limited number of available wells to train the algorithm and validate it, as well as the classification itself. Despite this fact, the mineral brittleness predicted from seismic using PSVM, shows more details of the target formations as compared to the mechanical one. We have a strong belief that in the case of thin shale reservoir as well as low resolution of the input seismic data, the PSVM is a preferred solution to predict volumetric brittleness.

These measurement protocols differ due to the number of reference chambers and the pressure boundary conditions applied. We include the effect of gas slippage (Klinkenberg corrections), pressure dependent density, and neglect the effects of pressure dependent viscosity and rock compressibility. Over the pressure ranges we model these effects are assumed to be minor. Forchheimer terms are also assumed negligible due to the low flow rates encountered. 
Significant pressure drops must be used to obtain large enough flow rates to perform the measurements. This implies significant pressure dependent density effects. In contrast, gas slippage increases the transport of gas by an amount depending on the mean pressure in the sample. Nearly identical fits are obtained for any value of permeability by varying the magnitude of the gas slippage effect. In order to separate these two effects, measurements must be made at distinctly different mean pressures. The different effects of the nonlinearities on the measured chamber pressures are presented for each of the measurement protocols. 
The overall results indicate that plug scale measurements are practical. Typical measurement times are on the order of days and grinding of the samples is therefore not necessary. We recommend using unsteady state measurements at reservoir stress, supplemented with sinusoidal pressure and pulse decay to calibrate the nonlinear effects, the impact of diffusion, adsorption and absorption.

We developed a new workflow for deriving effective stress/pore pressure from seismic velocities. The new method is based on iterative looping between basin modeling and seismic imaging. Each iteration consists of data extraction from areas where seismic quality and quality of basin model results meet pre-defined quality criteria (e.g., fit to calibration data, gather flatness, continuity and focus) and establishing new effective stress / velocity transform functions. This process is repeated until good fit to well calibration data is achieved (pressure and velocity), and the quality of the seismic image is satisfactory. Test results indicate that in addition to simultaneous improvement of pore pressure estimates and seismic image, the workflow leads to defining more robust seismic velocity / pore pressure transform functions that can be used away from well control and in analog areas.

These perspectives effectively summarize the potential technical utility to industry, namely, the aspirations for S-waves data use. Typically, they cover borehole and surface seismic profiles to capture the R&D plus commercial impact. In addition, these perspectives cite case-study results to demonstrate the “S-wave application”. Winterstein’s (1987) perspective summarizes S-wave objectives as: |Amplitude effects to qualify reservoir “bright spots”. |Vp/Vs: to characterize lithology, porosity or fractures. |Reservoir images in poor P-seismic areas. |Subsurface higher resolution than with P-wave data. |Anisotropy to investigate fracturing or lithology. |These points provide a convenient structure to update. This perspective starts ~1977 with the Conoco Group Shoot targeting the commercial applications of S-wave vibrators. Following, ~1987 a more vector-wavefield approach arose around nine-component (9C) recordings, such as in the ARCO Multicomponent Group Shoot (Tatham and McCormack, 1991). With the industry downturn, the S-wave investigations shifted to consortia and offshore. Successful applications of 4C on-bottom recordings ~1997 enabled imaging of marine converted-waves. The P-S image overcame the lack of P-wave seismic response at reservoirs with Class 2 AVO and under gas clouds. Since then, production monitoring, heavy oil, geomechanics and shale reservoirs needs have looked to converted-waves to improve on P-wave images and estimates of subsurface properties (Gaiser and Strudley, 2005). |The literature shares numerous trials, pilots and experiments attempting to apply S-wave technology. However, if ‘repeat business’ is a measure of the success of commercial application, there appears to be limited uptake in S-waves. One positive example comes from heavy oil-sands operators in Canada, where P-S data use alongside P-data assists with mapping reservoir detail and production monitoring (Weston Bellman 2012, 2014). Discussions in historical numerous trials demonstrate, or suggest, barriers to successful application of S-waves (Bale et al., 2009). These barriers include variability in near-surface/overburden properties, complexity of S-wave propagation including anisotropy, and the ability to incorporate S-wave with P-wave data analysis. Where the S-wave application is unsuccessful, these barriers often combine to limit signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), image resolution or detection sensitivity.|",",  p-wave, shear wave,  borehole geophysics, anisotropy"

From pore compressibility measurement, the static pore stiffness and bulk modulus can be determined. Previous studies on the relation between dynamic and static moduli are often based on the tri-axial testing of dry samples. The tri-axial testing may introduced stress induced anisotropy effect that interfere study of the relation between the dynamic and static moduli. Based on traditional ultrasonic measurement under hydrostatic stress, relation between dynamic and static bulk modulus is investigated. The pore stiffness primarily controls the relation between the static to dynamic bulk modulus. For sandstone, when the pore stiffness is greater than 6 GPa, the dynamic bulk modulus is approximately equal to the static bulk modulus. Under in-situ conditions when the rocks are fully saturated and under substantial stress load, the differences between the static and dynamic properties may be not important.

Brittleness is one of the key factors to locate shale “sweet spot”, since it can guide both hydraulic fracturing and designing of horizontal well trajectory. Unfortunately, brittleness cannot be measured directly from either well logging data or seismic data. The rock physics model has been proven as a useful tool for characterization of reservoir, which can be used to estimate the brittleness of shale reservoir. Shale shows high anisotropic property and ignoring shale anisotropy can induce errors in brittleness estimation. However, in oil industry, the common way to evaluate the brittleness of shale is based on using isotropic parameter (i.e. Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios), since it can be easily calculated based on measured elastic wave velocity from geophysical data. Anisotropic shale rock physics modeling offer us a new way to estimate the brittleness of shale from anisotropic aspect. In our study we analysis the anisotropic behavior of brittleness based on our anisotropic shale model. The results indicate vertical Young's moduli (YM) usually higher than horizontal YM, and vertical Poisson's ratios (PR) can be either higher or lower than horizontal PR, which may result from clay lamination. Finally, the anisotropic brittleness was estimated, which can provide extra information for petroleum engineers. |Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 26, 2017 |Start Time: 3:55 PM |Location: 351D |Presentation Type: ORAL|","Shale gas, Anisotropy, Geomechanics, VTI, Rock physics"

Soft clay soils were found in this region, requiring to be improved by the use of a innovative grouting technique called CPR Grouting. Since the primary objective of the ground improvement was to provide strength and limit settlements, quality control appeared more rational in terms of minimum modulus rather than of minimum penetration resistance. The MASW method evaluates subsurface shear-wave velocity (Vs) distribution by analyzing seismic surface waves that always maintain a strong signal-to-noise (SN) ratio. The shear-wave velocity (Vs) is a direct indicator of material's stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of the MASW surveys was to produce shear-wave velocity (Vs) profiles (1-D and 2-D) of natural and improved ground in order to evaluate the grouting efficiency by comparing subsurface velocity (Vs) distributions. Processing results of 2-D velocity (Vs) cross sections obtained from natural (untreated) and nearby improved (treated) grounds show velocity (Vs) increase by, up to, 50% for the depths of grouting observed throughout the entire lateral survey distance. This case study strongly indicates the seismic (MASW) method can provide a robust tool to evaluate and control the effectiveness of the grouting technique.

We investigate the feasibility of amplitude variation with offset (AVO) inversion based on the full Zoeppritz solutions for reflection amplitudes and the ability of the inversion to constrain important properties. By theoretical analysis and inversion tests, we determine behaviors of the AVO inversion solutions developed for isotropic media when the target shale formation instead has seismic anisotropy related to organic content. The anisotropy of the model shale is related to the kerogen volume fraction values using published laboratory data. Both theoretical results and inversion tests show that the inversion accurately determines normal incidence impedance, but that the velocity value corresponds to the horizontal P-wave velocity in the shale so that density is typically underestimated. Analysis of simple reflection coefficient solutions based on linearized approximations helps to explain why the inversion obtains the horizontal velocity of the shale. Though the linearized results are only applicable for lower values of kerogen volume fraction, the nonlinear inversion based on the full Zoeppritz results obtains reliable results even for strong anisotropy. The results also allow the estimation of Young’s modulus and the Poisson ratio. Based on the results and the analysis, we propose a workflow using this approach for shale reservoir characterization to define geophysical and geomechanical properties in both horizontal and vertical directions.

The DAS senses the vibration in the local environment around the fiber and provides a measure of the relative strain of the optical fiber. This remote sensing technique has provided unparalleled acoustic sampling from the subsurface during hydraulic fracturing of the horizontal MIP-3H well drilled in Marcellus Shale near Morgantown, WV. We will show that the energy of the extracted phase of DAS data (hDVS) has a strong negative correlation with natural fracture intensity P32. The hydrofracking stages with lower P32 show a higher DAS phase energy and vice versa. In addition, we will evaluate the correlation between DAS phase energy, microseismic energy, and injection energy during the hydrofracking in MIP-3H. DAS phase energy is linearly correlated with injection energy. The calculated microseismic energies, which are less than 0.1% of the injection energies, do not show a significant correlation with either DAS phase energy or injection energy. The negative correlation between P32 and either DAS phase energy or injection energy suggests less vibration in zones that are more naturally fractured. Numerous observed fractures from wireline image logs are resistive (healed), and appear to significantly control the hydrofracking efficiency in MIP-3H.

The movement of the water in the reservoirs was clearly observed and indicated by a hardening response above the Original Oil Water Contact (OOWC). Besides the movement of the water, these observations also provided a good indication of the OOWC location. These and other observations were used to update the reservoir model and thereby improve the predictions based on this model, including the expected outcome for future wells. The survey covered the imaging challenged subsalt area of the Atlantis Field and shows hints of time lapse response below the salt. The value of the information more than justified the cost of the survey, and as a result a new time lapse seismic data acquisition is being considered.

In particular, dispersion curves of flexural waves excited by such sources are sensitive to several factors: the intrinsic anisotropy of rock formations, stress concentrations near the borehole, inhomogeneities in the surrounding media (e.g., invaded zones, casing, etc.), and elastic property contrast between the solid (rock and/or casing) and the fluid (mud). This paper presents several forward modeling cases in which the mud and casing effects on the cross-dipole flexural wave dispersion behavior is studied in the context of measurement of horizontally transverse isotropic (HTI) anisotropy. It is observed that stress-induced anisotropy indicators, such as cross-overs in dispersion curves resulting from the differences between near-borehole and deep formation anisotropies, can be influenced by mud properties and the presence of casing. Therefore, inclusion of these influences in advanced inversion algorithms will yield more accurate anisotropy measurements.

When a hydraulic fracture activates a bedding plane or weakness plane, it could be deflected and propagates along a new plane, creating geometrically complex fractures and/or fracture networks. Some specific patterns of microseismic events could be induced as well. 
In this study, we use a dynamic finite element method (Duan, 2016) to examine dynamic stresses associated with a propagating hydraulic fracture, and activation of weakness/bedding planes that perpendicular to the hydraulic fracture. As a pilot study, we work in a 2D framework, e.g., map view at a certain depth. We find that the induced shear stresses on the weakness planes could be significant and comparable to the prestress levels, when the hydraulic fracture approaches the weakness planes. The principal stress orientations change near the hydraulic fracture tip, allowing resolved dynamic shear stresses to drive shear slip on the weakness planes. Dynamic stresses induced by the hydraulic fracture (stress perturbations) along the distance normal to fracture walls and away from its tip are analyzed. The shear slip and open width along the weakness planes are calculated in our models. We find that the weakness planes cannot be opened by the dynamic stress perturbations only. Different senses of shear can occur along the weakness planes on the two sides of the hydraulic fracture, due to different senses of induced dynamic shear stresses. We explore effects of modeling parameters on induced dynamic stresses and shear slip. These parameters include differential stresses, cohesion, critical slip distance (a frictional parameter), rock density, and seismic wave velocity. The maximum slip and slip length along the weakness planes decrease with differential stresses, cohesion, and critical slip distance, but in different patterns. The maximum slip also decreases with density and seismic wave velocity, but the slip length does not change.

The Lucaogou formation in Junggar basin is the most potential tight oil reservoir in China. However, the disappointing production of a pilot appraisal project with 10 horizontal wells adopting multistage fracturing hold back the further development. The multiple laminated sand-shale formation with horizontal beddings severely affect the fracture height and geometry. This paper provides comprehensive large-scale-block fracturing experiments and field microseismic monitoring data to examine the effect of the highly laminated rock fabric on fracture geometry. 
Hydraulic fracturing polyaxial tests were conducted using large-scale Lucaogou tight oil outcrops simulating a vertical well and horizontal well respectively. Cross-linked gel and slickwater were used to examine the effect of fluid viscosity on fracture propagation. Fracturing pressure analysis, acoustic emission monitoring, rock splitting and tracing the dyed fluid were combined to investigate the hydraulic fracture geometry and propagation mechanism. Field microseismic monitoring results along with the wellbore trajectory, stress profiles and formation characterization were also analyzed. 
Large-scale-block fracturing tests show that the treatment pressure in the fracture is increasing steady, which represent the severe fracture containment or high process-zone stress, both are indication of bad stimulation potential. Rock splitting and acoustic emission mapping results proved that fracture initiated and propagated along the horizontal bedding. And the rock heterogeneity and natural fracture play a decisive role in fracture propagation. Field microseismic monitoring results also indicate that the monitoring fracture geometry is much more complicated than predicted. The microseismic mapping shows that fracture propagates downward when the stimulated interval was drilled below the target layer and propagate upward or confined in the pay zone when the interval was drilled above the target layer. Both laboratory and field results suggest that the hydraulic fracture of Luchaogou tight oil reservoir is almost determined both by the landing place in the formation and the natural fractures. Bedding-parallel stimulation would hinder fracture height and more complexity might be observed in a microseismic cloud, but it would probably not beneficial for production. Moreover, when we start flow back and the weight of the overburden is realized, the bedding planes being propped open could lose conductivity because of embedment and proppant pack collapsed. 
The identification of the target layer in the centimeter-level laminated Luchaogou tight oil formation was challenging and the multiple horizontal beddings severely confined and hinder the fracture propagating vertically, even though larger fluid and proppant volume were injected at higher rate. Well trajectory, natural fracture identification and its direction and layer heterogeneity are the major concerns when stimulated highly laminated formation, which is a typical characteristic of China's tight oil reservoirs.|","microseismic, Fracture Containment, Laminated, Hydraulic Fracture Propagation, polyaxial tests"

Keshen gas field, located on the northern margin of the Tarim basin, Western China, is an unconventional sandstone tight gas reservoir with extreme reservoir conditions: ultra-deep, low porosity, low matrix permeability, high temperature and high pore pressure. In order to gain economic production most wells should be stimulated to enhance single well performance. Previous studies show that natural fractures (NF) play the most important role on productivity. Detailed studies on block KS2 found that well performance is controlled by the intersection angle (<U+03B8>) between NF strike and direction of the maximum horizontal stress. When the interaction angle is small, well productivity is good. Otherwise, well productivity is poor. Based on this conclusion, different simulation options were proposed: 1) Acid hydraulic fracturing for wells with small angle, and 2) Proppant hydraulic fracturing for wells with big angle. New problems were meet when we applied this rule to other blocks, such as block KS8. In this block most wells reached a good production even if the intersection angle is big (>40°). Therefore, it is unreasonable to determine stimulation options based on the intersection angle for these wells. 
In order to establish alternative stimulation options, deeper analyze focused on natural fractures has been conducted. First, the tectonic history was studied to understand the NF creation and it was found that natural fractures are associated with two main tectonic phases. Most of the natural fractures developed during the earliest phase are infilled by calcite or shale(set 1), Whereas NFs developed during the last phase are open or partially open, have high permeability and are contributing to the production(set 2). Wells with reticular NFs have two sets of NFs and have high production. Advanced analyses of borehole images, including fracture classification according to the tectonic events, fracture density, and intersection angle computation, allowed us to create four main classes: class 1: presence of reticular fractures, class 2: parallel fractures with small intersection angle, class 3: parallel fractures with big intersection angle, and class 4: no natural fractures. New stimulation options were proposed based on these four classes: class 1: acidizing without hydraulic fracturing, class 2: acid hydraulic fracturing, class 3: proppant hydraulic fracturing, and class 4: it is hard to get economic production for these wells, even if the proppant hydraulic fracturing is operated. 
These new stimulation options have been applied in new blocks of Keshen tight gas field and provide a practical way to optimize the stimulation, to ensure well performance, and to reduce the cost associated with multiple stimulation phases in this tight gas field.|","Natural Fracture Evaluation, Stimulation Optimization, GeoEngineering Integrated Workflow, HTHP Tight Gas"

Water-swellable packer (WSP) is used rather than oil-swellable packer (OSP) for open-hole packer-sleeve (OHPS) fracturing and completion in China. In this paper, the two improved WSPs including hybrid external casing packer (ECP) and WSP with corrugated packing element are developed to solve the problem of tripping and deployment in irregular horizontal wellbore. The hybrid ECP combines mechanical-set packer with water-swellable packing element. The WSP with corrugated packing elements makes structure more compact than the traditional packer. 
The two solutions were successfully evaluated by bench test. The former combines the feature of high-rating sealing performance, instant fracturing operation with swelling-assistant isolation. The latter has advantages of smaller size, high reliability and easy tripping over traditional WSP. 
During OHPS multistage fracturing trial in Sulige gas field, the first five-stage operations are performed with hybrid ECPs and the last two-stage fracture diversion treatment are performed with new WSPs. The fracture diversion was carried out by injecting temporary plugging agents (TPA). The sealing effectiveness is fully validated by long-time ambient pressure differential during fracture diversion. It is shown from field operation that the new OHPS based on improved ECPs is able to meet the requirements of completion and stimulation in irregular horizontal wellbore for tight sandstone reservoirs.|","external casing packer, corrugated packing element, water-swellable, open-hole packer-sleeve fracturing, fracture diversion"

The Surat Basin Coal Seam Gas (CSG) is maturing from exploration to production to meet sales targets for several Liquefied Natural Gas projects. This requires effective and predictable reservoir performance that is controlled by permeability, gas saturation and matching the well completion technique to the ground conditions. Permeability in coal has major dependence on in-situ stress and natural fractures, and these will have characteristics that vary from field scale to larger regional scale faults and folds. This study investigates the spatial and stratigraphic variability of stress and fracture orientation relative to measured permeability within the Walloon Subgroup (WSG) that hosts CSG resources within the Surat Basin. 
Open file wireline data from 33 vertical wells across the eastern part of the Surat Basin are used to calculate the in-situ stress orientation and fracture distributions within the WSG. Present day in-situ stress orientations were identified from the borehole breakout and drilling induced tensile fractures. Permeability data from 13 wells are compared using the in-situ stress and fracture data from image log interpretation. 
CSG reservoir permeability is, in general sensitive to the changes in effective stress and primary permeability is reduced exponentially with increasing effective vertical stress. However, this relationship does not always hold true. Permeability within the WSG is also affected by the angle between present day in-situ stress orientation and fracture or joint trends and fracture dip angle. Wells in the relatively simple structural areas with subtle faulting show higher permeability when the coal fracture trends are parallel and up to 40 degrees to the present day in-situ stress. Permeability is significantly less outside this range. Most of the high permeability zones tend to occur in the areas where there is significant rotation of in-situ stress from the regional mean stress orientation (commonly ENE – WSW). The observed stress rotation is attributed to the stress perturbations mainly from folds and faults within the Surat sedimentary succession, suggesting local structural influence on the permeability distribution within the WSG. Few analyses of permeability versus stress and fracture properties are in the public domain for the Surat Basin. This study illustrates the connection between different structural domains, stress and fractures in previously unidentified areas of oblique-slip faulting, in some cases reactivating and in others creating new features from basement through the Jurassic to Tertiary succession.|","Coal Seam Gas, In-situ stress and fracture, Walloon Subgroup, Surat Bain, Permeability"

""Block X,"" located in offshore Sabah is operated by JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration (Deepwater Sabah) Limited., which had drilled several exploration wells and acquired extensive wireline and LWD information to evaluate the block for further exploration and future development. Drilling exploration wells in a deepwater environment can lead to drilling difficulties. For example, a very narrow safe mud weight window was encountered in the discovery Well X and subsequent drilling difficulties delayed the well delivery. In orderto minimize the drilling risk for upcoming prospects, detailed petrophysical, geological and geomechanical studies have been conducted based on extensive evaluation of wireline and LWD data. 
Determination of horizontal stress directions and magnitudes are an important part of building the 1D mechanical earth model, which allows optimizing perforation and completion design, and production planning. Knowledge of the stress directions also helps to optimize well trajectory design so that wellbore instability can be minimized. Several methods for identifying stress directions are available and investigated, including borehole breakout orientation and shear sonic anisotropy information. For complementing the existing drilling data (leak-off and formation integrity tests), the horizontal stress magnitudes are determined using the dipole radial profiles and the sonic anisotropy using acoustoelasticity theory. 
The variation in shear sonic slowness within the elastic region of the rock is compared to the stress distribution caused by the presence of the wellbore. The relationship between shear slowness (modulus) and stress is then established to provide the acoustoelastic coefficient and horizontal stress magnitudes (both minimum and maximum) are then determined. These results were used to reduce uncertainty in the state of stress, and used in optimizing the wellbore trajectories for future development wells. 
In the current study, besides conventional stress calibration data such as LOT/FIT and calliper information, advanced sonic information helped to calibrate further the stress profile, which resulted in a comprehensive understanding of the stress regime of the study area. These results are utilized to better design the mud weight program for the drilling of future Deepwater prospects in Block X.|","advanced accoustic processing, deep water, Geomechanics"

In particular, the social and environmental impact of E&P industry must be wisely evaluated and monitored. Following this direction, the Italian Oil & Gas Safety Authority (DGS-UNMIG, a Directorate General of the Ministry of Economic Development) issued a new set of monitoring guidelines for future licensing and E&P operations in Italy. After the seismic sequence of May 2012 in Northern Italy, a public discussion pointed out that these earthquakes could have been related to possible ""anthropogenic"" causes, i.e., a seismic activity induced or triggered by underground fluids withdrawal. For this reason, the Italian Department of Civil Protection appointed an independent international scientific commission to evaluate all available geoscience data to shed light on this hypotesis. In particular, three production fields, located near the epicenters of the seismic sequence, were closely examined: 1) a geothermal field; 2) an underground natural gas storage field; 3) a mature oilfield with reinjection. According to the conclusions of the above International Commission, the National Oil & Gas Safety Authority issued a new document of monitoring guidelines. In particular, future E&P operations in Italy must be complemented by properly designed monitoring networks aimed at controlling the: a) seismic activity; b) ground deformation; c) reservoir pressure. The monitoring networks must be implemented as soon as practicable when licensing is granted, in order to evaluate prior local seismicity and ground deformation with a sufficient accuracy. Moreover, monitored data must be made available to the safety Authorities, and thorough informative actions to residents and stakeholders must be properly carried out.

This paper discusses a set of laboratory experiments on coal core samples, which seek to understand the changes in coal fracture permeability with varying confining stress, pore pressure and methane adsorption.

The first investigated the impact of higher burial pressures on permeability, a four-fold reduction in permeability was measured with confining pressure increase from 150-750psi. The second replicated the reduction in pore pressure during dewatering the intention was to measure ‘stress-dependent permeability’, a halving of permeability was observed with pore pressure reduction from 220-30psi. The final two experiments used methane gas to investigate the effect of coal shrinkage with changing pore pressure. Under constant stress conditionspermeability halved and under constant volume conditions permeability saw a significant fifteen-fold reduction. 
Focus on the resulting magnitude of permeability change is more important at the current stage of this study than the absolute permeability change. The magnitude of permeability change can be used assensitivity in numerical simulation studies toassess the impact of pressure dependency of coal permeability and therefore better characterise coal reservoir behaviour and, consequently, improve the accuracy of any forecast derived from the reservoir model.|","Reservoir characterisation, Core testing, Coal Seam Gas"

The Woodford shale in Oklahoma is an ultra-low permeability reservoir that must be effectively fracture stimulated for the development of shale oil. Hundreds of horizontal wells with 4000ft-5000ft lateral length were stimulated by hydraulic fracture technology. Several pilots with 9000ft lateral length were also tested to figure out the relationship between lateral length and outcome. The research found that the shape of manual fracturein Woodford(WDFD) formation is the most important factor affecting the production. 
The wells were stimulated in stages with large hydraulic fracture treatments. However, production isn't directly related to the size of the stimulated volume. Microseismic mapping techniques, simulation method, post-production analysis and formationstress calculation are cooperated to study the characteristics of fracture extension. It is found that there are two kinds of fracture shape which are different from Barnett shale. This paper will test the effect of fracturing liquid and proppant on the fracture growth; The values of triaxial stresswere obtained in the neighboring layers and WDFD formation; Finally, the pilot wellisan example to illuminate fracture extension.

Microseismic monitoring technology is widely used to characterize the fracture network and provide enough information on fracture geometry and properties. We go beyond the existing method that uses planar fractures or orthogonal conjugate fractures for representing the fracture network. Our novel method of characterization involves an integrated workflow to utilize L-system based fractal geometry to describe fracture propagation pattern, density and network connectivity. Integer programming is incorporated into matching the origination points of the microseismic events during the fracture geometry matching procession. Furthermore, multilevel of the fractal fracture network model (FFNM) is calibrated by using genetic algorithm to help specifying the properties of fracture network. The additional rate transient analysis allows to interpret the relationship between well performance and complex fracture network features. The application of this workflow on unconventional shale gas start with calculating fractal fracture network geometry and determining fracture length for both hydraulic fracture and induced fracture. And also estimating stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and fracture parameters with combination of production data. Field case study is presented for fractured horizontal well, the matching result shows that the fracture propagation path has a good fitness with microseismic event. We also carry out rate transient analysis to interpreting the performance of complex fracture network parameters. This indicates that only connected stimulated fractures does most of the contribution to gas production. The better connectivity of multi-level fracture network, the better performance of fractured well during long time development. Besides, the most significant new finding is that SRV increases as fractal fracture induced levels increase, and this relationship appears to be fracture geometry-dependent. The novelty of this new method is expected to become a more efficient process for accurate characterization of shale reservoir complex fracture network and improvement hydraulic fracture optimization.|","History matching, Fracture Network Characterization, Microseismic, Rate transient analysis, Fractal Theory"

Past drilling of vertical and moderately deviated development wells in offshore Peninsular Malaysia and Vietnam has proven to be challenging. Drilling experience in the development wells highlighted the issue of wellbore instability in the respective areas, particularly though coal seams. Numerous lost-time incidents related to wellbore instability-related problems were experienced, ranging from tight hole (remedied by reaming) to overpull, pack-off followed by stuck pipe, fill on-bottom to difficulties in running casing, and coal cavings to high gas associated with drilling breaks. These problems were observed particularly when drilling through the weak shales with interbedded unstable coals. 
Coal instability often does not respond to the same remediation used in shale, where we usually simply raise the mud weight to reduce the compressional hoop stress below the strength of the rock. Borehole collapse or breakout may still occur when the coal cleats and natural fractures allow the drilling fluid filtrate to invade despite using an optimum mud weight. This results in pressurization of the near-wellbore region and loss of effective mud weight support for coal stability. All the wells in the respective areas were drilled with WBM and so drilling performance benchmarking with other drilling fluids was not possible in the study area. Faced with continual NPT, a geomechanical study was initiated to mitigate the coal related wellbore instability problems. The recommendations arising from the comprehensive geomechanical and drilling experience analyses have been implemented to improve performance during subsequent development drilling. 
This paper highlights the importance of integrating geomechanics with proper drilling practices when developing strategies to mitigate unstable hole problems, especially related to coals. A full-scale geomechanical model was developed, validated and updated using logs and drilling data from wells in both the areas. The drilling experiences, rock mechanical properties, in-situ stresses and formation pressure in both the areas are presented and discussed in detail. A detailed recommendation on the drilling strategy through coal and the associated uncertainties was implemented. Utilization of geomechanical results from the two studies and the approach adopted in the development of drilling strategies helped to determine recommended optimal mud weight programs for the future wells. 
Subsequent drilling campaigns have all been successful by incorporation of the entire risk and mitigation plan. This included a generalized road map with a protocol for drilling through coal, tripping and back reaming during drilling, pre-drilling and post-drilling. This effort, together with optimized drilling fluid design and the correct mud weight based on previous drilling experience as per recommended wellbore stability assessments, helped in two recently drilled wells in different areas with reduced NPT.|","Wellbore Stability, Drilling Fluids, Non Productive Time, Coal Geomechanics, Drilling Optimisation"

Lost circulation is a challenging problem to be prevented or mitigated in the Dammam formation. Major progress is made to detect lost circulation and how to combat it. This paper describes the study of lost circulation events in more than 75 wells in South Rumaila field. Data are analyzed to determine the best ranges for key drilling parameters and provide the best remedial strategies, which have the greatest chance of mitigating or preventing this problem. 
Real field data (e.g. MW, ECD, Yp, RPM, SPM, and ROP) at the time of each event are recorded along with the lost circulation remedies attempted, and the outcome of those remedies. Practical field information from South Rumaila field and range of sources are reviewed and summarized to develop an integrated methodology and flowchart for handling lost circulation events in this zone. This paper will be extended work along with previous comprehensive statistical study and sensitivity analysis models about the Dammam formation. In addition, economic evaluation analysis is conducted for partial, severe, and complete losses to obtain the best field procedures. 
Proactive approaches are made prior entering the Dammam formation to prevent or mitigate the occurrence of the lost circulation. A broad statistical work, primitive mechanisms, typical drilling fluid properties, and recommended operational drilling parameters are estimated to use during drilling through this zone. Moreover, corrective actions are determined for each kind of the mud losses to provide efficient remedies, minimize non-productive time, and reduce cost. The best lost circulation strategy to the Dammam formation is concluded and summarized depending on a comprehensive statistical work, the most important courses of the international oil companies, technical papers, textbooks, and economic analysis evaluation to determine successful remedies for each type of the losses. These treatments are classified by relying on the mud losses classifications to avoid unwanted consequences due to inappropriate actions. In addition, engineered solutions and practical techniques are developed, which will contribute to give clear image and coherent understanding in regard this complicated and costly problem in the Dammam formation.

Commercial development of coalbed methane (CBM) in China has lasted for a decade. However, in 2015 annual CBM production in China was less than 5 Bcm and lagged far behind those in US (35 Bcm) and Australia (18 Bcm). In this paper, we review the published literature to determine the engineering challenges and opportunities of CBM production in China. Our review has identified seven major engineering challenges to CBM development in China. They are low cleat permeability and underpressured formation pressure of high-rank coals, ductility of coal seams, suboptimal fracturing fluids, formation damage during drilling, borehole instability in horizontal wells, frequent pump failures during production, and inadequate produced water treatment methods. 
Each of these challenges provides an opportunity for improvement. We propose a refocus on low-rank coals which have higher permeability. Other opportunities include development of better hydraulic fracturing fluids, non-formation damaging drilling fluids, use of geomechanics to understand borehole instability, optimization of the artificial lift methods and more robust and environmentally friendly produced water treatment methods.|","coalbed methane, China, CBM, Ordos Basin, Qinshiu Basin"

In the current oil price environment, all new developments are pursued with minimum capital investment and lowest possible operating cost to improve project economics. Projects that do not meet the economic criteria have to be shelved or deferred to a later date. This was the case for a green gas field development in Peninsular Malaysia which was shelved in 2016, resulting in an added preservation requirement for the newly-fabricated topside facilities and pipelines. The increase in project cost due to the preservation requirements, eroded the project economics which necessitates all possible cost reductions in order to make the overall project economically viable. 
One possible area for cost reduction is the sand management. Sand production is expected from the shallower I-group reservoirs targeted in the gas development. This is based on well test results conducted in one of the appraisal wells which is further supported by a sand production prediction (SPP) study. Based on the available Particle Size Distribution (PSD) data from a Laser Particle Sieve Analysis (LPSA), the reservoir particle D50 is about 55µm and has more than 40% fines content. Due to the multilayer reservoir targets, cased hole development were designed for the well hence Internal Gravel pack (IGP) is selected as the downhole sand exclusion method. 
Over the life of the field, fines production is anticipated due to the high fines content of the reservoir. There is also risk of IGP failure which could result in eroded tubings, flowlines and headers. This would be catasthropic for the green field due to its unmanned operation philosophy. Moreover, during the facilities detailed design, the provision for surface desander was eliminated to make way for a compact platform design. 
This paper will describe the methodology used to assess the severity of sand production to the surface facilities using the well and reservoir parameters. The assessment results provide the basis for the field integrated sand management philosophy, which helps management to make an informed decision to eliminate the real time sand monitoring and control system requirements and also eliminate the need for platform deck extension for desander installation requirement.|","Erosion Determination, Software, Online sand probes, Sand Management"

Multizone Single Trip Gravel Pack (MZ-STGP) Completion has been utilized as primary sand control system in Total E&P Indonesie. Over 250 wells have been successfully delivered since 2005 to maintain production plateau. Currently, the main challenge of this system is how to tackle number of marginal wells with higher geological uncertainties. 
In order to ensure well economy, several completion systems need to be prepared as an alternative of the MZ-STGP in order to adapt with the actual well reserve. In fact, the alternative systems should have flexibility to replace MZ-STGP in a very short time to avoid rig standby. This paper will review the alternative solutions which provide both capability and flexibility to replace MZ-STGP in a very short time in order to unlock marginal reservoirs. 
Thorough engineering design and progressive trial were performed since 2008 with the involvement of drilling contractors and transverse entities. The main objective of the trial is to implement the alternative system safely without hinder production performance and keep maintaining overall cost as minimum as possible. Mahakam Sand Control Tool Box (M-STOB) was then developed as group of alternative solutions to tackle the challenges mentioned above. It consists of four main solutions; Modular Gravel Pack System, Openhole Solution, Slim Gravel Pack and Thru Tubing Sand Control.

The drilling of wells offshore West Madura, East Java, can be challenging. The geological structure of the area often requires drilling at high deviations with large stepouts, through formations consisting of carbonates, shales and sands. As a result, wellbore stability issues are frequently encountered, such as total mud losses, stuck pipe, loss of bottom hole assemblies and associated sidetracking, leading to non-productive drilling time and unnecessary costs. In order to lower the associated risks the operator commissioned a geomechanics study, to identify the root causes of the wellbore stability issues, and provide recommendations for improved drilling of future development wells. 
Numerous wells had been drilled within the area of interest over more than three decades, resulting in a large variation in the availability and quality of data. Recently acquired 3D seismic data were also available. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach was employed with geomechanics at its core, accompanied by well log conditioning, generation of synthesized shear sonic logs, simultaneous seismic inversion, and drilling engineering. The integration of the different disciplines ensured the development of robust 1D and 3D geomechanical models, which were applied to develop mud weight recommendations for the planned development wells. 
Firstly, a 1D geomechanical model was constructed. Two recently drilled wells had excellent data sets: extended leakoff and minifrac test results showed very consistent fracture closure pressures. This, combined with the presence of borehole breakouts and direct rock strength measurements on core, allowed the determination of the minimum and maximum horizontal stresses with only small ranges of uncertainty. The 1D geomechanical model was further calibrated by a detailed comparison with critically reviewed drilling incidents. Simultaneously, well logs were conditioned and pseudologs were created, which were used for 3D simultaneous seismic inversion, from which rock property volumes (P-impedance, S-impedance, and Vp/Vs) were derived in turn. Gardner’s relationship was used to transform the seismic velocity data to a density volume. The 1D geomechanical model was subsequently combined with the 3D seismic data via a structural model grid, resulting in a full 3D geomechanical model containing cubes of pore pressure, principal insitu stresses, elastic rock properties and rock strength. Finally, wellbore stability analyses were performed for the planned development wells, including a quantitative risk assessment to gauge the impact of uncertainties in various key variables on the overall potential drilling success. Well deviation and azimuth sometimes showed a counterintuitive effect on recommended mud weights, as illustrated by stereonet plots. 
A key factor in the execution of this project was the integration of data and expertise in petrophysics, seismic inversion, geomechanics and drilling engineering over a relatively short timeframe to deliver a technically robust set of mud weight windows, which, combined with recommendations based on a detailed review of passed drilling practices, should enable the successful drilling of the wells in this very challenging environment.|","geomechanics, drilling, Offshore West Madura, rock physics, wellbore stability"

Casing restriction was encountered during workovers in 10 wells in a field onshore Central Sumatra, Indonesia. The field is operated by BOB PT Bumi Siak Pusako – Pertamina Hulu. The problem was encountered in a shallow thin sand in the depleted mature field. 
A geomechanical study was conducted to determine whether the casing restriction/deformation was from excessive loading, which may have been caused by reservoir deformation and/or shearing because of fault slippages. Geomechanical factors that can contribute to casing loading and shearing include sand failure leading to cavity formation and the loss of casing support in the production interval, reservoir deformation/compaction, faulting from pore pressure changes (depletion or injection) and the corresponding stress changes. 
A field-specific geomechanical model was constructed using data acquired in four offset wells drilled in the field to quantify the stresses on the reservoir rock and the existing fault(s) under depletion and subsequent water injection. The model was used in failure analyses to determine whether the stresses were sufficient to cause rock failures and fault slippage that could potentially have deformed the casings. 
The study highlights the value of geomechanics as a tool in the petroleum industry for solving production issues in mature fields. Understanding the risk of rock failure because of pore pressure and stress changes enables optimization of well placement, completion design, production parameters and reservoir management to maximize recovery of mature fields.|","reservoir deformation, casing restriction, mature field, Casing deformation, geomechanics"

Since the coal seam is soft with low permeability in China, the stimulation effect of vertical well hydraulic fracturing technology is limited while horizontal well fracturing has instable wellbore leading to wellbore collapsing. Therefore, floor horizontal well hydraulic fracturing technology is proposed, that is drilling in the floor sandstone and connecting the coal seam by hydraulic fractures. A test area has been undertaken in 3# coal seam, southern Qinshui Basin, to demonstrate this technology. Through optimizing the well path, borehole structure, fracturing designs, and fracture propagation performance, a set of treatments were developed and applied successfully. The result shows that drilling floor horizontal well along with minimum horizontal principle stress, applying U-type well structure, and designing fractures with 3 stages, 130m half fracture length and 30D·cm flow conductivity achieves better production performance.|","Virtual producing seam, Coal seat, Staged fracturing, Horizontal well, Coalbed methane"

The current state of oil and gas economics has emphasized focus in managing and optimizing production from mature fields. It is estimated that approximately 70% of the world's oil and gas production are contributed by mature fields. Sand production is common as pressure declines and water breakthrough takes place. Clastic reservoirs with unconsolidated formation sand with moderate and high permeability are prone to produce sand under these conditions. In gas producing environments, conventional sand control can place demands for continued expensive remediation investment through the wells producing life as high gas velocity increases the chances of erosion and failure of downhole equipment. Gas reservoirs have always been an integral part Malaysia's oil and gas business. As the well the portfolio expands to cater for the regional energy demand, focus on fit for purpose sand control in gas wells is crucial in ensuring continuous production delivery to customers. As a current practice, sand production has been handled by standalone metal screens or combined with gravel packing. One of the cheaper options available in the market is the ceramic sand screen that allows for rigless installation while providing durable material which is resistant to erosion caused by high gas velocity for a continuous production as the ceramic material is 10 times harder than steel (Jackson et al., 2015) and it is more resistant to corrosion in comparison to steel (Wheeler et al., 2014). 
This paper will focus on the revival strategy of a gas well with a currently damaged screen due to erosion. As this is the first through tubing ceramic sand screen deployment in a gas well in Malaysia, a feasibility process was put place to ensure safe operation and deployment success. Depending on the current well completion profiles, the assessment includes selection of sand screen specification, actual installation sequence, methodology in ensuring safe and successful deployment of ceramic sand screen downhole are focused.

The intermediate phase on South Mahakam (SMK) field presented technical and economical challenges due to multiple bit runs, attributable to thick carbonates with Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) up to 30K psi. The typical phase is either 12-1/4"" or 8-1/2"", reaching 1600m long with 90% containing the carbonates. Initially, different configurations of 8-1/2"" Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) bits with durability in mind were selected but failed to deliver performance with more than 1 run required. Poor post-run dull gradings were observed reflecting broken/worn out cutters, and even blades ring out. 
A recent campaign on SMK introduced two new 12-1/4"" bit designs. First, a Hybrid bit (Roller Cone – Fixed Cutter PDC) was selected following a positive global experience on hard formations. A second trial involved a PDC with a Conical Diamond Element profile in the secondary cutter row – aimed to deliver high loading point to fracture hard formations and ease drill out. Both designs managed to drill the section in 1 run and delivered record speed. 
The Hybrid bit managed to deliver at an almost double Penetration Rate (14.9 m/hr) than previous runs. Its durability was however limited by the seal life of the Cone. During run, a real-time monitoring of parameters and Minimum Specific Energy (MSE) was performed to detect for failures. Despite the precautions, a seal was damaged and the bit was undergauged. A control trip was triggered eliminating the cost saved for drilling in 1 run. 
Conversely, the PDC with secondary conical elements delivered higher performance (29.6 m/hr) with dull grading allowing for a re-run under the same conditions. The bit became the standard for SMK, continuously delivering the phase in 1 run, a saving of 5 days. 
This paper will analyze the cause of the Hybrid bit damage and how parameters monitoring did not pick up failure signals. It will also highlight the success of the bit conical elements in terms of practicality and effectiveness for drilling hard carbonates in SMK.|","Secondary Conical Diamond Element Bit, Minimum Specific Energy, Bit Failure Detection, Hard Carbonates, Hybrid Bit"

Inflow Control Devices (ICDs) are an advanced well completion device used primarily in horizontal wells to enable more efficient reservoir flow performance and to mitigate common production issues by applying an additional pressure drop to choke high productivity zones. This study aims to identify design philosophies that provide for the most robust ICD design, and to determine if ICDs can be implemented for subsurface uncertainty mitigation. As there is no ability to adjust ICD settings once installed without major recompletion, a completion design that is robust to reservoir uncertainty at and away from the wellbore is critical. While ICD design follows a basic set of guidelines, several different approaches exist for each step within this workflow. A major design aspect relates to the design of target inflow profiles (equal inflow or U-shaped inflow). The U-shaped target inflow profile hypothesis was initially proposed for homogenous wells. This study proposes a modification to the existing design philosophy to cater to heterogeneous reservoirs. There is evidence supporting the use of the less conventional U-shaped target inflow profile in ICD design over the more commonly used equal inflow profile method. Sensitivity and robustness under reservoir uncertainty and heterogeneity for each ICD design methodology was assessed using 3-dimensional numerical reservoir simulation of layered and non-layered heterogeneous block models, followed by extensive uncertainty analysis. It was found that ICD completions may be unsuitable as a method for uncertainty mitigation and use of ICDs for this reason must be thoroughly investigated using full uncertainty analysis in dynamic simulation.|","ICD design, Inflow control device, U shape inflow, Uncertainty management, Reservoir heterogeneity"

Following North America, shale gas has been proved to be a success in China, considering the commercial exploitation of shale gas in Sichuan province in China, and a continuous increase in the past few years and a good momentum in the next few years. This mainly attributes to the horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing technologies and huge capital investment. However, we need to face that even using these advanced technologies, a sharp decrease of the production during the development still exists in all shale gas wells, due to the tightness of the shale matrix and the pressure drop in the fracture network. 
According to the successful experience of enhanced coalbed methane recovery all over the world, CO2 injection shows a promising future in EGR (enhanced gas recovery) process for shale reservoirs. In the meanwhile, CO2 can be simultaneously sealed underground to reduce pollution. Therefore, in order to guide the engineering process, it is of great importance to reveal the CO2 and CH4 absorption behaviors at microscopic scale,but the corresponding mechanism is as yet unclear. This is because the competitive adsorption process of CO2 and CH4 underground can be affected by a lot of parameters, such as pore size, temperature, pressure, CO2 concentration, etc., and laboratory experiment is usually difficult to carry out, due to limited laboratory temperature and pressure conditions, and difficulty in separating porous OM from shale, etc. 
In this paper, we employ molecular simulation of CO2-CH4 competitive adsorption behavior in organic matter (OM) nano pores. Using Longmaxi shale as sample, OM pore structure was first characterized using FIB-SEM and scanning ion microscope, and pore-size distribution was studied using N2 adsorption. Then a simplified pillar-layer model was used to study CH4 adsorption behavior and competitive adsorption effect between CO2 and CH4, using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method. Results indicate that nanopores with good connectivity widely exist in OM, offering important storage space for absorbed shale gas. The amount of adsorbed CH4 can increase with lower temperature and increased pressure, and overpressure will significantly increase the amount of CH4 adsorbed underground; CO2 shows high competitive adsorption ability; CO2/CH4 selectivity coefficient decreases dramatically with increasing temperature or pressure, or both, and it corresponds to deeper burial depth. CO2 EGR during shale gas exploration will be more efficient, if it is conducted after the pressure drops to a certain degree.|","CO2 flooding, Molecular Simulation, shale gas"

The lack of planning for well plug and abandonment (P&A) during the well-construction phase can significantly contribute to the extended operational time and associated high cost of P&A. The impact on time and cost is mainly due to insufficient well data, uncertain casing cement integrity, and lack of information on competent formation for permanent barrier placement. Undocumented pressure and stress evolution, and well events also can contribute to increased time and cost of P&A. 
Although new technologies can reduce plug and abandonment cost, another approach is to effectively plan for well abandonment during the front end engineering design (FEED) and well-construction phases and during drilling of new wells. 
This paper examines recommendations for improvement and requirements that should be addressed by the industry, regulators, and operators to introduce clear well-abandonment requirements into FEED and well-construction phases for new drilled wells.  –

For the multi-stage fracturing in horizontal shale gas well, the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) is a pivotal parameter to determine the fracturing performance. However, SRV estimation remains a longstanding challenge in shale gas reservoir due to its complex forming mechanism, most of the current SRV estimation methods are either expensive or time-consuming. In this paper, a 3D mathematical model of SRV is established by simulating the four key processes—multiple hydraulic fractures propagation, reservoir pressure lifting, formation stress variation and natural fractures failure—during each fracturing stage in shale gas reservoir. This model considers the interference effect of multiple fractures, and subdivides the SRV into shear-SRV and tensile-SRV according to the failure type of natural fractures network. In order to validate the feasibility and reliability of the model, it was first implemented to a pilot well in the FL gas field in southwest China to estimate a SRV that matches well with the microseismic signals monitored onsite. Then, this model was applied to FL gas field on a large scale, the application results show that although most horizontal wells have been effectively fractured with desired SRV, there are still unstimulated regions left between neighboring wells, so it needs to drill infill wells in current well pattern and reduce the well spacing in the future. This research explores an efficient method to estimate the SRV without high cost or complicated process, provides the theoretical basis and guidelines for pre-fracturing design and post-fracturing evaluation in shale gas reservoir.|","shale gas, stimulated reservoir volume, multi-stage fracturing, field application, mathematical modeling"

This article presents a novel organic-inorganic crosslinked polymer gel, which uses resin-silicate as the organic-inorganic crosslinker, to extend the temperature limitations of currently used polymer gels for water control in mature oilfields. The gelation performances, including gelation time, gel strength and thermal stability, were studied, and the optimum composition was selected by study of gelation performances. Results show that with increase of the concentrations of components, gelation time became shorter and gel strength was improved. And the gel system was stable after 90 days at 140 °C. The optimum composition of the gel system was selected as: 4~7 wt% resin and 2~5 wt% silicate with 0.1~0.3 wt% polymer. Meanwhile, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was used to investigate the maximum tolerated temperature of the gel. The results showed that the chemical bonds of the gel began to break at 156 °C, which indicated that the gel can resist high temperature up to 156 °C. At last, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) microstructure and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum of the gel were studied to analyze the gelation process and investigate the mechanism for temperature resistance. The three-dimensional network microstructure of the resin-silicate crosslinked polymer gel was more compact and more uniform than the gel prepared without silicate. The formation of silicon-oxygen bonds (Si-O) increased the crosslinking density and temperature tolerance of the gel system.|","temperature resistance mechanism, organic-inorganic crosslinked polymer gel, ultra-high temperature reservoirs, water control"

This case study reports a comprehensive sanding study program for two offshore gas-condensate fields. The results from geomechanics laboratory testing and modeling of sand production were implemented into real-time monitoring of production wells using the Production Data Management System (PDMS). Sand detectors were also instrumented on all production wellheads and integrated into the real-time monitoring. The program will help define the envelopes of optimized production while ensuring safety of production facilities. 
Comprehensive geomechanics laboratory testing was conducted on reservoir cores retrieved from exploration and production wells. In addition to unconfined compression tests and TWC tests, the testing included triaxial tests with acoustic velocities during hydrostatic confinement as well as deviatoric axial loading to determine formation rock strength and deformation behaviors. The laboratory results were then used to calibrate strength and elastic properties logs used in sand production modeling. Optimized production envelopes for each well could then be determined. Finally, the modeling results were integrated into PDMS so that downhole gauge pressure and sand detector readings could be monitored and managed real-time for all production wells. 
The results revealed that many reservoirs in Hai Thach and Moc Tinh fields have relatively low strength and therefore moderate sanding potential. This study would help define the envelopes of optimized production while ensuring safety of production facilities. These envelopes included sanding prevention criteria in addition to criteria to optimize condensate production and minimize water production. Regarding sand production, downhole gauge pressure are monitored real-time and managed so that drawdowns are below sand production threshold at current reservoir pressures. The key functionality goal is real-time collaboration between onshore and offshore to establish reliable information for reservoir monitoring, improving modeling, and production losses mitigation, which significantly improves production through a proactive well management.|","sand production, Vietnam, real-time monitoring, case study"

Keshen gas field is located at Kuqa foreland area of Tarim Basin, western China. The surface is mountainous, the environment is tough and the ecosystem is fragile. Through seven years’ development of this field, a natural gas productivity of 5 billion cubic meters per year was obtained by drilling 45 ultra-deep HPHT wells and building a pipeline system of 140km long with zero environment pollution. 41 towns and 4 million residents benefited from this project. 
The location of processing plant and pipeline network pattern were selected through node analysis and topology analysis. A fishbone-like pipeline system was selected to avoid the mountainous area and minimize disturbance to the local environment. High-pressure throttling refrigeration technique and high-efficient gas separation technique were also used, reducing the energy consumption for processing by 45%. Electricity was used in drilling instead of diesel, which reduced CO2 emission by 220,000 tons. 140MPa wellhead and 13Cr tubing were used to maintain well integrity. Processing and recycling of oil-based drilling fluids, flow-back fracturing fluids, etc. were also conducted to avoid environmental pollution. 
By July 2015, Keshen gas field was successfully established with natural gas productivity of 5 billion cubic meters per year. No pollution to the environment and no harm to the ecosystem occurred. No personal injuries were encountered during 27 million man-hours. A road in the mountainous area which is 108km long was built for the gas field and shared by the local residents. Based on Keshen gas field, a gas supply project was established with cooperation with local government, changing the local fuel type from firewood to clean natural gas, which reduces the annual emission of SO2, NO2 and CO2 by 790 tons, 660.27 tons and 61,500 tons respectively. More than 2,000 job opportunities in the gas field were created for the local Uygur and other minority residents. Totally, 41 towns with 4 million residents benefited from this project. The increase rate of the GDP of Baicheng city was doubled with influence of this project. Not only satisfying the local use, the natural gas produced from Keshen gas field is also transported to eastern coastal cities like Shanghai, Nanjing. 
Keshen gas reservoir is an ultra-deep HPHT reservoir with buried depth from 6500m to 8000m, temperature from 150°C to 182°C and pressure from 116 MPa to 136 MPa. With use of many advanced technologies, the reservoir was not only efficiently developed, but with no injuries and no pollution to the environment. It also significantly boosts local community development.

Huangingba shale gas field is located at south edge of Sichuan basin. It has more complex structures, in-situ stresses and natural fracture corridors than its adjacent areas. Tested wells show huge variations of testing results. To identity production controlling factors is essential for optimizing productive drilling and completion in order to boost well productivities further. This paper presents a case study of Huangjingba shale gas field. 
Firstly, production data was analyzed to identify which parameter can be the best indicator of the current well productivities across the field. Secondly, data mining was conducted to correlate this indicator with reservoir quality, completion quality, and drilling and hydraulic fracturing operation parameters. The focus is on those factors that can be managed through drilling and completion optimization. Finally, after the most influential parameters were identified, rigorous simulations using a representative fine model were performed to reproduce observations and investigate their interactions and sensitivities on production. The model was refined from a three-dimensional (3D) field model, which integrates geology, natural fractures, reservoir and geomechanics together. It was calibrated by history matching of pumping history of hydraulic fracturing, microseismic data, and production history. 
Total gas content normalized to pore pressure and porosity can be a single-best factor for sweet-spot identification. Data analysis reveals the best interval for lateral placement. Simulations reproduce this observation and investigate what means can be taken to reduce negative impacts if one stage was outside the best interval. Proppant volume has the strongest correlation with production indicator for this high-stress field although other parameters of hydraulic fracturing are also analyzed. Results of production logging support this correlation. In order to increase effectively placed proppant volume, parametric study of hydraulic fracturing through simulation were completed. Field experiences and measurements suggest that natural fracture corridors can result in early screen-out, constrained stimulation volume, and duplicated stages. Unconventional fracturing modeling was utilized to investigate the optimal design and operational parameters of hydraulic fracturing. 
Our study suggests some key observations agree with the industrial best practices gathered from North America high-pressure shale plays. Yet abundant natural fracture corridors with complex patterns and distributions, formed through multiple tectonics in geological history, may present a unique feature of our field. It is also fundamentally different because of high in-situ stresses with extreme variations of heterogeneities and anisotropies. They require special cares on optimizing hydraulic fracturing in order to develop local best practice.

Wireline formation fluid sampling in weakly consolidated, heavy oil reservoirs has been unsuccessful in appraisal wells in the Bohai Bay area, offshore China. Poor sampling and prolonged testing time were unacceptable from both operational and formation characterization points of view. The challenges involved the production of solids during fluid sampling, contamination as well as poor and unreliable pressure testing. 
An integrated study was conducted to build a fit-for-purpose geomechanical model for the study field using drilling data, well logs, formation and drill stem testing data and sanding observations in several offset wells. An analytical sanding evaluation methodologywas used and calibrated with the observed sand production in the study wells. The calibrated model was then used in a near-real time basis for new wells to optimize the sampling depth points and drawdown pressures to avoid sanding while sampling and also to speed up the sampling time to reduce operation time and costs. The aim was to use higher drawdowns and faster testing while also avoiding intervals where sand-free drawdown may not be possible. 
Using the workflow in new wells has resulted in sand-free sampling at higher drawdownsas well as faster sampling speeds. In contrast, in wells where the rock mechanical aspects of fluid sampling and the root cause of sanding while sampling were not incorporated into the logging and formation testing operations, the sampling failed again due to sanding issues despite the moderate drawdown and slower sampling rate. 
Real-time integrated geomechanical and formation evaluation analysisresulted in delivering sand-free fluid samples, saving 30% rig time, and more successful and reliable pressure and fluid sampling for accurate reservoir and fluid characterization.|","Bohai Bay, fluid sampling, sanding assessment, weakly consolidated, Real time"

Carbonate reservoirs hold 50 to 60% of the world's conventional hydrocarbons and are therefore of major economic significance. Solids production from poorly consolidated carbonate reservoir rocks is a common factor in many wells during production stages and especially in the later life of a reservoir under depletion conditions. While there are several well-estblished technuues to predict sand production in sandstone reservoirs, there are not many field-proven case studies on the applicability of these techniques for solids production assessment in carbonate rocks. In this study, we present a case study on the application of a widely-used sanding evaluation technique in a carbonate gas reservoir, offshore Vietnam. 
We show production, core and well data from several production and appraisal wells in three nearby gas fields to investigate the cause of well productivity reduction in one well through a systematic geomechanical assessment of solids production. The findings are used to optimize gas production in existing wells, determine maximum solids-free drawdown for a planned infill well, and completion decisions for two new development wells to be drilled and completed in 2018 in a field with no production to date. 
Rock mechanics tests conducted on several carbonate samples confirmed the low strength and high heterogeneity nature of the reservoir carbonates. Core-log calibration of rock mechanics paramters revealed reasonably strong correlations between rock strength and porosity logs which were used to generate continuous log-derrived rock strength profiles. Applicability of a well-established poro-elastic sanding predction model for carbonate reservoirs was investigated by a logical solids production analysis in a cased and perforated explorationwell and two open hole production wells. Production, well testsand fluid sampling data were used to calibrate and verify the solids production model. 
Analysis showed no risks of solids production for the weakest reservoirs at initial and current reservoir pressures with the current applied drawdowns, and the drawdown can indeed increase in exsiting wells by another ~200 psi without the risk of solids production. The results however indicated that as the reservoir pressure reduces the solids-free drawdowndecreases rapidly and will approache zero when the reservoir pressure dropsby another600-800 psi. Therefore, solids control measures are essential to prevent solids production at later life of the field. 
The results of the study and historical knowledge of the field reservoir and production were used for completion design of two vertical infill wells with the aim of increasing production from one of the major gas-producing blocks for Vietnam's domestic gas supply. The infill vertical wells will be completed open hole with external gravel pack and screen as the solids control measures.|","Geomechanics, Critical Drawdown, Carbonate Gas Reservoir, Poroelastic Rock Failure, Solids Production"

Sisi-Nubi (SNB) is a gas field located 25 km offshore from the modern Mahakam delta with overpressure reservoirs being found typically in the Sisi Main Zone (SMZ) interval. SNB 3D seismic data indicates a velocity reversal in the SMZ interval, where the overpressure occurs. This velocity reversal has a relation with location of shelf break (distal area), where beyond shelf break the NTG value is sharply decreased. 
In the Mahakam area, overpressure gas reservoirs are one of the main issues in terms of drilling hazards. This has been historically managed by integrating surrounding wells' pressure data to predict the pore pressure profile that would be expected in an upcoming well. In new areas or where pressure data is lacking, it is difficult to predict the PP which can result either in heavier than necessary well architectures or an increased risk of taking a kick. 
An integrated pore pressure study has been carried out on the SNB field in order to provide three dimensional and spatially continuous pore pressure prediction using four different disciplines: sedimentology, reservoir geology, geophysics and geomechanics. The integrated pore pressure model over SNB is contained within a 3D geological model where the Eaton equation can be run using following datasets: sonic well data and sedimentological trend (Well Driven model), upscaled/resampled seismic interval velocity (seismic driven model) and hybrid method as compromise between two data sources involves using the seismic data as a soft trend for the extrapolated well data (hybrid model). 
Based on the blind well test analysis, the hybrid methodology shows the best result in terms of precision and 3D distribution and allows a continuous prediction of pore pressures even where there is poor well control. However, the others two methodologies could be used as an alternative when the available data is limited. 
This methodology gives a new approach with more integrated information in 3D pore pressure modeling that improved the classic pore pressure prediction in field Scale and/or basin scale. However, with the remaining uncertainty and discrepancy between the DT well scale velocity and the DT seismic velocity, and considering all detail well events important inputs (Gas evolution including long connection tests, kick, pressure test, HC bouyancy and other drilling events), collaboration with a strong 1D Pore Pressure synthesis will give a comprehensive result.|","3D Pore Pressure Model, Sisi Nubi, Mahakam, Drilling Hazard, Overpressure"

Geothermal energy is one of fast growing renewables resource in the world. Demand for renewable resources leads to increase of geothermal drilling activities. Well cost contributes up to 40 % of total geothermal project cost. Drilling in geothermal faced many challenges due to its natural characteristics. The most common problems are lost circulation and pipe stuck. Highly fractured zone is the ideal spot for geothermal production. Lost circulation is common in highly fractured formation. Stuck pipe is another problem. Stuck pipe can lead to extra cost of lost-in-hole and fishing operation. Water played an important role in geothermal drilling, not only to keep the wellbore pressure but also to cool down the temperature. 
This paper shows some severe cases of lost circulation and pipe stuck in geothermal drilling. All of the data are taken from geothermal drilling projects in Indonesia. The cases of lost circulation can be divided into two major type based on the location, shallow and deep lost circulation. Each has different technique to overcome lost circulation. Two cases in pipe stuck presented in this paper are the most severe incidents in geothermal project in Indonesia.

A simple yet accurate approach to integrated asset modeling of a complex deepwater dry gas field in the east coast of India is presented here that involves the use of a multi-tank material balance model. 
The field shown here has wells having multi-zonal completion with multiple contacts and perched water. Matching well-wise watercut with multiple water breakthrough events while simultaneously obtaining a good match of declining well pressures has historically been a challenge in this field. In this paper a novel and robust solution to this problem of simultaneous water cut and pressure matching has been presented through the combined use of fractional flow curves and analytical water breakthrough matching. Issues with the modeling of the pressure drop of pipelines and wells which are starting to liquid load and are flowing in the unsteady-state regime have also been addressed in this IAM model. 
A multi-tank MBAL model was built using partially connected tanks which was enhanced with the use of compaction correction to both permeability and inter-tank transmissibility. Well-wise fractional flow curves were used for water rate prediction. Wells, chokes and pipelines were modeled and history matched to field data in GAP. Pressure drop calculations were calibrated to loading curves generated from OLGA.

Efficiency, cost, and corresponding well performance are the primary concerns of multistage completions for tight oil and gas development.

Technology comparisons in a specific field help to identify the preferred solution for its reservoir and well construction features, so as to set guidelines for future improvement and planning in similar applications. 
Daji field is in the southeastern part of the Ordos basin. Comparing with the central part of the basin, the main formation here has relatively poor reservoir qualities, so it is expected that horizontal wells with multistage completion may help to unlock the production potential via better reservoir contact. Two different completion systems were installed in adjacent wells, one with a dissolvable plug-and-perf system, and the other with a coiled tubing activated sliding sleeve system. The purpose of the project is to evaluate the novel technologies and identify preferred options for future horizontal wells. 
Although adjacent, the two candidate wells perform differently during the execution phases. Continuous multistage pumping operations were conducted for both wells, while on-site execution found the dissolvable plug-and-perf system demonstrated much higher efficiency. 
Both completion methods are relatively new as multistage stimulation applications.

The rapid progress in fracturing technology pushes the oilfield development to bigger scale, The traditional Multi-stage fracturing technology such as ball fracturing, quick drillable bridge plug fracturing have problems like limited fracturing stages, high operation risk and high later operation cost etc. Multistage fracturing technology based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) was developed, it overcomes the shortcomings of traditional fracture tools, but the low tag recognition rate, speed limitation and complicated structure limit its further application. A new generation active tag control Sliding sleeve Fracture tool is developed. This fracture tool is composed of vacuum energy storage system, electric control direction valve, sliding sleeve, microcomputer control system, battery group, RFID antenna and active tag. The vacuum energy storage system provide power for the open and close of the sliding sleeve, the operating pressure is the union of the surface fracture pressure and the head of the liquid, which can be controlled on the ground. Electric control direction valve controls the oil flow direction and control the opening and closing of the sliding sleeve. The antenna works only in low power mode and picks the signal from the active tag. The active tag ball contains micro battery inside and signal producing system, it will be wake up by a special instrument before lower into the well, the battery will sustain the tag work for at least 30 minutes. The active tag signal can be picked up by the antenna at 100% success ratio and without speed limitation. During the fracturing process, the active tag will be dropped in the well to control the opening and closing of the sliding sleeve in any specific fractured interval. After fracturing, pressure wave is applied to open all the sliding sleeves and the production operation begins. Compared to the first generation RFID control sliding sleeve, the Active tag control sliding sleeve has relative simpler structure, more compact dimension, longer battery service life, more reliability and control flexibility, which is more suitable for the oil field fracture application.

The object of the work is to study the factors influencing the formation of the void space of a carbonate reservoir in order to predict reservoir properties, as well as to implement the typification of rocks according to the degree of their transformation and the creation of appropriate recommendations for prediction of reservoir properties. 
The article considers sedimentation processes and secondary transformations as well as the influence of these processes on the formation of a void space and the distribution of reservoir properties of carbonate rocks of the Upper Silurian and Lower Devonian deposits named after R. Trebs and A. Titov, which calls for a complex consideration of all factors affecting porosity and permeability, as well as reservoir connectivity and the application of a targeted approach if the influence of the afore-mentioned factors increases. 
Methods for prediction of reservoir properties are based on identifying the range of factors influencing filtration-volumetric characteristics of rocks, their ranking in terms of their impact, as well as the establishment of remote and direct methods for their detection. This, during the first stage a sedimentary model of the Deposit was created and depositional factors controlling void space were identified. 
Further, in the course of a detailed layer-by-layer description of the core and petrographic observations a number of secondary changes were identified, including dolomitization, cementation, compaction, fissuring and clay alteration. 
Also, the influence of sedimentation processes and secondary changes on reservoir properties of rocks was studied and recommendations for their prediction were given. 
Depending on the degree of influence of secondary transformations on the void space and properties of the reservoir, all the studied rocks were divided into three groups: |Carbonate rocks that retained their primary properties. In this case, the filtration-volumetric characteristics control the sedimentation conditions to a greater degree. The collector is unchanged or practically unchanged by secondary processes. 
In this case, the prediction of the properties can be based on the data obtained through direct sedimentation modelling, determining the relationship between the facial heterogeneity and filtration-volumetric characteristics of the reservoir. 
Carbonate rocks that partially lost their primary properties. The empty space of such reservoirs is modified due to the influence of secondary processes (mineralization, leaching, dolomitization and others). 
In such rocks, the in the reservoir changes can be detected by analysing the core scales. Petrophysical studies help in monitoring and predicting of heterogeneity by means of petrophysical classification and the heterogeneity data can afterwards be reconstructed basing on the geophysical data coming from the whole range of wells. 
Carbonate rocks that completely lost their primary properties. In such rocks, there is a significant change in the reservoir. The connection between the distribution of reservoir properties and the facial heterogeneity is very weak or practically absent. 
Prediction of properties should include studies performed on a larger scale (seismic) and must be normalized in accordance with the production well performance indicators (well production rate, the falling rate of production). |Thanks to the obtained data, approaches were revised in the modelling and distribution of filtration-volumetric characteristics and their connectivity.

Refracturing is used in many producing wells to improve well productivity, which falls over time. Well rate/pressure performance analysis indicates that in some cases a significant improvement of well productivity is observed after refracturing. Fracture reorientation is a possible reason why well productivity improves. It is important to run a forecast of fracture reorientation after refracturing. Completing this task will help develop an approach to a better selection of candidate wells for refracturing. 
This paper shows results of numerical modeling of well rate and pressure performance before and after refracturing for cases when properties of the ""old"" fracture improved and for a case of fracture reorientation after hydraulic fracturing (HF), i.e., for two (the ""old"" one and the ""new"" one) perpendicular fractures. Results of numerical modeling made it possible to estimate the contribution that the improvement/recovery of the ""old"" fracture properties make into the well inflow as well as the contribution resulting from the existence of two fractures. Further, the production pressure analysis of field data for wells where repeated HF jobs were performed was made. The occurrence of fracture reorientation in all considered examples was checked in the geomechanical module. The analysis of the impact, which different reservoir values, Yung module have upon the possibility to redirect the fracture during refracturing, was performed in the geomechanical module, too.|",""

Unconsolidated reservoirs on Kikinda oil field cause sanding issues, which complicate exploiting of the wells. As a result, predicting critical depression above which intensive sand production commences becomes substantial problem to solve. 
1D-geomechanical wellbore stability models were used as a tool to evaluate critical depressions on production wells. The fundamental complicacy in modeling was the poorly preserved core, so that it was impossible to conduct rock strength tests. Therefore, the approach to solve inverse problem approach was investigated. It allows determining formation strength from completions, historical production data and production initiating tests. 
Input data for modeling included standard set of logs (resistivity, gamma, neutron, acoustic (compressional wave velocity)); shear wave velocity recovered by means of a neural network, mini-fracturing data was used in matching the value of minimum horizontal stress. The correlation between the strength of uniaxial compression and elastic modulus was derived from matching the modelled profile of cavities with caliper log in conjunction with historical data. 
There were two ways to confirm the models. The first was by production initiation tests on pre-targeted depressions for new intervals along with sand production monitoring. The second was by calculating depression and comparing with predicted value for previously perforated intervals (where data was available), that is retrospective analysis. 
According to historical data, the wells equipped with filters and gravel pack systems have 1000 days less mean time before failure (MTBF) than the wells that flow freely on subcritical depressions. Moreover, filters, presenting supplementary obstacle for fluid, often result in high skin values up to 40-80. At the same time, to reduce risks of needing the next workover gravel packs are being installed on the vast majority of the wells. It is possible to indentify relatively firm intervals with high critical depressions and design their completions excluding the installation of filtering equipment. As a result, well performance could be improved. 
Conducted evaluations juxtaposed with production tests showed that solving the inverse problem approach allows utilizing geomechanical models in critical depression estimation for pay intervals. The main uncertainty of the technique is associated with low accuracy of forecasts for intensively flushed intervals. Supplementary studies on how high watercut influences rock strength was beyond the scope of the project. 
To sum up, the approach of solving the inverse problem was introduced to predict sand production problems for the complex F on Kikinda oil field. The methodology incorporates rock strength determination based on caliper log and production history data. The advantage of the technique is the possibility to carry out evaluations even in the absence of core geomechanical tests data.|",""

This paper demonstrates the approach to field development that involves geomechanical expert analysis at early stages of planning and development. One of the most important problems raised today by geomechanics experts is late involvement of geomechanical analysis and review in the field lifecycle and its usual occurrence only at the development stage. Such approach might lead to a significant reduction in the spectrum of solutions and opportunities to be used in drilling and subsequent production. 
The need for geomechanics was identified early at the stage of the field development plan preparation for the V. Filanovsky Field, the largest in the North Caspian Region. Mindful of the complexity of the geological and drilling conditions of the field area, geomechanical modelling was conducted a 3D geomechanical model was built that made it possible to estimate the borehole stability of the designed wells. 
The 3D geomechanical model served as a ""foundation"" for preparation of a field Basis of Design. It helped to identify the key elements: well design, optimized well paths taking into account the geology and unstable intervals, potential risks, multilateral well sidetracking points, drilling mud type and mud weight, etc.

Within the framework of the article, detailed comparative study of Russian normative documents (GOST) and international standards (ASTM) related to elastic properties and rock strength was done. In the article, strength and weakness analysis of existing methods of core sample testing was done and necessity of their revision was shown. It was demonstrated that rock strength characteristics, such as uniaxial compression strength (UCS) and angle of internal friction (FANG), determined following GOST’s procedures, do not always meet the requirements of geomechanical modelling. 
The results gathered within the scope of the study could be used as methodological foundations for triaxial compression tests (TXC). The described technique of core sample testing implies confining pressure values different from those in GOST procedures; this allows specifying the values of UCS, FANG, and elastic constants measured by core sample tests. In addition, an algorithm was developed to determine strength characteristics based on results of reinterpretation of strength failure envelopes, also known as rock strength passport, compiled according to GOST.

The vector of the oil and gas industry development shows an intensive increase of investments into drilling. Oil-based mud (OBM), in conjunction with new drilling technologies, which have recently been used primarily in complex wells and offshore, are now becoming an effective solution for mass drilling on land where existing technologies have already been developed and proved to be effective. Nevertheless, these decisions have reached their technological limit and do not allow to obtain the expected returns under the new conditions. 
OBM in addition to the unsurpassed drill-in quality, it allows keeping high borehole stability and drilling efficiency. Its advantage is the possibility of re-use and a minimum of wastes. In mass drilling, this reduces its cost and makes it competitive with WBM. This approach has a reverse side - with repeated use of the mud, a fine-solid phase accumulates and rheology grows up at each subsequent well. Control of these processes by standard solids control equipment is practically impossible, as it is impossible to remove the accumulated amount of colloidal phase by traditional mechanical method (centrifugation). An alternative, to some extent, allowing reducing it is dilution, which affects the volume and cost of the OBM. 
Currently, a new technology for recycling is the effective solution for controlling solid phase in OBM and the level of ecological danger of drill cuttings: combination of centrifugal drying system for drill cuttings and removal of the colloidal phase by a chemical-mechanical method using a high-performance centrifuge. This solution was implemented as a part of a campaign to drill horizontal wells of lightweight construction at the Prirazlomnoye field of OOO RN-Yuganskneftegaz. Optimizing the well design involves combining two intervals with different gradients of reservoir pressures and fracturing into one. In conditions of high rates of penetration and a requirement to have minimum operations for hole cleaning, this approach imposes significant restrictions on the operating range of equivalent circulating densities and requires careful planning of each element of the drilling system. The application of OBM allows ensuring stability of the wellbore and optimal conditions for operation of bottom hole assembly tools. A narrow range of operational ECD requires stable parameters of mud throughout the drilling process. 
The use of recycling technology has made it possible to achieve significant results:  
Significant decrease of low gravity solids content; 
Reduction of wastes to the pits; 
Solids control efficiency increase above 90%; 
Significant OBM cost reduction (more than 2 times). 
Stable mud properties while drilling when it is reused several times. |The article describes solutions, achieved results and the way, how in the current conditions of increasing requirements to technology and the increase in the complexity of the wells, integrated solutions for OBM cleaning allow to provide technical, ecological and economic justification of using high-tech and expensive drilling fluids for mass drilling.|",""

Nowadays, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) injection methods are very popular due to its simplicity and effectiveness in increasing the recovery. The water alternating gas (WAG) injection method shows higher sweep efficiency and recovery than the one-phase fluid injection. However, extremely high injection pressure will fracture the wellbore. Moreover, the saturation alteration changes the rock mechanical properties and stress values around the wellbore. The purpose of this study is to study the effects of saturation alteration on wellbore stability.

As a result, predicting critical depression above which intensive sand production commences becomes substantial problem to solve. |1D-geomechanical wellbore stability models were used as a tool to evaluate critical depressions on production wells. The fundamental complicacy in modeling was the poorly preserved core, so that it was impossible to conduct rock strength tests. Therefore, the approach to solve inverse problem approach was investigated. It allows determining formation strength from completions, historical production data and production initiating tests. |Input data for modeling included standard set of logs (resistivity, gamma, neutron, acoustic (compressional wave velocity)); shear wave velocity recovered by means of a neural network, mini-fracturing data was used in matching the value of minimum horizontal stress. The correlation between the strength of uniaxial compression and elastic modulus was derived from matching the modelled profile of cavities with caliper log in conjunction with historical data. |There were two ways to confirm the models. The first was by production initiation tests on pre-targeted depressions for new intervals along with sand production monitoring. The second was by calculating depression and comparing with predicted value for previously perforated intervals (where data was available), that is retrospective analysis. |According to historical data, the wells equipped with filters and gravel pack systems have 1000 days less mean time before failure (MTBF) than the wells that flow freely on subcritical depressions. Moreover, filters, presenting supplementary obstacle for fluid, often result in high skin values up to 40-80. At the same time, to reduce risks of needing the next workover gravel packs are being installed on the vast majority of the wells. It is possible to indentify relatively firm intervals with high critical depressions and design their completions excluding the installation of filtering equipment. As a result, well performance could be improved. |Conducted evaluations juxtaposed with production tests showed that solving the inverse problem approach allows utilizing geomechanical models in critical depression estimation for pay intervals. The main uncertainty of the technique is associated with low accuracy of forecasts for intensively flushed intervals. Supplementary studies on how high watercut influences rock strength was beyond the scope of the project. |To sum up, the approach of solving the inverse problem was introduced to predict sand production problems for the complex F on Kikinda oil field. The methodology incorporates rock strength determination based on caliper log and production history data. The advantage of the technique is the possibility to carry out evaluations even in the absence of core geomechanical tests data.|","Document Type

In mostmodern models and simulatorsfor the hydraulic fracture growth, only stress contrast is taken into account correctly. For the distribution of elastic moduli, a simplified model for averaging the elastic characteristics over crack height is used, in which a composition of several media with different elastic moduli is replaced by one medium with average characteristics. 
In this paper, a more accurate method for crack opening evaluation is found, which takes into account the contrast of the elastic moduli of rocks. The problem of the elastic-strength problem was solvedwith the apparatus of singular integral equations. The obtained result is compared with the analytical solution for the widely spread averaged elastic moduli model. It is revealed that the averaged model gives a smoother profile of the crack. 
The problem is solved within the assumptions of the plane theory of elasticity and the mechanics of brittle fracture. The medium is assumed to be homogeneous in each separate layer, with contrast of Young's moduli, Poisson's coefficients and stresses between adjacent layers. For the brevity, fluid pressure along the vertical contour of the crack is assumed to be uniform, as in the Pseudo3D model. The problem is solved by means of singular integral equations in which the pressure is equal to the integral of the fracture's opening derivative with the kernel of the equation. The contrast of the elastic moduli does not allow an analytical solution of the problem, in contrary to the case for a completely homogeneous media, which has been observed in classical works. 
The contrast of the elastic moduli leads to a sharper distribution of the opening in height, in comparison with that predicted by a simplified model of averaged elastic moduli. In media with higher Young's moduli, the actual opening of the fractureis lower, and in media with lower moduli the opening is higher than model ofthe average elastic moduli predicts. Thus, in a multilayered medium, local narrowing in the vertical crack profile is possible, which hinders the passage of proppant into the productive interlayers lying above and below the initiation pay layer. Also, significant deviations are possible for the area of the crack profile, which can significantly affect length due to material balance. To predict the growth of a crack, not only investigations of the productive interval are important, but also the clay bridges separating the target layers, are needed.|",""

The tight oil is usually developed by horizontal well with volumetric fracture, using depletion type of drive.

However, as the decrease of the permeability and productivity of wells, high decline of produced liquids and reservoir pressure is observed by laboratory and dynamic data, which is called stress sensibility effect. This paper presents an integrated method to supplement formation energy and prevent the stress sensibility. 
The method mainly involves laboratory and numerical model. Firstly, to investigate the possibility of using areal water injection method, two cases are simulated in laboratory. One is simulated as square five-spot well pattern, and another one is horizontal well pattern. Both injector and producer are horizontal well. The injector can be instead of vertical well with large scale hydrofracture for cost saving. Finally, numerical simulation with Non-Darcy flow is carried out. The agreement is obtained with numerical simulation and laboratory. 
This new method is applied to Chang-7 tight oil in China, with the lower formation pressure factor about 0.8. The reservoir's mid-depth is around 2000m. The tight oil is currently under primary depletion development with an annual production declining rate higher than 50% at the first year.

The Achimov oil and gas bearing formation is encountered in nearly the entire West Siberian basin. These sandstone reservoirs form multiple lens-like structures. More than 100 oil, gas, and condensate deposits were discovered in the Achimov formation. Many of them huge, and the one located in the Samburg-Urengoy zone is enormous. There are gas and gas-condensate bearing formations within the upper Achimov interval; some Achimov operators also have encountered the oil-rims in the lower Achimov layers. The formations have sandstone beds with shale interbeddings. Even though a shale layer divides oil from water, it is not hydrodynamically isolating the layers over most of the field. The underlying waters limit the possibility of fracturing completions in the lower Achimov formation. Thus, the primary focus has been on the development of the cost-effective and innovative drill-in and clean-up optimization techniques to improve horizontal well performance. 
A properly designed reservoir drill-in fluid and precise control of its properties are essential to drill and complete horizontal wells and prevent formation damage issues that hamper production. Key requirements, application criteria, design decisions, advantages and limitations, main features and field application results are analyzed based on Urengoy field. 
Extensive lab testing, computer modeling, and hydraulics simulations were performed to consider temperature and pressure conditions of the Achimov formations. The main features of developed oil-based drill-in fluid (OBM) formulation are discussed with respect to local field and reservoir specifics, including wellbore stability, equivalent circulating density (ECD) management, and reservoir damage. 
The large-scale implementation of OBM fluids in the Yamal region is an ongoing, unique project with an extensive amount of lessons learned and ""now how"" technologies included from an engineered drilling system approach [7, 27].

Identification and quantification of in-situ stress barriers is a crucial part of every hydraulic fracturing design and treatment programme. The absence of stress barriers may lead to significant vertical growth of the fracture, creating a channel between the oil-bearing intervals and potential undesirable water-bearing formations. 
This paper presents a case study where the in-situ stress profile in a tight oilfield in West Siberia was re-calibrated. The original stress profile, which was based on core analysis, gamma ray and acoustic data, indicated the stress contrast was enough to contain the fracture within the producing layer. Unexpectedly, high water cut between 60 to 70 % was reported in the horizontal wells, where multi-stage hydraulic fracturing was performed and the source of water production was uncertain. 
Consequently, straddle packer microfrac testing was conducted in one well to create a more detailed and better-constrained stress profile in the target oil-bearing formation as well as in the bounding shale above and below. The data obtained indicated very little stress contrast between the production layer and the surrounding shale layers. The revised stress model differed significantly from what was typically used in West Siberia. The updated hydraulic fracture model showed that excess height growth into the surrounding shale barriers was likely, and breakthrough into the water-bearing layer located 50 to 70 meters above could explain the high observed water cuts in the treated wells. 
Assuming a uniform stress profile along the lateral, the hydraulic fracture design was then optimized to decrease the risk of breakthrough into the water zone. The optimized treatments involved low-viscosity fracturing fluid and also a reduced amount of proppant per stage used in the treatment. The optimized hydraulic fracture treatment was performed in several horizontal wells, which saw a reduction in the initial water cut to below 10%, and also experienced an increase in oil production. This demonstrates the importance of having reliable stress measurements for hydraulic fracturing design.|",""

This paper will present the integrated extraordinary solutions founded during Extended-Reach Drilling (ERD) campaign on Lebedinskoye oilfield, which is located on the Northern East shelf of Sakhalin Island. 
As a green field, Lebedinskoye had a high level of geological uncertainty. Specifics of location made the well profiles complex - with a high Directional Difficulty Index – DDI (SPE ref. 59196) up to 7.2 and ERD ratio up to 2.94. Island logistics imposed critical constraints to the project planning. 
Rosneft and Schlumberger established the goal to optimize the well construction time to bring additional savings in the period of industry downturn. At the same time, a project team set ambitious goals to plan and execute operations to a safe and high quality standard. 
An integrated approach was deemed essential for success of such complex project. Integration provided a seamless interface bridging multi-discipline solutions and technologies to ensure high quality planning together with risk management. 
Several technologies in the project were implemented for first time in Russia. A ""point the bit"" rotary-steerable system enabled drilling the 17 <U+00BD>"" section in the one run of 2168m. A non-cemented liner eliminated the additional cost and time for a cement job as well as the potential impairment of the pay zone. The project team successfully run floated 9 5/8"" casing to the final depth and eliminated major risks of the campaign. The Lebedinskoye was the first time the client implemented advanced LWD tools for deep reservoir mapping. In the result, 97% of 1962m horizontal section placed in the target zone, which became a new record for the Client. 
Finally, integrated approach, new technologies and solutions reduced well construction time by 25% as compared to similar offset extended-reach wells and made the project economical efficient in the period of downturn.|",""

Main producing horizons of the southern license block of the Priobskoe oil field are low-permeable sandstone formations AS10–AS12. Here, horizontal drilling and multistage stimulation (MSS) involving hydraulic fracturing have proved to be an effective way of field development. Full-scale testing of the channel fracturing technology has become the next stage of MSS optimization. This paper is dedicated to analyzing the efficiency of this method based on data from 40 wells. 
Centered around creation of channels inside the fracture, the new method of hydraulic fracture allows better reliability of proppant placement without conductivity restraint; this is achieved by pulsing the proppant on surface, and use of fibers. Moreover, the channel fracturing technique provides significant savings in materials needed for a stimulation job – particularly, up to 45% of proppant and up to 20% of fluid – accelerating bringing-in of the as well as reducing the environmental footprint. The screenout risk is mitigated by pulsing the clean fluid and using fibers while using higher proppant concentrations at the same time. 
Over the course of three years, more than 240 channel fracturing jobs were executed in 43 wells. This paper contains a detail analysis of performance of the wells put on production with implementation of the new MSS technique, compared to neighbor wells where conventional stimulation techniques were used. The wells are divided into groups, e.g. by fracture direction (transverse and longitudinal) and water content in the area, i.e. water-free sections and high water cut sections. The obtained production data proves that wells stimulated with channel fracturing show at least the same efficiency than wells where conventional fracturing was used, and involve better utilization of less resources. 
The project described in this paper is the first experience of mass use of channel fracturing technique for horizontal wellbores in Russia. Lessons learnt from this experience, efficiency analysis, and applicability criteria defined in the scope of this project will help assess the potential of this new technique for other oil and gas fields in Russia.|",""

Currently, Some online tools, which is helping engineers either chemical or mechanical engineering calculation, easly can be accessed as a multifunction toolbox. They do not only propose a rapid online entree to a wide-ranging of formula utilized in the subject area, but also provide serving as a useful tool for professionals which do not have any access to a complete library or who do not have accustomed skills to locate the formula needed. 
Ultimately, the aim of virtual Petroleum Engineering Toolbox is to deliver comprehensive equations and formulas as well as the technical description of 1000 principles to academic communities and industrial segment either petroleum engineering background or not, within an appropriate accessible source in 24 hours a week. 
Two core portions of Petroleum Engineering Toolkit are Equations and Technical Guideline / Perusal highlighting over a thousand calculations in Enhance Oil Reservoir, Broad-spectrum Reservoir, Production Optimization, Laboratory Experiments, Well Test Analysis, Well Stimulation, Production/Injection Logging, Thermodynamics concepts, PVT, Fluid flow behavior, Drilling and economics. 
Thus far, field data, neither offshore nor onshore are really difficult to access, not only due to located in a remote area, but also the limitation of information sources. Hence, the Technical Guideline/Perusal section is providing the end user in a very convenient manner to serve as a library for reference tables, graphs, and diagrams in petroleum engineering section. 
The user friendly and useful guideline illustrates the theory behind the equation used in calculations. By the interface from open source technology, Petroleum Engineering Toolbox is manufactured utterly. PHP Version 5.2.4 and Apache 2.4.9 Web Server build the server side connection. MySQL Version 5.5 creates the database. To navigate the HTML document and generate AJAX request, JQuery Version 1.4.1, a JavaScript library is utilized. And MathJax opensource library make the formula representation. 
The current interface of Petroleum Engineering Toolbox is easy and friendly for the user through any PC, Mac, tablet or any mobiles devices. Further, it can be also retrieved by iPhone and iPad as a portable application. 
In the past, this kind of complete and universally-available toolbox is not obtainable in the oil and gas industry, thus petroleum engineering toolbox is the first tools which is aiding the oil and gas professionals and the academic municipal. 
There are many online petroleum engineering tools that run speedy online access to a wide spectrum of equations. Eventhough, these tools are as a convenient tool in the area of interest for professionals, they have a very limited ability due to only have a few equations for very specific tasks. This makes it very challenging for petroleum engineering students and professionals to locate an equation, since there is not available reference tables and charts all-in-one place. The inconvenience of access to an equation of need when required is a burden for students when they learn, for professionals when they want to remember and use it. It may be even harder for non-petroleum engineers to find the equations of need from many references or books. 
An easy and convenience of single-point access to almost all petroleum engineering equations with the plotting feature is available through Petroleum Engineering Toolbox. It is an easy learning and practice tool for engineers with backgrounds other than petroleum engineering. Currently, 1000+ equations are gathered from 50+ petroleum engineering books and now they are all published online at ptlbx.com. Users can select/search for a formula and enter the inputs to calculate the outputs. They can also plot the results for further analyses.

Geomechanical failure parameters are best estimated from core samples, which are not always available. To address this, numerous relationships have been proposed that relate rock strength to parameters measurable with geophysical well logs, but they tend to have limited accuracy or low range of applicability. This paper aims at overcoming the limitations of the existing techniques by using different artificial intelligence techniques (AI). 
The data used in this study are usually available from the commonly conducted well log surveys (neutron porosity, gamma ray and bulk density) as well as the sonic log. Data sets from 10 wells in carbonate formations and 30 core samples were used to build a simple, yet powerful, model that can predict the rock failure parameters from well logs. The derived model is working because it considers many factors that affect both the rock strength and elastic moduli. 
Three artificial intelligence techniques; Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used to predict three geomechanical failure parameters, namely: the angle of internal friction (friction angle or FANG), unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and tensile strength (TSTR). For each parameter, the three AI techniques were implemented to train AI models and then unseen data was used to validate the models. 
From the three tested AI techniques, ANN model gave the best results and out-performed the other models obtained using ANFIS and SVM for the FANG prediction, with correlation coefficient of 0.98 and AAPE around 5.8%. The ANN model was programmed in a (white box) manner, which allowed the successful extraction of the weights and biases from the network to be easily used. For TSTR and UCS prediction, ANFIS models performed better than ANN and SVM. The two ANFIS models had correlation coefficients of 0.99 and Average Absolute Percentage Errors (AAPE) of 4.9% and 3.7% respectively.|","Tensile strength, Geomechanical Failure Parameters, Friction Angle, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS)"

This paper presents the application of a Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) method based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a technique developed by Saaty, T.L. (1980, 2008), to improve definition of field development projects at early stages, when facing the challenge of selecting the best development option from multiple alternatives. 
In order to rank efficiently various alternatives of development we apply AHP to technical quantitative or qualitative criteria, like EOR options, well types options, facilities options, transport options, operability and reliability, subsurface conditions, as well as economical quantitative parameters, such as Life Cycle Costing (LCC). 
The AHP methodology supports decision-making using pairwise comparison of two or more criteria previously established by experts. For the application of this method, it is necessary to decompose the problem into several steps. In this paper, we show how to apply the method for the selection of a development option for a heavy oil field. 
AHP applied to Front End Loading (FEL) staged-gate process increases the probability of success in generation of economic return and mitigation of major capital project risks faced during the early stages of the project. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this method with respect to other more conventional techniques. 
The objective of this work is to introduce the use of the AHP methodology for the FEL screening phase with a simple exercise using information taken from the existing literature.

No two shale plays are the same. Experimental and field data shows that shale formations act differently when exposed to similar conditions. The instability of shale formation is considered one of the major problems facing drilling operations. Bit balling, cutting dispersion, washouts, and stuck pipes are some of the problems faced when drilling shale formation. Only recently, shale formation became a target for hydrocarbon production. Shale plays are the new frontier for drilling and development. When the oil price was high, it was economical to drill and produce from shale formation. Now that the price of oil is relatively low, drilling and producing from shale formation might not be that lucrative. To reduce the cost of developing shale plays, we need to understand the producing shale geomechanical properties. There have been many studies on conventional shale formation and it has helped reduce potential drilling problems in those formations. However, not all shale formations are the same, and solutions that worked with one will not necessarily work with others. That is why we need to conduct studies focused on producing shale. Two producing shale formations were used in this study they are Marcellus shale and Arabian Peninsula (AP) shale. This study is exploring the difference in swelling behavior between the one side of shale core sample that is in direct contact with fluid with the other side of shale that is not in contact with drilling fluid. This is meant to represent the swelling at the wall of the wellbore and the swelling near the wall of the wellbore. Six samples from Marcellus shale and six samples from AP shale were used in this study. Two samples from each formation were used to collect the mineralogy data using XRD/XRF tests and the remaining four samples were used in the swelling tests. For the swelling tests, the samples were half submerged in various drilling fluids where half of the core sample is inside the fluid and the other half hangs above the fluid level. Strain gauges attached to both side collect the swelling behavior continuously for seven days. Results shows that at low swelling levels the back side of the wellbore (near well bore) shrinks while the wall of the wellbore swells. However, at high swelling rate both the wall of the wellbore and near the well bore increase in size following a similar swelling profile.|","near wellbore, shale, swelling, drilling fluid, Unconventional"

West Kuwait's 22-in. section comprises a vertical hole through 3,500 feet of interbedded carbonates varying significantly in compressive strength, and drilled commonly with minimal or no fluid returns. The section is typically drilled with roller-cone tungsten carbide insert (TCI) bits because large polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits are extremely costly and require expensive performance motors to support their generated torque. PDC bits are also at risk of impact damage when drilling through the interbedded formations in this interval. Operators tend to apply higher drilling parameters while in the lower compressive strength intervals to achieve higher rates of penetration (ROP). Consequently, when the TCI bit enters the following harder formations with the same high operating parameters, it often suffers severe cutting structure damage. The result is reduced ROP. Greater weight on bit is then applied, causing further bit damage and possible sealed bearing failure. 
An engineering project was launched to develop a TCI bit specifically for the interbedded carbonates of this section. The primary challenges of the project were: |Ensure the bit finishes the section in one run 
Improve dull condition of bit coming out of hole 
Surpass current field average ROP consistently 
Maintain efficient cleaning at lower flow rates for drilling in complete fluid-loss scenario |Based on data and experience in drilling the application, an engineering process took place where several designs improvements with potential to improve performance were identified and trialled. Field engineers then worked onsite to identify how to drill the interval with optimal parameters for each sub-layer. The final design included: |Specialized TCI cutting structure for carbonate drilling 
High impact-resistant insert geometry 
Simulated hydraulic efficiency to improve hole cleaning 
Improved high aspect ratio elastomer seals designed to endure longer runs 
Specialized tungsten carbide to improve cutting structure durability |The engineering process yielded a design that successfully drills the complete section in one fast run - the fastest of the section - with an improved field average penetration rate to 63%, saving the operator more than 38% in associated cost for drilling the section. The application-engineered cutting structure enabled the use of lower drilling parameters than normal, thereby improving drilling efficiency and enhancing the post-drilling dull condition from the average of 3-3-BT to 1-2-WT.

Some heavy oils reservoirs present an unusual behavior when put on production under significant drawdown conditions. In these reservoirs, the high formation depressurization increments the recovery factor and accelerates the production rates driven by a solution gas mechanism. Due to the chemical and physical properties of these oils they tend to stabilize the dispersion of gas bubbles, promoting the generation of foam in the oleic phase. This foamy oil when compared with conventional oils result in a more productive response at similar drawdown conditions. The foamy oil phase behavior is the result of a number of complex mechanisms and requires a good understanding on each of them to estimate the potential response of these reservoirs. In this work, the role of key factors that affect the bubbly oil production is summarized. 
To outline the significance of key variables on the performance, a commercial optimization and uncertainty analysis software coupled with a mechanistic simulator is used. The simulator allows a detailed modeling of the physics involved on the generation and behavior of the foamy oils, in which the foamy oil is modeled as a disperse phase of gas bubbles in the oleic phase, including small mobile gas bubbles and larger trapped gas bubbles flowing as discontinuous gas dispersion which affect foam viscosity, compressibility, mobility and relative permeability. Fluid properties used in this work are from Maini (1996). 
The sensitivity and optimization analysis performed in this work on key reservoir variables and well operational parameters shows the significance of each factor on the production response. The relative importance of each variable is reported in tornado diagrams. Results showed that a strong approach on handling the reservoir unknowns are as crucial as the control of operational parameters from reservoir management point of view. 
Nowadays the foamy oil behavior and its favorable production response are not totally well understood. Solutions have been proposed but they are still controversial and the use of horizontal wells introduces more complexity in the production operations. In this work is provided an in-depth optimization and uncertainty analysis to outline the role of each major parameter affecting the production response and the recovery efficiency in this type of reservoirs using horizontal wells.|","heavy oil, foamy oil, optimization"

Most drilling-related incidents are caused by unstable boreholes, whether they are caused by lost circulation, packoff, or stuck BHA and/or casing. One of the main objectives of this study was reduction in drilling incidents and associated Non Productive time (NPT) while drilling wells in a particular area of Kuwait, where often extremely challenging environments were faced due to wellbore instability arising from tectonic stresses, associated faults, fractures, complex structures, and anomalous pore pressure. Additional challenges were presented by a complicated and highly deviated well design, where planes of weakness of the formation being drilled and their relative angle with respect to the well path become crucial factors in assessing stability of the borehole. Multiple failure mechanisms such as stress induced wellbore instability, invasion of drilling fluids into weak bedding / micro-fractures and osmotic sensitivity, were found to be the root cause of wellbore instability across reactive shale formations especially during drilling of highly deviated wells. 
In lie of these challenges, a comprehensive study was conducted to overcome the wellbore stability issues and investigate feasibility of drilling Ahmadi wells of Kuwait at high deviation. Correct mud weight (MW) prediction was one key factor during the drilling stage to keep the wellbore stable and deliver good borehole geometry (Figure 1). The key objectives of the study were to define a safe MW program for the vertical and deviated sections of the planned well by conducting a wellbore stability study and to determine a real-time strategy to mitigate and-or manage wellbore instabiity problems as they arise. 
The scope of work included root cause analysis of drilling events, development of mechanical earth models (MEM) for offset wells, integrating sections of the MEM from the offsets to the planned well trajectory, and a safe MW program for planned well. 
The paper describes the process of optimizing the drilling practices based on geomechanical outputs, to overcome serious drilling hazards and application of real time geomechanical monitoring for successful drilling. This application promises to open the prospect of drilling similar wells without complications and reduce NPT in Kuwait.|","Drilling, Geo-Mechanic, Reduce Non productive time, Stress Regime"

Because the reservoir matrix is very tight, the natural fracture system is the main pathway for gas production. Meanwhile, stimulation is still required for most production wells to provide production rates that sufficiently compensate for the high cost of drilling and completing wells to access this deep reservoir. Large depletion (and related stress change) was expected during the course of the production of the field. The dynamic response of the reservoir and related risks, such as reduction of fracture conductivity, fault reactivation, casing failure etc., would compromise the long-term productivity of the reservoir. |To quantify the dynamic response of the reservoir and related risks, a 4D reservoir geomechanics simulation was conducted for KS reservoir by following an integrated workflow. The work started from systematical laboratory fracture conductivity tests performed with fractured cores to measure conductivity versus confining stress for both natural fractures and hydraulic fractures (with proppant placed in the fractures of the core samples). Natural fracture modeling was conducted to generate a discrete fracture network to delineate spacious distribution of the natural fracture system. In addition, hydraulic fracture modeling was conducted to delineate the geometry of hydraulic fracture system for the stimulated wells. Then, a 3D geomechanical model was constructed through integrating geological, petrophysical and geomechanical data, and both the discrete fracture network (DFN) and hydraulic fracture system were incorporated into the 3D geomechanical model. A 4D reservoir geomechanics simulation was conducted through coupling with a reservoir simulator to predict variation of stress and strain of rock matrix as well as natural fractures and hydraulic fractures during the field production. At each study well location, a near- wellbore model was extracted from the full-field model and casing and cement were installed to evaluate well integrity during production. |The 4D reservoir geomechanics simulation revealed that there would be large reduction of conductivity for both natural fractures and hydraulic fractures, and some fractures with certain dip/dip azimuth will be reactivated during the course of the field production. The induced stress change will also compromise wellintegrity for those poorly cemented wellbores. The field development plan must consider all these risks to ensure sustainable long-term production. |The paper presents a 4D coupled geomechanics simulation study applied to an HP/HT naturally fractured reservoir, which has rarely been published previously. The study adapted several new techniques to quantify the mechanical response of both natural fractures and hydraulic fractures, such as to use laboratory tests to measure stress sensitivity of natural fractures, integrating DFN and hydraulic fracture system into 4D geomechanics simulation, and evaluating well integrity on both the reservoir scale and the near-wellbore scale.|","4D Geomechanics, Long-term Productivity, HPHT, Tight Gas, Natural Fracture"

KOC planned to drill a challenging horizontal well in Ratqa field where there are serious limits to build deviation, reservoir navigation and hole instability. The candidate well was targeted into early Cretaceous Zubair reservoir, a highly laminated sand/shale sequence. Objective of this horizontal well is to target two highly depleted thin reservoirs (UCH and LCH) within Zubair, with a thick shale layer in between. While navigating the wellbore optimally through sweet spots within the reservoir units is a challenge, the risks of shale instability and differential sticking are other expected challenges during drilling. The target reservoirs sequence is around 8-10ft thick and there is 8ft thick interbedded shale separating the two sands. How to land the well properly inside the upper channel with optimum exposure of two sand units is one concern, and stability of interbedded shale at high angle is another concern. In order to mitigate these issues, pre drill geo-mechanical modelling was performed to predict the require mud weight and real time geo-mechanical monitoring was also carried out in conjunction with geo-steering. The resistivity contrast of these sands is around 70<U+03A9>m versus 10<U+03A9>m, which would give 9ft – 10 ft depth of detection (DOD) for azimuthal resistivity tool. This service would help to place the well optimally inside the reservoir and also provide early warning before exiting reservoir. The well was landed 7ft TVD inside the upper channel and continued building to 90° inclination in the lateral section with mud motor in order to build faster and also to prevent any stuck up with high configuration tool. The re-logged section confirmed that the wellbore already reached the base of upper channel. It was then decided to continue drilling to lower channel by crossing the interbedded shale using 9.5ppg mud weight in order to keep options open for running Inflow Control Devices (ICD). However, tight hole, over pull, pack-off, bit stalling, bigger size cavings etc. indicated poor wellbore condition. As drilling with lower mud weight already initiated shale instability it was then attempted to gradually increase the mud weight to avoid further deterioration of hole condition. It was then decided to sidetrack the section with a mud weight of around 12+ppg, as recommended by the pre-drill model. In addition, mud formulation was adjusted to block micro-fractures/invasion into shale to reduce differential sticking risk. Real-time wellbore stability monitoring was carried out including LWD log responses, cavings characterization, hole condition monitoring, etc. The wellbore was built to 89° inclination upon entering the lower channel as per correlation and was maintained inside the lower channel. The lateral section achieved 1,120ft long footage with a 78% exposure inside the sweet spot. Integrated real-time geo-steering and geo-mechanics successfully helped placing the well optimally in the target sands without hole instability.|","Geo-steering, Geo-mechanic, Real Time, Cavings"

This article attempts to summarize measures that are required to be adopted in order to have safe drilling practices mainly in unstable shale formation and have a smooth landing section in target reservoir below the shale. For the last three years in North Kuwait, the number of geo-steering jobs increased significantly and some encountered problems while drilling Wara shale that may end up in losing tools and eventually the hole itself. This paper focuses on information regarding problems encountered in geo-steering jobs and the best practices followed to achieve goals. Stratigraphically, Wara shale lies underlying Tuba and overlying Mauddud carbonates. It has thickness variation in between 80 to 110 feet TVD. Wara shale in North Kuwait is generally unstable and very sensitive to mud properties and creates instability of the wellbore. A wide range of drilling data from well placement jobs were documented and analyzed in order to get an idea of the behavior of shale section, how to drill safely across this layer and mitigate possible risks that may harm the well as well as the tool. Detailed scrutiny was done to compare the drilling parameters, log responses, inclination and trajectory direction between stable and unstable wells. The results were integrated with regional tectonic regime in the area. The methodology and learning curve continuously improved with assimilation of new drilling data and information. Integrated study on all aspects in drilling that involving geo-steering engineers, drilling team, geologists and field engineers on-site has enhanced the ability to understand the situation in the hole and ultimately able to provide faster decision. It was observed that there is strong relationship of building inclination, direction of the well and mud weight in some wells when crossing Wara shale. Wells that have East - West or Northwest - Southeast direction tend to be unstable when compared to wells in North - South or Northeast - Southwest direction. Low incident angle (high inclination) will mostly cause more problems in drilling than high incident angle due to longer section of exposure as well as overburden. Compressional tectonic regime of the area dictate the recommendation of well trajectory should go towards maximum horizontal stress. Recommended to cross it with low inclination and consequently approaching the target reservoir with high dogleg severity tool was to maintain the stability of the wellbore. These findings will help service provider and client to make proper planning, adopt best practice, take proper decision and thereby successfully execute well operations.

Oil and gas operating companies are always concerned with evaluating the reserve of their assets. Evaluation process of hydrocarbon reserves requires a full understanding and knowledge of technical and non-technical aspects regarding the nature of reservoir, available technology and economic conditions as well as others. Recovery factor (RF) is the most important parameter in evaluating the reserve of new fields. 
Several techniques are currently available for estimating oil recovery factor, the accuracy of those techniques are highly affected by data availability which is mainly related to the field age. Some of the techniques are highly accurate but they require lots of production data, hence, their applicability early in the reservoir life is restricted. Others could be applied earlier, but on the other hand, they have very low accuracy. 
In this paper ten parameters (original oil in place, asset area, net pay, initial reservoir pressure, porosity, permeability, Lorenz coefficient, API gravity, initial water saturation and oil viscosity), which are usually available early in the life of the reservoir, are used to estimate the oil recovery factor through application of four Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques namely: artificial neuron networks (ANNs), Radial Basis Neuron Network (RNN), ANFIS-2 (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System, Subtractive Clustering), and SVM (Support Vector Machines). Data from 130 sandstone reservoirs were used to learn the AI models, and then an empirical correlation was developed based on the ANN model. The suggested AI models and the developed ANN-based correlation were then tested in other 38 sandstone reservoirs. 
The results obtained showed that ANN-based correlation successfully predicted the recovery factor based on early time data only with absolute average percentage error (AAPE) of 7.92%, coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9417, root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum absolute percent error (MAE) of 3.74 and 24.07%, respectively. ANN-based empirical correlation over-performed RNN, ANFIS-2, and SVM models in term of AAPE, MAE, and RMSE for testing set. Comparison of the recovery factor predicted by the developed equation with three available correlations showed that the developed equation predictability is about 5 times better that the most accurate correlation (of the currently available ones) in term of AAPE for predicted RF of the tested 38 reservoirs.|","Artificial Neural Network, Recovery Factor, Artificial Intelligence"

For well over a decade, we have been using depth-of-cut (DOC) control to control the aggressiveness of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits. In recent years, the ability to change the aggressiveness has been an effective way of mitigating vibrations, in particular for stick-slip. The amount of fixed DOC control is determined for a particular formation or DOC, but it can limit performance in other parts of the well, or not solve vibration problems in multiple formations. This paper demonstrates that having a PDC bit with innovative self-adjusting DOC control can mitigate these vibrations to enable improved performance through each section of the well. 
In the selected application in South Texas, torsional vibrations or stick-slip can be problematic, damaging the bit or downhole tools and reducing drilling performance. Performance metrics and dull conditions were collected to prove the presence of torsional dysfunction. Current bit styles have acceptable performance; however, the bit life has limitations regarding vibrations. Mitigating vibration is required to improve the performance of the bit and system. The addition of the self-adjusting DOC control feature changes the bit aggressiveness continually during the drilling operation, helping to achieve optimal performance. 
When the self-adjusting feature engages with rock for steady state drilling, the feature gradually retracts, controlling the DOC to find the optimal exposure of the element for the current drilling parameters and formations. As dynamic instabilities occur, the self-adjusting feature reacts at fast time scales to mitigate the event. Comparing this technology to the offsets, the drilling data at surface show improved performance with 196% distance drilled while the downhole data show there is a smooth drilling response throughout the run. 
A bit with the innovative self-adjusting DOC control can adapt to the downhole variables, prolonging its life and helping operators achieve their goals more efficiently, or with minimal driller intervention. Previously validating the concept in research wells it is now demonstrated in field trials with a reduction in torsional vibrations.|","Vibrations, Adaptive, Stick slip, Self-adjusting, Depth of Cut control"

Choke management strategies vary significantly among operators and no rigorous methodology exists for properly selecting choke sizes when constraints are placed on completions, wellbores and fluid pressures and velocities. Bringing a well on production too fast may significantly compromise productivity or even result in completion failure with particularly severe implications in offshore developments. Examples of constraints placed on bean-up strategies include, limiting the maximum drawdown to minimize the risk of sanding or proppant crushing. This paper presents a methodology for translating such constraints to the required choke sizes and durations i.e. a specific bean-up strategy that will respect the constraints placed on the system. 
In this study, we propose a coupled wellbore-reservoir model that performs dynamic nodal analysis using integrated models for surface facilities, wellbore and reservoir simulators and allows an operator to select choke sizes as a function of time. Illustrative examples of the method are shown for a conventional and an unconventional well. Results indicate that the choke schedule strongly depends on both the reservoir and wellbore properties. As a result, empirical and general guidelines should not be used across the board. Instead a quantitative analysis is recommended for a given set of surface, wellbore and reservoir properties to ensure a successful ramp-up. This study provides an integrated and systematic approach for selecting choke sizes for oil and gas wells.|","Well Management, Choke Management, Bean-up, Sand Production, Flowback"

To maximize production rates and ultimate hydrocarbon recovery from its water drive reservoirs, North Kuwait shifted its exploitation strategy from vertical to horizontal completions. When water broke through, however, remedial efforts were limited, complex, and certainly short-lived since the water moves laterally along wellbore to adjacent compartments. A more effective solution to control the water cone was implemented in a vertical well with good success, but with some operational limits. This completion used a conventional ESP with Y-tool to create a counteractive pressure drawdown just below the Oil/Water contact in an effort to limit the progression of the water cone. The major limitations with this ESP configuration were casing size (can only be used in 9<U+215D>"" casings and larger), and rate restrictions (limited to 4,500 BPD injection rate, beyond which shroud erosion is expected). Cone Control technology, is to create a pressure drawdown (<U+0394>P), just below the OWC marginally more than the <U+0394>P across the perforated interval within the Oil leg. This drawdown retards the progression of the water cone, and can best be achieved using an inverted, bottom-discharge high-volume ESP. Inverted ESPs were selected after the limited success achieved from utilizing a shrouded conventional ESP with Y-tool in the original Cone Control completion. Inverted ESP’s eliminated both constraints, and added the advantage of being shorter and more compact, suitable for wells with higher dogleg severities. The Inverted ESP is used for subsurface disposal, and can be injected into an underlying hydrocarbon-free aquifer, or reservoir requiring pressure support.|","Water Coning Control, Inverted ESP"

Oklahoma has been at the center stage of induced seismicity. Water-disposal activities have been attributed to trigger the increasing number of seismic events. The objective of the study is to provide a simple diagnostics method and procedure for safe water-disposal operations. A comprehensive suite of scenarios and parameters has been analyzed that affect water disposal. Prognosis based on this study will lead to safe water-disposal operation without the adverse effect. 
A suite of reservoir models involving water injection helped understand disposal-well performance. The well operational limits correspond to disposal-zone fracture gradient. The modified-Hall analysis is employed to ascertain the point of departure from normal injection behavior. Limiting cumulative injected volumes are determined and investigated for various scenarios from simple to increasingly complex subsurface conditions. This investigation includes studying the effects of disposal-zone storativity, compartment size, conductivity, formation compressibility, heterogeneity, and natural fractures. Additionally, we explored the effects of communication with overlying producing zone, communication through completion anomaly, seal integrity and fluid complexities. 
This study illuminates an overall understanding of disposal-well performance through various scenario analyses. A relationship of disposal zone fracture gradient and limiting cumulative injection volume is established. For a fracture gradient of 0.7 psi/ft, this limiting pore-volume injection is less than 2%, which corresponds well with the conventional wisdom learned from CO2 injection-well performance. The relationship of disposal-zone compartment size, established with rate-transient analysis, with limiting cumulative injection volume is formulated. Analyses from the various statistical design of experiments reveal the important variables that may affect disposal-well performance. The disposal-well operation can be devised in real time using the modified-Hall analysis that can reveal the departure from normal injection-well behavior. Factors accentuating the departure from normal behavior include disposal-zone storativity, formation compressibility, and seal integrity. Situations, where pressure release through leaks or communication with an adjacent formation takes place, will naturally accommodate a larger volume of disposal water. Also, we learned that limiting cumulative injection volume and not injection rate (assuming injection pressure gradient is less than the fracture gradient) triggers a departure from normal injection behavior. 
Using a suite of numerical reservoir models and the reservoir-monitoring tools involving modified-Hall and rate-transient analyses led to a comprehensive understanding of disposal-well performance. This study found a relationship of fracture gradient with limiting cumulative injection volume and identified key variables affecting the disposal-well behavior. These findings led to a smart and safe disposal-well monitoring scheme, which will help disposal-well management become more economic and environmentally friendly.|","Modified Hall Analysis, Reservoir Flow Modeling, Water Disposal Well Performance, Induced Seismicity"

The confirmation of critical downhole events helps operators make effective real-time decisions during hydraulic fracturing operations. A relatively new monitoring system has been gaining traction in the industry, using high resolution pressure and acoustic signals to help operators visualize downhole and surface events. This paper briefly describes the real-time visualization system (RTVS) monitoring operation and focuses on case histories from the field. 
Traditionally, downhole events such as fracturing sleeve shifts are verified by surface pressure signatures. Gaps may occur when conventional pressure signatures are ambiguous, if, for example, the bottomhole pressure is low. The monitoring system provides a visual and audible representation of downhole and wellhead events, using a unique and specialized array of electronic sensors. The monitoring system operates alongside conventional pressure measurement, as a separate and independent verification. The data stream can be integrated with conventional monitoring data. 
Through a series of both onshore and offshore case histories, the system is proven to be able to confirm both pressure and non-pressure events. The paper includes detailed field examples utilizing the visualization system. Specific examples include determination of ball launches from the wellhead to confirm launch equipment and procedures. Fracturing sleeve operations can be verified, including balls seating and sleeves shifting. Failed ball launches at surface or unshifted sliding sleeves downhole can result in a costly loss of entire treatment stages or inadvertent overstimulation. Equally important are troubleshooting issues, which, if correctly diagnosed, allows the problem to be effectively addressed. Themonitoring system has detected equipment failure, including pump and casing breaches. Also, the paper will address limitations of the monitoring system; some types of events are not clearly identifiable. 
The RTVS is deployed on surface, can be set up in 30 minutes, and has a small footprint. Real-time monitoring adds an extra layer of information, enabling better completion optimization, and reducing uncertainty and downtime. Continued data collection will provide theindustry with a better understanding of unseen events that will contribute tofuture operation and technology development.|","Monitoring, Real-Time, Acoustic, Fracturing, Completions"

A series of sandstone faulted anticline gas reservoirs were produced after the Himalayan movement. Faults were the main channel to transport natural gas from Jurassic coal-bearing formation to sandstone reservoir in Cretaceous. Simultaneously, the faults play a key role for fluid flow during the development of the gas field, but it is a huge challenge to evaluate the influence of faults on fluid flow quantitatively with depletion. To solve this problem, an integrated research combined geology, geomechanics and gas reservoir engineering was conducted. Firstly, 6 geological factors associated with connectivity and sealing properties of faults was analyzed to determine the critical factors among them. Secondly, based on 4D geomechanical modeling and 3D stress analysis of faults' plane, a calculation model of faults geomechanical activity index (FGAI) was built. Finally, the relationships between faults geomechanical activity and performance of gas field development were investigated to understand the influence of faults' mechanical behavior on production and water invasion during development in Kelasu gas field. |It is shown that faults geomechanical activity has profound influence on the performance of Kelasu gas field. 1.The faults geomechanical activity is one of key factors to control permeability, which can indicate the difference of permeability around faults and permeability variation during depletion. 2.With the depletion during exploitation the in-situ stress regime in Kelasu gas field changed from strike slip to normal faulting, and the heterogeneity was also gradually increasing which two resulted in the variety and complicate of faults' geomechanical activity. 3.It is found that there is a good correlation between the faults geomechanical activity and water invasion. The water breakthrough was early and gas-water interface rose fast near the faults with higher geomechanical activity index during depletion. 4.The complex relationship between stress field and faults system resulted in a great difference of faults geomechanical activity index in different location of reservoir. FGAI (Faults geomechanical activity index) is the highest in western reservoir, followed in turn by the eastern, northern, southern, so there is the most rapid uplift of gas-water interface in the western, followed in turn by other parts. Based on evaluation of faults geomechanical activity in this area, this reservoir could be divided into three blocks by different water invasion risk. Areas and gas wells with high risk water invasion were warned in advance. 6.For optimization of well placement, we found that FGAI is relatively low in northwestern reservoir, the fault sealing ability is high, the research provided one of basis for the placement of a new gas well. |A fault geomechanical activity index (FGAI) model for the gas reservoir with complex structure and high pore pressure and high in-situ stress was established.

Analysts regard the fracture injection and falloff test known as the diagnostic fracture injection test (DFIT) as a reliable tool to quantify formation closure stress, leakoff coefficient, formation permeability, and pressure. The recent analytical DFIT model for before and after closure enables matching the pressure falloff for abnormal leakoff behaviors, and quantification of many more formation parameters than traditional DFIT models. However, the model design addressed only the falloff data after shut-in, and many express concerns that net pressure implied by the falloff is inconsistent with the injection pressure behavior. This paper provides a model capable of matching both injection and falloff pressure behavior. 
The pressure falloff model is capable of quantifying essential pressure values including, in order of occurrence, instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP), minimum fracture propagation pressure, one or more closure stress values, minimum stress, and pore pressure. The early pressure response represents the dissipation of three kinds of friction, wellbore, perforation, and near-wellbore friction, each of which are quantified, and which together comprise the difference between the pressure at the end of injection and the ISIP. Presence of tip extension enables quantification of the minimum fracture propagation pressure. The minimum stress is consistent with the final closure stress. Subtracting the closure pressure and friction pressure losses from the recorded or calculated bottomhole pressure provides the fracture net pressure. The model match for injection pressure behavior incorporates the same pressures and consistent values for 2D fracture geometry and leakoff coefficient. 
The global match confirms not only the estimation of formation and fracture properties from the pressure falloff analysis, but also the pressure distribution along the wellbore, through the perforations and the near wellbore, and in the fracture during and after injection. In particular, by matching both injection and falloff, the model incorporates friction pressure losses that can explain apparent excessive net pressure. 
The match with both injection and falloff pressure variation addresses concerns that the net pressure implied by the falloff model match cannot be consistent with observed injection behavior. When the pressure difference between the final DFIT pick for closure stress and the pressure at the end of injection is very large, the reason may be large friction pressure losses and/or tip extension. Design for the main fracture treatments could consider an altered perforation strategy to reduce friction losses and/or reduce cluster spacing to address very low effective permeability likely consistent with tip extension and confirmed by the after closure match.|","step rate test, ISIP, net pressure, Friction, DFIT"

To reliably quantify changes in the in-situ stresses due to oilfield exploitation, it is necessary to start from a representative description of the subsurface and simulate both fluid movement and geomechanical effects. For this purpose, a new 3D ""hybrid"" grid is presented. This grid accurately honors geological features, with no unwarranted simplifications, while being ideally suited for geomechanical simulators and the new generation of flow simulators. 
The new 3D Hybrid Grid is dominated by hexahedrons arranged in a structured manner except around faults, where it is made up of tetrahedrons. The grid is constructed from the underlying geological model and the sealed fault network. Both structured (hexahedrons) and unstructured (tetrahedrons) parts follow stratigraphic deposition information. For geomechanical simulations, each compartment is considered as an independent mesh part allowing sliding effects along the faults. At the interfaces between the hexahedrons and tetrahedrons in a fault block, shared nodes are used to ensure stress equilibrium and displacement continuity. 
Uncertain states of stress and unforeseen changes in the integrity of the subsurface can have grave economic and environmental consequences. Understanding these helps mitigate development risks, and optimally develop the field. Today, geomechanical studies are not routinely performed and are often based on simplified descriptions of the subsurface. With this new Hybrid Grid, we propose to combine a reliable representation of subsurface with state-of-the art rock mechanics to assess how reservoirs respond to drilling, completion and production. Simplifications in either can lead to incorrect assessment of risks or production forecasts. The grid presented in this paper aims at honoring geology accurately while also being optimal for numerical computations. The zones of tetrahedrons enable the inclusions of even the most complex faulting systems, while the structured hexahedrons precisely follow the stratigraphy and are most efficient for geomechanical simulations. 
The gridding technology presented enables a coherent representation of the subsurface for constructing geological models for simulating both flow and geomechanics. Although such meshing schemes exist for modeling manufactured objects, these are difficult to apply to geological formations; our approach now enables them by guiding the meshing using the chronostratigraphic parameterization of the subsurface. It will allow engineers to routinely include the effects of stress changes during production and will build confidence in development plans.|","geomechanics, unstructured grids, fault reactivation, reservoir modeling"

Pore diameters for shale reservoirs are on the order of few nanometers which become even smaller during production because of rock deformation. This dynamic interaction between pore fluid pressure and rock stress affects the phase behavior in unconventional reservoirs. In this paper, a new mathematical formulation of fully-coupled geomechanics and compositional dual-porosity model was used to determine the impact of rock deformation and confinement on the nanopore fluids as well as their effect on the production performance of Eagle Ford formation. The formulation presented was derived from our multiphase poroelasticity model which was an extension to the single-phase, single-porosity Biot's linear poroelasticity theory allowing to characterize the rock deformation and pore diameter reduction using the bulk modulus of the matrix-fracture system. 
Changes in reservoir pore pressure and rock deformation that cause the pore diameter to reduce increases the capillary pressure in the pores which affects the bubble-point pressure suppression and significant shift in the phase envelope, favoring longer period of single-phase production. It was observed that not taking rock deformation into account will lead to over estimation of production, whereas ignoring the effect of pore confinement would underestimate the production forecast. In an example field study based on Eagle Ford reservoir, an increase of around eight percent in cumulative oil production was achieved when the effect of rock deformation and confinement was included in the compositional model compared to the case where only the rock deformation was included. On the other hand, if only pore confinement effect was included in the simulation runs, four percent of increase was achieved.|","Compositional Modeling, Shale Reservoirs, phase shift, Phase Behaviour, Poroelasticity"

The conventional approach to flow units’ characterization according to Amaefule et al. (1993) is based on the Kozeny-Carman equation. Although, the Kozeny-Carman equation has been used widely for relating permeability to other properties of porous materials, it suffers from the assumption of non-interacting flow tubes. In this paper, the effects of pore connectivity, valve action of pore throats, and cementation factor are considered by an interacting bundle of tortuous leaky capillary-tubes model of porous media to derive an improved equation of permeability. The parameters of the power-law form of this equation are related to pore connectivity measured by the coordination number using the functional relationships derived from the phenomenological rate equations. The validity and accuracy of this approach is established by comparison with directly measured core data. This approach allows for incorporation of various data within a single, compact, and simple power-law equation over the full range of porosity and permeability. The power law exponent of the leaky-tubes model is shown to deviate significantly from the unity assumed in the Kozeny-Carman equation. While the Amaefule et al. (1993) approach characterizes the reservoir flow units solely based on a flow-zone indicator (FZI) parameter, the present improved approach adds a power-law exponent which allows for enhanced flow units’ characterization using two porosity dependent parameters. The analysis of the permeability vs. porosity data demonstrates that the power law flow units’ model alleviates the deficiencies of the classical Kozeny-Carman equation. This model adequately approximates the actual flow patterns in porous media because it allows interactions and cross-flow between the capillary hydraulic paths.|","Permeability, Reservoir Flow Units, Interacting Bundle of Leaky Tubes"

Real-time analysis of drilling mud loss data is an effective tool to characterize the size, distribution and permeability of natural fractures. The estimated properties of natural fractures can then be used to modify the drilling fluid properties and design remedial mud loss treatment to stop further drilling fluid loss. Moreover, characterization of natural fracture provides crucial information for the design and application of reservoir stimulation operations. 
In this paper, we present a theoretical model to simulate the invasion of the drilling fluid into natural fractures. Mathematical modelling was performed for two types of rheology constitutive models which are commonly used for drilling fluids, namely Bingham Plastic and Herschel-Bulkley. The fluid leak-off into the formation is modelled using Carter's model. Moreover, a simplified local elasticity equation is used for the fracture width variation due to fluid pressure. A forward finite-difference numerical scheme is used to solve the pressure drop equation. The developed model is then validated against well-known analytical solutions and numerical simulations. Parametric studies were conducted to evaluate the impact of the fracture deformability, formation leak-off properties, drilling fluid rheology, and the pore fluid contribution. Finally, the output of the developed model is compared with the field data of a welldocumented mud loss incident. 
The obtained results indicate that the incorporating the effect of the fluid leak-off may significantly increase the rate of mud loss volume. Therefore, for highly permeable formations (such as carbonates), considering the impact of the fluid leak-off effect seems necessary for a realistic characterization of the mud loss problem. Fracture deformability affects the mud loss volume, with higher deformability leading to a larger mud loss volume. Also, the numerical results confirmed that the rate and magnitude of mud loss volume is significantly affected by the rheological properties of the drilling fluid, in particular the yield stress. In contrast, the effect of pore fluid seems relatively negligible for typical formation fluid types. Comparing the results of our simulation with mud loss field data shows that the developed model can accurately predict the rate and total volume of mud loss into the fractures. Moreover, it shows that incorporating the impact of the fluid leak-off and the fracture stiffness may significantly affect the fracture width prediction. Therefore, these factors should be considered to obtain an accurate estimate of the natural fracture aperture.|","Naturally Fractured Formations, Mud Loss in Natural Fractures, Natural Fracture Characterization, Lost Circulation Material Selection, Lost Circulation Control"

In hydraulic fracturing operations, permeability is enhanced when fractures are created and/or stimulated by injecting a highly pressurized fluid. In addition, mechanical response of the rock changes because of permanent modifications in the structure and properties of the rock after failure. In order for engineers to accurately predict results of hydraulic stimulation projects, mathematically rigorous and numerically efficient models of fluid flow and geomechanical deformation in fractured porous media must be used in computer simulations. Some of the earlier approaches address the problem of fluid flow through fractured media with mathematical models that are either too simplistic or too expensive computationally and are not compatible with the available petroleum reservoir simulation platforms. In this work, a reservoir simulation framework is developed using a sequentially coupled numerical scheme of flow, deformation and poromechanical damage to study variations occurring in the fractured rock properties and state variables as a result of hydraulic stimulation. We numerically simulate injection-induced permeability enhancement and plastic deformation as well as post-stimulation softening behavior of the rock by considering the stimulated rock as a mechanically damaged configuration, the properties of which are modeled using an effective continuum model. We study how the flow and mechanical properties of fractured rock, namely permeability and stiffness, change by virtue of hydraulic fracturing, and we investigate the dynamics of pressure distribution and stress state with time. The sequential nature of the proposed coupling framework lends itself to easy integration with reservoir simulation and prediction tools.|","Hydraulic Fracturing, Reservoir, Flow, Geomechanics, Permeability"

Drilling the reservoir section in the Sagari field (Peru) presents many challenges, such as wellbore collapsing in the extremely mechanically unstable Shinai formation; differential sticking in low-pressure, high-permeability sandstone reservoirs; and total losses due to the presence of natural fractures. This paper describes how the implementation of automated managed pressure drilling (MPD) and managed pressure cementing (MPC) techniques allowed overcoming those challenges in a remote location where logistics and equipment mobilization is an additional challenge. 
The preliminary geomechanical study indicated that an equivalent density (ED) of 10.5-lbm/gal was required to maintain wellbore stability, while 10.8-lbm/gal could not be exceeded due to the risk of differential sticking. Additionally, eliminating pressure variations in the mechanically unstable Shinai formation would prevent wellbore collapse. The MPD strategy for drilling the original 8.5-in hole section and sidetrack consisted in using an automated MPD System to maintain the ED profile within the 10.5 to 10.7-lbm/gal window along the open hole and a near-constant pressure of 10.5-lbm/gal in the most unstable Shinai formation at all times. 
Due to its reduced footprint, this automated MPD equipment package could easily be airlifted by helicopter to the remote rigsite. 
The MPD strategy was implemented as per plan; it successfully prevented wellbore instability and differential sticking and contributed to the excellent condition of the wellbore. Indeed, the production liner was run down the 2,700ft of open hole smoothly in less than six hours and later well testing revealed that the mechanical skin factor in the reservoir section was equal to zero. 
When drilling the last feet of the sidetrack with an ED of 10.5-lbm/gal, a natural fracture was encountered; it was immediately detected by the MPD Coriolis flow meter located at the well returns, allowing for a quick response and curing losses rapidly. However, this further reduced the operating window size. MPC allowed using a statically underbalanced drilling fluid, while ensuring well integrity and preventing wellbore collapsing during cement placement. The estimated ED on bottom was monitored in real-time and losses were successfully prevented. The coupling of the wiper plug on the landing collar was observed as per plan, and successful zonal isolation was later confirmed by cement bond log (CBL) and casing integrity test (CIT). 
In addition to the application of managed pressure techniques in the production section, MPC of the intermediate 9 5/8-in casing was performed as a contingency measure, as the reduced annular flow area between the two casing strings and the narrow pore pressure -fracture pressure window would not allow cementing the casing conventionally.|","Lost Circulation, Wellbore Instability, Managed Pressure Cementing, Differential Sticking, Managed Pressure Drilling"

Using the permeability reduction function, production degradation caused by fines migration is simulated in a detailed single well model. From previous research, it is understood that fines migration won't start until the flow velocity is greater than the critical velocity. Through many long-term core flood tests (extended fines migration test), we conclude that the permeability damage induced by fines migration is a function of the pore volume throughput. To address these observations the numerical model is updated such that the interstitial flow velocity is tracked in each individual cell. When the interstitial velocity is greater than the critical velocity, the cell's permeability follows the permeability reduction trend obtained from laboratory data. If the flow direction is reversed, fines migration damage will be recovered. A detailed 3D model is constructed to study the fines migration effect in each part of the wellbore (perforation, fracture etc.) and reservoir. As expected, fines migration starts near the perforation where flow velocity is highest. Depending on the permeability decline rate, the production asymptotes to a constant value after a certain period of time. Both the decline rate and the ultimate residual permeability have a strong effect on the final production. Sensitivities were run to study the effect of fines migration in different completions. As the author's understanding this is the first time that laboratory-based fines migration data is incorporated into a reservoir simulator to predict the production decline using experiment-based fines migration functions. This workflow will help reservoir engineers to predict the damage caused by fines migration, predict production decline and plan remediation.|","Fines migration, Productivity decline, Reservoir simulation, Deep water reservoirs"

This paper experimentally investigates the damage evolution (or the deformation process) induced by externally applied stress on unconventional shale samples. The focus is to understand the physics behind the complex failure process occurring at the micro-scale, and thus provide useful information on the macro-fracture mechanisms of unconventional shales. We perform the compression tests along with the acoustic emission (AE) measurement on cylindrical rock samples selected from Berea sandstone (BS), Eagle Ford (EF) and Marcellus formation. Tests are conducted under the same stress condition: uniaxial unconfined compression test and triaxial compression test with a confining pressure of 10 MPa. AEs are continuously collected to characterize the progressive damage process. The axial stress, axial and radial displacement are also recorded during experiments. Shale samples are drilled perpendicular or parallel to the beddings. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is used to measure the mineralogy and clay content. Prior to geomechanical testing, the high-resolution micro-CT imaging system is used for quality assessment of rock samples and characterization of microstructure and fracture presence. 
All samples studied exhibit distinct characteristics of AE counts. In Berea sandstone, AE counts initially increase slowly with the axial strain, and then surge dramatically after reaching the yield stress point. This is consistent with the observed stress-strain behavior: a linear elastic part followed by the inelastic deformation till the rock fails. Compared to Berea sandstone, shale samples show a different characteristics of AE counts. AEs resulting from EF vertical sample monotonically increase until the sample fails, while three stages of AE activity are observed in the horizontal sample: initial increase followed by a stage of quiet period (no AE events), and increase again. Marcellus samples behave just the opposite: three stages of AE events are observed in the vertical sample, while monotonically increase in the horizontal sample. AEs are also observed to be affected by the test condition: different from the triaxial compression test, Marcellus vertical and horizontal samples have a similar trend in AE counts during the uniaxial compression test. Both initially increase in AE activity with the axial stress, and after a certain stress, a surge in AE activity is observed. The observed discrepancy of AEs can be due to the complexity of shale mineralogical compositions, pore geometry and thin layer structure. More detailed laboratory experiments are necessary to understand the physics behind the complex failure process and AEs occurring at the micro-scale in unconventional shales.|","Ultrasonic measurement, Acoustic emission, NMR, Stress-induced damage, Unconventional shales"

Refracturing of a horizontal well is a method to restore the productivity of the well in unconventional reservoirs after the expected production decline. Placement of new fractures in a system that has been already depleted poses new challenges for operators. These challenges are due to the altered stress zones resulting from the expected pore volume depletion and corresponding pressure decline. In this study, refracturing propagation issues in a horizontal well are studied. 
A fully coupled poroelastic displacement discontinuity model has been developed to study refrac propagation in horizontal wells. Displacement discontinuity is a powerful numerical method for studying hydraulic fracture problems. The model has been verified using available analytical solutions for undrained and drained fracture behaviors. Maximum horizontal stress criterion is used to account for the fracture propagation. Several cases are analyzed using the model. For each set, scenarios that increase the chance of successful refracturing are suggested. 
Results of this study show that pore pressure depletion is the key factor in defining extent and severity of stress redistribution zones in the reservoir. The effect of pore pressure is shown to be asymmetric in horizontal wells between two parallel fractures. It is observed that the stress anisotropy between two parallel fractures decreases and it increases between the tips of two fractures. After a certain time, stress anisotropy in the area between two fractures becomes negative which means that the horizontal stresses orientation is reversed in that area. Placing any new fracture in the stress-reversed area causes an unwanted change in direction of fracture propagation and eventually an intersection between new and old fractures. In addition, because of the stress redistribution, new fracture tends to propagate toward the nearest old fracture in a single well. This tendency increases as pore pressure depletion becomes greater, increasing risk of refracturing failure. A sensitivity analysis is performed on spacing and length of the old fractures to investigate the best possible treatment plan in terms of these variables. 
Results that are obtained by this study give better understanding about propagation of new fractures as well as old fractures in refracturing process. Moreover, it introduces a very efficient method that aids in the design of refracturing processes in depleted horizontal wells.|","Fully poroelastic model, Horizontal wells, Hydraulic fracturing, Displacement discontinuity, Refracturing"

Openhole multistage (OHMS) completion systems have been available for nearly 20 years. Their introduction was primarily linked to improved operational efficiency, achievable through the elimination of redundant operations, costs, and time from the existing application of plug-and-perf (P&P) solutions. However, increased understanding with time has demonstrated that the most effective applications of the approach are those that offer better connection within the reservoir. Examples of such applications include delivery of fracturing within extended reach wells, application to naturally fractured formations, and use of the OHMS systems in offshore or logistically challenged areas. 
The use of an OHMS system has a number of potential advantages for certain applications, not least of which is preservation of the uncemented annulus with extensive direct reservoir access within the completion. One of the major advantages of this geometry is that there is an unparalleled and flawless wellbore-to-reservoir communication in place, immediately prior to fracturing. In hard-rock, high-stress-ratio cased-cemented scenarios, where tortuosity and near-wellbore friction can dominate, an ability to avoid such issues in the first place is an advantage. This is particularly true in those horizontal wells drilled and completed in complex stress regimes. In these cases, a complex connection resulting from perforating can often be detrimental to creation of desired fracture width, making proppant placement challenging and thereby reducing the effective fracture conductivity. 
Within the Khazzan field, in the Sultanate of Oman, such a complex tectonically impacted stress-state exists in the formations of interest, combined with an ancient hard-rock environment exhibiting a wide variance in effective permeability. Early multifractured cased-cemented horizontal well simmediately demonstrated complex fracture-to-wellbore communication behaviour, which was addressed in a number of ways. One of these approaches included plans for deployment of the OHMS as a potential technique to ensure a smoother and simplerfracture-to-wellbore interface. 
This paper will fully describe the experience of the first OHMS completion deployed in the Khazzan field including details on the fracture design, operational execution, surveillance, post-fracture cleanup, and productivity. The paper will particularly address those aspects related to near-wellbore tortuosity, fracture connectivity, proppant placement, and evidence of connection quality. The paper will assess this completion approach alongside previously applied techniques and report on the potential of the approach for more widespread deployment in resolving fracture complexity.|","Multistage, Openhole, Oman, Fracturing, Horizontal"

For a stress-sensitive reservoir, the constant rock compressibility term used in a conventional reservoir simulator (CRS), does not account for change of porosity and permeability. This paper develops a coupled geomechanics and reservoir simulator (CGRS) which accounts for changes in porosity and permeability related to deformation. 
The simulator in this paper adopts a staggered grid finite difference method for fluid flow and displacements. Displacements and pore pressures are placed at centers of faces and grid blocks, which increases numerical accuracy. Four types of nonlinear, coupled equations (porosity, permeability, displacements, and pressure equations) have been derived for use in CGRS. The Newton-Raphson method requires solving all the unknowns simultaneously, a computationally intensive procedure. An alternative is to use the Macro Gauss-Seidel method, which divides a huge nonlinear matrix into several smaller matrices, thus speeding up computations. 
Solutions from CGRS have been validated using two analytical solutions: a one dimensional consolidated reservoir and an idealized reservoir. This validated simulator is used to simulate a 3D reservoir with multiple vertical and horizontal wells. The comparison between CRS and CGRS shows that pressure depletes faster in CRS as compared to CGRS. CGRS results in higher bottom-hole pressure for a constant rate well. Constant rate wells yield a result of 1 to 1.26 times higher bottom-hole pressure than CRS. This shows that neglecting geomechanics effects in CRS can lead to an under prediction of reservoir/bottom hole pressures and production rates. Another powerful function of CGRS is the output of 3D displacements, which cannot be predicted by CRS. After producing for 1000 days, the maximum vertical displacement reaches 0.34 ft. (0.085% of reservoir thickness). Maximum displacements in the x and y directions (lateral displacements) are 4 <U+00D7> 10-4 ft. and 0.015 ft., both of which are smaller than vertical displacement because of fixed lateral boundary conditions. 
Unlike traditional iterative coupled (IC) methods, fluid flow and geomechanics share the same mesh, which solves the problem of numerical instability in two discretization methods used in traditional IC. Also, the change of volumetric strain with respect to time (usually neglected in traditional IC) has been included in the fluid flow equation to better characterize the effects of solids movement on fluid flow. The Macro Gauss-Seidel method was adopted to increase computation efficiency of the simulations. The simulator introduced in this paper has its own data structure for geomechanics analysis which can be incorporated in single-phase, two-phase, three-phase or compositional reservoir simulators.|","Staggered Grid, Reservoir Simulation, Geomechanics, Finite Difference, Coupled Geomechanics and Reservoir Simulation"

The operator is active in drilling deepwater (DW) exploratory, appraisal, and development wells in the central and western areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) where water depths exceed 4,000 ft. In this demanding application, a key step to a successful well is achieving high performance in the large-diameter surface sections of the well. This important segment can start a well ahead of the authorization for expenditure (AFE) or create setbacks and added unplanned costs. Increasing the rate of penetration (ROP) and improving wellbore quality are two essential components for reducing cost of the riserless sections of any deepwater well. 
Verticality must be maintained throughout the 26-in. large-diameter section to reduce casing wear and to ensure torque and drag remains minimal while drilling to deeper depths. The 26-in. hole section is drilled riserless and a high ROP generate additional savings by lowering the drilling fluid cost. The higher percentage of cuttings provides the additional equivalent mud weight so pump and dump (PAD) mud is not required. The increased ROP needs to be achieved with low vibration levels to avoid any bottom hole assembly (BHA) component failure that would necessitate an avoidable and costly round trip. 
The operator has previously drilled with 18<U+215B>-in. hybrid bits in salt and sub-salt formations and has recognized the potential of hybrid bits and their ability to drill fast with stable drilling conditions. Several drilling records have been set in this hole size. Encouraged by the performance gains and better drilling efficiency of initial hybrid bit runs, the operator planned to reduce cost of their riserless drilling section in a batch drilling program in GOM. 
The 26-in. hybrid bit was implemented to batch drill three hole sections, each approximately 3,400 feet long. The operator was able to optimize the drilling parameters for each successive well due to growing confidence in the stable drilling environment. This enabled the drillers to increase the ROP and greatly improve time savings. The three intervals were drilled at ROP of 255, 308, and 379 ft./hr., respectively; breaking GOM field ROP records for each consecutive run with this operator. All three penetration rates have also surpassed the current world record ROP for this hole size. Subsequent 26-in. hybrid bit runs have established consistently higher ROP and have proven to be a significantly better solution when compared to polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits. 
This paper presents the details of the performance improvements achieved through the use of large-diameter hybrid bits, compares the drilling efficiency of large-diameter PDC and hybrid bits, and discusses some important design aspects of the hybrid bit that deliver stability and steerability.|","Hybrid drill bit, Steerability, Verticality, Dual cutting mechanics, Drilling efficiency"

Fracture Calibration Tests (FCT), are strategically used to estimate, amongst other important parameters, reservoir permeability and pore pressure during early appraisal stages of unconventional formations, where estimation of permeability and pore pressure by pressure transient buildup tests is impossible because no flow occurs without hydraulic fracture stimulation. This study investigates some of the idiosyncrasies that have been reported in a large number of FCTs, which make after-closure (AC) analysis ambiguous or inconsistent. 
We recently introduced a novel comprehensive model for FCT analysis, combining before-closure (BC) and AC behavior in a fully consistent way, facilitating the detection of abnormal BC events (i.e. multiple closure and non-linear leakoff) and improving the intrinsic weakness of standalone AC analysis methods. Extensive use of this model on a vast number of shale gas FCTs has revealed the existence of apparent AC anomalies. This paper provides a novel approach to identify and diagnose these apparent anomalies and reconcile them with unique aspects of the tested unconventional shale formations. 
In the AC anomaly that we firstly addressed in SPE-144028-MS, the logarithmic derivative shows only a minimal indication of formation linear flow, showing instead an abrupt transition to pseudo-radial flow. This unresolved anomaly inspired the work presented in this paper, where twenty FCT published case histories were used to study and reveal four distinct anomalies:  – 
AC logarithmic derivative exhibits unit slope, a symptom of horizontal fracture; – 
Multiple closures followed by AC logarithmic derivative that exhibits a late-time ""hook""; – 
AC logarithmic derivative exhibits abrupt transition to pseudo-radial flow with limited or no linear flow; – 
AC logarithmic derivative exhibits an apparent dual porosity ""dip"". |These AC idiosyncrasies have been rationalized and integrated into our established comprehensive model for FCT analysis, allowing a realistic characterization of the geological, tectonic, and wellbore -related geometric signatures that very commonly manifest themselves in all shale formations.|","Shale Gas, DFIT, After-Closure, Shale Oil, Fracture Calibration Test"

This paper presents a conceptual model of the Haynesville Shale which matches dynamic pressure behaviors over periods of 2 to 5 years of all 20 wells investigated. It assumes three stages of productivity deterioration, with matrix permeability declining first, followed by decreasing fracture conductivities and the onset of pseudo-skin effects which increase linearly with time. 
The shale reservoir is simulated as a two-zone repetitive element, consisting of a fractured zone in contact with the wellbore and surrounded by a matrix zone representing the rock unaffected by fracturing. The two zones have different initial permeabilities and permeability-pressure relationships. The permeability-pressure function for the matrix is obtained from laboratory measurements and is the same for all wells. That for the fractured zone is determined by history matching and is well-specific. 
The matrix permeability decreases as soon as its pore pressure begins to fall whereas the decline of the fractured zone permeability only starts below a threshold pressure, and at a time which corresponds to a distinctive behavior on a normalised rate versus cumulative production plot. As the bottomhole pressure decreases further, matching between simulated and observed data requires the introduction of a pseudo-skin factor increasing linearly with time, which could correspond to the effective fractured zone becoming smaller as the pressure declines.|","permeability pressure, shale gas, Haynesville, unconventional, hydraulic fracture"

This paper introduces a novel approach to characterize the stimulated fracture network, and consequently, to optimize the stimulation, wellbore placement, and re-fracturing designs, by integrating the pressure hits captured from passive wellbores on a pad during fracturing operations. If effective, it may also provide a cost-effective alternative to microseismic monitoring. |The workflow initially considers a rigorous data analysis on available pressure hits at each frac-stage in time and space, including the location of pressure events, time of flights to offsetting stimulation, and the magnitude and intensity of pressure hits/falloffs. Streamline simulation, assisted with a hydraulic fracturing module, is then used to match the pressure hits/falloffs in the passive wells. This ultimately provides a dynamic probabilistic 3D map of the fracture network growth, reservoir complexity and inter-well connectivity. The fundamental mechanisms of hydraulic fracturing and the interactions across natural and induced fractures (fracture initiation/propagation/growth) are implemented by means of an advanced coupled hydro-mechanical code, based on distinct element method. |Results from initial data analyses were fed into a hydro-mechanical model, which incorporated the physics of the hydraulic fracturing process, in order to reproduce the pressure hit signatures. An assisted streamline-based technique was used to simulate various scenarios of pressure hit responses to construct a database of standard pressure hit/falloff patterns. This database, compiled into a dynamic 3D map, facilitated a probabilistic approach to calculate a robust estimate range of stimulated fracture network of the pad area. This database can be subsequently used in future stimulation and re-fracturing designs. The backbone of the highly complex fracture network, extracted from pressure hit/falloff data, was found to closely align with high-resolution microseismic data. |Calibration of the hydro-mechanical model using the pressure hit data provides increased confidence in the use of the model to optimize well placement and hydraulic fracturing designs. In the absence of microseismic data, this unique workflow has the potential to deliver real-time on-site monitoring of fracturing operation at a reduced cost and acceptable accuracy, to provide additional statistics on complexity of stimulated reservoir volume, and to offer a better assessment of the likely range of the induced fracture network among horizontal wells.|","Pressure Hit, Stimulated Fractures, Shale Basin, Hydraulic Fracturing"

The work deals with a conceptual geological model creation that is necessary for further geocellular modelling and field development scheme optimization. The object of the study is Lower Jurassic terrigenous formations U15 and U14 of Urman-Archin fields group located in south-eastern part of West Siberian basin. Low quality of these reservoirs requires detailed geological analysis for allocation of the most perspective zones. This work integrates the results of seismic, paleogeographic, palaeotectonic, logging, well testing, macroand microscopic core analyses. It was discovered that the formations were deposited in fluvial conditions. Moreover, the evolution of the river system is observed across the interval of U15-U14 formations – braided streams change to meandering ones. The sedimentary processes determine vertical and lateral lithological heterogeneities as well as the primary distribution of grains of different size characterizing the activity of depositional agent. However, it was found that lithology and grain size is not directly related to the presence of reservoirs, so sedimentary conditions are not the key factor of reservoir continuity. Analysis of diagenetic alternations of the formations’ rocks showed that their compaction influenced reservoir quality and its lateral heterogeneity. In some parts of the studied area the rocks are more compacted, and, consequently, they have lower porosity and permeability. Tectonic movements caused non-uniform rock compaction across the area. In addition, they led to reservoir compartmentalization. There are hydrodynamically isolated blocks, which may influence fluid distribution within the formations and should be considered during development scheme planning. Significant influence of diagenetic alternations on the reservoir properties is not typical for the deposits in terrigenous rocks within West Siberian basin, so this conclusion should be taken into account when analyzing similar reservoirs in this region.|","terrigenous reservoir, post-sedimentary processes, West Siberian basin, diagenesis"

Over the past two decades, Diagnostic Fracture Injection Tests (DFIT) or Injection-Fall-off Fracture Calibration Tests have evolved into a commonly used and reliable technique to evaluate reservoir properties, fracturing parameters and obtain in-situ stresses. Since the introduction of DFIT analysis based on G-function and its derivative, this method has become standard practice for quantifying minimum in-situ stress and leak-off coefficient. However, the pressure decline model that underlies the G-function plot makes two distinct and important assumptions: (1) leak-off is not pressure-dependent and, (2) fracture stiffness (or compliance) is assumed to be constant during fracture closure. Fracture closure is a gradual process that starts when asperities at the fracture tip first come into contact with each other. As pressure declines due to leak-off, more and more of the fracture wall comes into contact. It is important to model this process quantitatively to obtain good estimates of in-situ stresses and leak-off. In this paper, we present a model that accounts for changes in fracture stiffness/compliance as the fracture closes, with leak-off that is dependent on fracture pressure. The model is, therefore, capable of analyzing DFIT data from the end of pumping to days or even weeks after shut-in. 
We first review Nolte's original G-function model and examine the assumptions inherent in the model. We then present a new global pressure transient model for pressure decline after shut-in which not only preserves the physics of unsteady-state reservoir flow behavior, elastic fracture mechanics and material balance, but also incorporates the gradual changes of fracture stiffness/compliance due to the contact of rough fracture walls during closure. This global model allows us to analyze the whole spectrum of DFIT data by bridging before closure and after closure data seamlessly. Analysis of synthetic cases, along with field data are presented to demonstrate how the coupled effects of fracture geometry, fracture surface asperities, formation properties, pore pressure and wellbore storage can impact fracturing pressure decline and the estimation of minimum in-situ stress. 
It is shown that so-called ""normal leak-off"" behavior that is modeled using Carter leak-off is an oversimplification that leads to significant errors in the interpretation of the data. All the before closure analysis conducted under a ""normal leak-off"" assumption should be reexamined cautiously. Most importantly, this article reveals that previous methods of estimating minimum in-situ stress often lead to significant over or underestimates, because of their failure to account for changes in fracture stiffness/compliance correctly as the fracture closes progressively from the edge to the center. Based on our modeling and simulation results, we propose a much more accurate and reliable method to estimate the minimum in-situ stress, fracture pressure dependent leak-off rate and evaluate the compliance of the un-propped fracture.|","Closure Stress, DFIT, Mini-Frac, Before Closure Analysis, Fracture Calibration"

Managing offshore hydrocarbon fields involves costly investments like drilling infill wells or installing compression facilities. A good understanding of the dynamical behavior of the reservoir is required for derisking such decisions. Time-lapse seismic is a suitable monitoring technology, but it involves large operational costs. On the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS), another geophysical method has been in use for two decades: 4D gravity and subsidence surveys, with a cost typically 15% of that of seismic surveys. Field cases show that, in some cases, this technology provides information beyond the reach of seismic within the required timeliness. 
Time-lapse gravity changes at the seafloor are sensitive to changes in mass within the reservoir. As an example, vertical movements of water-gas contacts smaller than a meter can be detected under some circumstances by studying this observable (Ruiz et al., 2015). That is possible because of the high accuracy of the time-lapse gravity measurements, which is at the level of a few <U+03BC>Gal. 
Seafloor subsidence monitoring uses water pressure measurements at the seafloor as a starting point. Once the required tide corrections are applied, the method reaches accuracies of down to 2 mm, depending on the field conditions. This is much better than the accuracy specified by pressure sensor manufacturers, which amounts to typically 10 cm of water for a sensor qualified for 1000 m of water (Ruiz et al., 2016b).|","Reservoir, Subsidence, Offshore, Monitoring, Gravity"

In order to predict productivity and deliverability in shale complex system, it is crucial to understand porosity and permeability relation. Since pore size distribution in shale formations is stretched down to nano-meters, the system response violates the predictions of Darcy's law. Depending on pore size and gas properties, non-Darcy flow mechanisms such as slip-flow, molecular diffusion, and Knudsen diffusion can affect the matrix deliverability. Although there are several models to predict permeability considering non-Darcy flow mechanisms, the impact of formation compaction has been neglected in calculations. However, correcting for pore volume shrinkage seems crucial for improved accuracy in evaluation of hydrocarbon reserve. |In this work, we analyze different flow regimes coupled with effects of pore volume compressibility for Barnett and Haynesville shale plays. The pore compressibility values are calculated based on Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP) data. Using our mathematical formulation, we divide the shale matrix into accessible pores and inaccessible part of the rock (IRP) and characterize pore compressibility values as a function of pressure. |As local pore pressure decreases, formation porosity, pore radius, Knudsen number and thus flow mechanisms are subjected to change with time. Hence, a new permeability model (total permeability) for shale matrix is developed which includes Darcy flow, slip flow, molecular diffusion, Knudsen diffusion, surface diffusion, and last but not the least pore compaction. The impact of pore shrinkage on total permeability reduction is analyzed. |Our results indicate that substitution of accessible pore compressibility with total bulk compressibility can significantly change the production behavior. The results suggest that predicted compressibility values for accessible pores appear to be two to up three orders of magnitude greater than bulk compressibility for Barnett and Haynesville samples. Moreover, effects of pore compaction on permeability during pressure depletion seem significant for the samples studied here.

Modeling of wormholing phenomenon is one of the challenging research problems due to the complexity of the process which requires coupling of multi-phase fluid flow, species transport, geochemistry, and geomechanics. There is not a single model that captures all of these aspects of the wormholing phenomenon which requires further development of more accurate 3D multiphase/multiphysics models. This challenge is the principal motive for this work. The objective of this paper is to model carbonate acidizing more accurately from a geochemical point of view. All previous numerical models consider only the acid/rock reaction and the transport of hydrogen ions only. In this work, we also account for chemical reactions between the aqueous species, including the dissolved CO2, under full-speciation transportation. This is done by solving the Reaction-Advection-Diffusion (RAD) equation not only for the Hydrogen ions, but also for all other primary species. Coupling of transport and reaction equations is done using a Sequential Non-Iterative Approach (SNIA). Aqueous kinetics are assumed at equilibrium, while rock/acid reaction is kinetically constrained. Single-phase 2D & 3D simulations of HCl injection in limestone rock are performed under a linear flow geometry. Results of the full speciation simulations are validated with previous experimental work, and compared with results from previous numerical models. This has been accomplished with special focus on the treatment design parameters; optimum injection rate, volume of acid injected to achieve breakthrough. The simulations show that; 1) the full-speciation model captures the different dissolution patterns reported experimentally, 2) confirms the existence of an optimum injection rate that corresponds to minimum volume of acid injected, 3) aqueous kinetics affect the treatment design parameters. We have performed a more geochemically accurate simulation of carbonate acidizing with HCl that takes in to account aqueous kinetics and effect of other species other than hydrogen ions. We believe that this is another step forward towards fully capturing the complex wormholing phenomenon.|","Reactive fluid flow, Carbonates, Matrix Acidizing, TOUGHREACT, Wormholing"

Estimation of stimulated rock volume (SRV) is the cornerstone offield development planning in shale reservoirs. The EUR has a first order dependency on the SRV and therefore its estimation is extremely critical for field development. 
In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate the SRV and hence the EUR for a shale reservoir using seismic data, flow and geomechanical simulation. The backbone of our methodology is seismic inversion coupled with geomechanical simulation. We apply our technique to data acquired from the Barnett shale. 
In this work, we first use 3D seismic and sonic logs to perform pre-stack seismic inversion. Then, we derive the distribution of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus in the area of interest (AOI). We constrain the porosity in our geo cellular model using a rock type model. Our rock type model for this work is based on k-means clustering on multi-well log analysis. 
We modeled a well in the AOI for which microseismic data is available. Weused a coupledflow and geomechanical simulator to mimic the fracturing process and the fluid volumes injected during the actual completion of the well. For geomechanical coupling, we used Barton-Bandis model in seismic inversion-derived Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio 3D volumes. Next, we compare our results with the SRV obtained by an analysis of microseismic data. We reconcile differences in the model-derived SRV and then calibrate the resulting flow model and use the history-matched model for forecasting production. 
Our results indicate an excellent match on SRV and therefore production data. Because we usevariable geomechanical parameters along the lateral, we observe irregular SRV's and drainage areas consistent with the microseismic data. Our methodology for predicting microseismic can be used for asset evaluation, acreage prioritization and to optimize the completion design in unconventional plays.|","Decline curves, Resource estimation, Seismic attribute"

Poststimulation operations on multistage hydraulically stimulated horizontal wells producing from conventional and unconventional reservoirs have a major impact on long-term well performance. Most common types of poststimulation services on such wells include plug drillout (PDO) operations and well flowback (WFB) operations. During these operations, the hydraulic fracture system experiences major changes in pressure and flowrate, which may affect the well's long-term productivity. Among the many mechanisms responsible for decrease in well productivity, we highlight 1) the risk of losing the connection between the wellbore and hydraulic fracture system because of the development of an unpropped area; 2) rock destabilization, and 3) the risk of scaling and precipitation. 
In this paper, we describe an integrated engineering and operations workflow for optimizing poststimulation operations on horizontal wells by controlling the productive fracture system evolution during the poststimulation period. The approach is based on applying the secure operating envelope (SOE) concept, which provides a set of operating parameters that ensure preservation of the connection between the hydraulic fractures and wellbore. The SOE is defined for each individual well, using a combination of geomechanical and multiphase transport modeling. It accounts for reservoir properties, well completion, and fracture treatment parameters. High-resolution, real-time monitoring of well performance and active control of bottomhole conditions through choke management ensure the well is operated within the SOE. The production objectives combined with the evolution of the SOE enable an overall strategy for poststimulation operations. 
The paper outlines how the SOE is constructed. Applications of the proposed approach on horizontal oil and gas wells in unconventional reservoirs in North America are reported, both during well flowback and plug drillout operations. Using the SOE during well flowback helps to predict and avoid a decrease in well production performance caused by excessive proppant flowback which results in creation of near-wellbore pinch points inside hydraulic fractures. Additionally, plug drillout was identified as a critical operation, during which the proppant pack can be destabilized. The associated risk was strongly reduced by applying the SOE concept in combination with high-resolution monitoring. 
Based on data obtained from more than 50 operated wells, we conclude that the proposed methodology, including application of geomechanical modeling to poststimulation operations, brings significant opportunities for optimization of well performance and securing long-term well productivity.|","Fracture damage, Well flowback, Plug Drillout, Optimization of Poststimulation Operations, Well productivity"

Lost circulation occurs when mud or cement is lost to the formation while drilling. Lost circulation has been a huge problem and may cause heavy financial costs in the form of lost rig time and mud fluid and in severe cases, well blowout with serious environmental and safety consequences. Despite extensive advances in the last couple of decades, lost circulation materials used today still have disadvantages such as damaging production zones, failing to seal the fractures or just sealing the fractures without strengthening the well. Here, we propose a new class of smart expandable lost circulation material (LCM) to remotely control the expanding force and functionality of injected LCM. Our smart LCM is made out of thermoset shape memory polymers and becomes activated by formation natural heat as well as electromagnetic waves if needed, hence it can effectively seal fractures’ width without damaging production zone and strengthen the wellbore. The activation temperature of the LCMs can be adjusted based on the formation temperature. We conducted a series of experiments using a HPHT particle-plugging apparatus (PPA) to measure the sealing efficiency of the smart LCMs as a proof of concept. Various slot disc sizes were used to mimic different size fractures in the formation. The API RP 13 B-1&2 have been followed as standard test methods to evaluate fluid loss in water based muds.|","Wellbore strengthening, LCM, Expandable LCM, Loss circulation materials, Shape memory polymers"

Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation technique used in unconventional reservoirs to generate sufficient reservoir contact for viable production. During stimulation, proppant is pumped into the system to keep fractures open when, at a later stage, injection ceases and fluid is recovered as fractures close. Thus, controlling proppant distribution in the fracture is important to improve well productivity. Several factors influence proppant placement and settling such as proppant size, proppant density and carrier-fluid rheology. However, accurately predicting, and consequently optimizing, proppant placement in complex fracture systems remains an industry challenge. The objective of this study is to use advanced modeling techniques of proppant transport inside complex fracture systems using a 3D simulator that couples geomechan ics, fracture mechanics, fluid behavior and proppant transport to assess the optimization of stimulation treatments. In this study proppant transport models incorporate the interaction between hydraulic fractures (HF) and natural fractures (NF) of various sizes and orientations. Treatments were simulated in systematic variations of proppant size, proppant density and fluid viscosity. Fluid rheology, proppant size and density are all major parameters affecting the proppant settling rate. In more complex systems, proppant placement is strongly influenced by the location, size, and orientation of natural fractures. Based on the size of proppant and viscosity of the injected fluid, proppant may or may not enter the natural fractures.|","Natural fracture, Proppant settling, Complex Hydraulic Fracture Propagation, 3D Numerical Modeling, Proppant transport"

During the downturn in the oil and gas industry, many operators have chosen to refracture their previously underperforming wells to boost economics with lower investment compared to drilling new wells. More than 100 horizontal wells have been refractured using chemical diverters across multiple basins in North America since the second half of 2013. Many papers have been published discussing these case studies. However, the refracturing results have been inconsistent. One of the biggest challenges of refracturing with chemical diverters is not knowing what is actually happening down hole. To better understand what is happening, more refracture modeling should be performed to more reliably predict production results before spending the upfront capital for a refracturing treatment. 
A proposed refracture numerical simulation methodology was employed to take into account the historical production depletion using calculated pressure and stress measurements along the lateral and in the reservoir. The altered stress fields resulting from reservoir depletion are calculated through a comprehensive workflow coupling simulated 3D reservoir pressure with a geomechanical finite-element model (FEM) described in a previous published paper. After the stress and pressure are updated, the new approach outlined in this paper is validated by production history matching real data from a previously refractured well in the Haynesville basin to provide more confidence in the end results. The main uncertainty in the process is how much of the lateral was stimulated. This paper also provides a sensitivity example to show how the model can be altered to predict different lateral coverage percentages. 
Refracture modeling still poses a major challenge for engineers because of the reservoir complexity and uncertainty downhole while refracturing (i.e. reservoir heterogeneity, isolation efficiency, etc.). However, this proposed refracturing approach provides a basic guideline on how to model refracturing treatments in a numerical simulator with the help of altered stress fields caused by reservoir depletion. This can be used to better understand why previously refractured wells perform the way they do and to better predict the performance of future refractured wells.|","Stimulation, Haynesville Shale, Refrac Strategy, Pad Refracturing"

Inc.| Blake, Kenyon J., Chevron Energy Technology Company| Fuller, Michael J., Chevron Energy Technology Company| Zaki, Karim, Chevron Energy Technology Company","|Abstract 
Long term productivity is impacted by both the magnitude and rate of skin growth during the life of the well. Many deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Operators experience premature Productivity Index (PI) decline, which significantly impairs the economics of many major capital projects (MCP). Stringent application of best practices in both design and execution phases of deepwater wells can alleviate premature skin growth during the well life. The current study summarizes some critical best practices that impact the rate of PI decline in a broad dataset of recent cased hole frac pack (CHFP) completions. 
This study outlines a methodology to assess the relative impact of numerous variables that affect the frac pack deliverability. Application of this methodology requires early project phase development of a 3D mechanical earth model optimizing the number and location of drill centers and associated well paths ensuring they are optimal for frac pack completions. The methodology includes the completion phase, and that the assessment of completion-execution performance is fed back into the planning of future wells. This feedback loop across deepwater projects identifies best practices in execution and continual improvement in future completions. 
Over 70 CHFP completions in six different deepwater fields are assessed and correlated to their productivity trends. Information from this broad dataset helps to develop new and confirm established best practices. These best practices are derived by cross-functional analysis of factors related to the reservoir, completion-design, execution and the effects on long term deliverability of these wells. Our analysis concluded that three specific factors showed the highest impact in achieving a successful CHFP with improved initial skins and anticipated lower rate of skin-increase with reservoir pressure decline. While many sub-factors contribute to their relative impact, these three key factors include: 1) fracture- wellbore connectivity; 2) sufficient fracture-width and conductivity in the near-wellbore region to withstand changing reservoir conditions; and 3) an undamaged and intact annular proppant pack. The details associated with improving the likelihood of achieving each of the key factors and other findings are explored in-depth in the current work. Consideration of these high-impact variables and other best practices is-assessed and quantified within the new workflow, providing feedback to improve future completions and MCP developments. 
Our data set provides the most comprehensive collective study of frac pack completions in the Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, the cross-functional expertise that contributed to the analyses of sub-variables brought the ""best minds to the table"". These attributes and the wide number of variables that were examined outline key best practices that should apply to any CHFP execution. The improved completions- workflow and comparison between producing CHFP completions allow prediction of future productivity trends.

The objective of this paper is to determine how the fluid shear viscosity and the elasticity would influence the particle settling velocity and even more so to answer the question of which one of these two rheological properties is more dominant in controlling the particle settling velocity when viscoelastic drilling fluids are used. 
The settling velocities of the spherical particles (diameters: 1.18, 1.5, 2 and 3mm) in partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymer fluids were measured by using Particle Image Shadowgraph (PIS) technique. Two sets of test fluids were formulated by mixing three different grades of HPAM (molecular weights of 500,000; 8,000,000; and 20,000,000) at polymer concentrations 0.09%, 0.05% and 0.03% wt. The shear viscosity and elasticity characteristics of test fluids were determined by performing shear viscosity and frequency sweep oscillatory measurements, respectively. The first set of fluids had almost identical shear viscosity characteristics while showing significantly different elastic properties (quantified in terms of relaxation time). The second set of fluids had similar elastic properties but different shear viscosity characteristics. In addition, the effect of the particle size on the settling velocities in these test fluids was also investigated. 
Experimental results showed that: (i) When the fluids having similar shear viscosity profile were used, the settling velocity of spherical particles decreased significantly with the increasing fluid elasticity. The experimentally measured settling velocities were also compared against the values calculated from Shah et al. (2007) model developed for predicting the settling velocity of spherical particles in power law (visco-inelastic) fluids. Results have shown that the settling velocity values can be 14 to 50 times over-estimated if the effect of the elasticity is not considered; (ii) At constant elasticity, the settling velocity of spherical particles also decreased significantly when the fluid shear viscosity was increased; (iii) The spherical particles settling velocity increased pronouncedly as their diameter increased from 1.18mm to 3mm. But the magnitude of the increase in settling velocity with the increasing particle diameter is less for the samples having higher elasticity and similar shear viscosity characteristics. The fluid shear viscosity and the elasticity both seem to have significant effect on the particle settling velocity. However, from the field operational point of view, fluids with high shear viscosity values are not always practical to use as the high shear viscosity increases the parasitic pressure losses and potentially has a negative effect on the drilling rate. Hence, in such cases increasing the fluid elasticity can help to reduce the particle settling velocity even at lower shear viscosity values. 
By conducting experiments under controlled conditions, for the first time in drilling literature, we were able to quantify the individual effects of fluid shear viscosity and elasticity on the particle settling velocity.|","Drilling Fluids, Viscoelasticity, Settling velocity, Particle Image Shadowgraph"

The Montney Formation which stretches from Alberta to British Columbia is one of the largest unconventional gas resources in North America. Production from the Montney Formation comes primarily from the Upper Montney and Lower Montney Formations which vary both from reservoir quality and geomechanical perspectives. Historically, completion and stimulation optimization fell into two distinct categories (1) field observation supported by reservoir and fracture simulation or (2) statistical analysis. Few, if any, statistical studies on optimizing unconventional completions and fracture stimulation combined information from the statistical analysis with that of the simulation. This paper does just that for the Montney Formation by comparing and contrasting the Upper and the Lower Montney completions and fracture stimulation statistical results with a reservoir and fracture simulation study to better understand key drivers for successful stimulation of multiple fractured horizontal wells. 
Previous work (Mohammed et al. 2016) documented the statistical analysis of 296 cased-hole horizontal gas wells' completions in the Upper and the Lower Montney Formation. The study showed the effect of cased-hole completion and stimulation parameters on gas production performance in both the Upper and the Lower Montney Formations. In this paper, previous statistical results were extended by adding hydraulic fracture modeling using 3D finite element simulator. The results from the statistical analysis and hydraulic fracture modeling were compared on a set of parameters such as the effect of the number of clusters per stage (1-to-5), changes in proppant mass (50% decrease or increase) and treatment volumes. The results also show the effect of cluster spacing and proppant type on fracture dimensions and production performance within the Upper and the Lower Montney Formation.

It has been shown in controlled laboratory experiments and some field studies that the onset of sand production in gas wells differs from that in oil wells. Results from a general 3-D sand production model are presented to explain the differences in the onset of sanding and sand production volume for different fluids and under different flow and in-situ stress conditions. The sand production model accounts for multi-phase fluid flow and is fully coupled with an elasto-plastic geomechanical model. Sanding criteria considers both mechanical failure and sand erosion by fluid flow. Non-Darcy flow is implemented to account for the high flow rates. The drag forces on the sand grains are computed based on the in-situ Reynolds number. Both the intact rock strength and the residual rock strength depend on water saturation. Water evaporation (drying) due to gas flow is modeled using phase equilibrium calculations. 
The onset of sand production is compared for different fluid types (oil and gas). Model results are shown to be consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature. For example, the onset of sanding is observed at higher compressive stresses for gas wells as compared to oil wells. Theprimary mechanism for this is for the first time shown to be sand strengthening induced by evaporation of water. This effect is not observed in oil wells. The sand production rate when non-Darcy effectsareconsidered is lower than for Darcy flow. The reason for this is the lower fluid velocity (for the same drawdown) and consequently smaller drag forces on the failed sand grains. The effect of water breakthrough and water cut on sand production is studied from both mechanical and erosional perspectives. The model is shown to be capable of accurately predicting the onset of sanding and sand production induced by multi-phase and compressible fluid flows, helping us to predict sanding issues in both oil and gas wells.|","gas wells, multi-phase, water breakthrough, sand production, sand strengthening"

The challenge of drilling through depleted zones, particularly in mature areas, continues to increase in importance as they are a frequent and familiar scenario for many fields. Pressure overbalances have been reported as high as 13,000 psi, although they more typically range in the hundreds to thousands psi. Wellbore stability problems associated with these zones can be linked to both drilling-induced and pre-existing fractures resulting in subsequent fluid losses. It is generally acknowledged that the solution to these problems is a combination of drilling fluid optimization and good drilling practices. Currently, the fluid solution is to incorporate large particulates in the form of a pill to seal such fractures, which consequently increases the drilling window. While the advantages of using a pill are known, large particulates also carry disadvantages, for example the retroactive nature of acting as a remedy rather than a prevention for lost circulation as well as leading to non-productive. 
Formulations with various synergistic additives were examined through standard tests, including rheological profiles, high-pressure/ high-temperature fluid loss, and permeability plugging, some of which were performed on various porous disk media, including sandstone formation samples. Unique equipment was also developed and used to simulate a growing fracture mouth, or aperture, along with a proprietary mathematical model for the mechanism and geometry of fracture growth. The laboratory data supported a clear fracture mechanism and subsequent sealing, which was ultimately proven by yard test to confirm the laboratory and model predictions of performance. 
Compared to commonly used particle packing/stress caging, the novel technology developed and testing performed demonstrates a new approach. The solution employs a continuous self-healing filtercake, rather than a large-sized lost circulation material pill application, to increase the drilling window and decrease risks of formation damage. The authors will present selected laboratory test methods and results, including a large scale fracture test and the associated mathematical modeling. This work shows a potential improvement in the drilling window while meeting environmental regulatory requirements in the Gulf of Mexico.|","Continuously, Zones, Depleted, Wellbore, Strengthening"

The conductivity and density of fractures intersecting a borehole strongly influence well productivity, making fracture characterization an important aspect of reservoir management. A Stoneley-wave inversion process is presented to estimate borehole washout volume and fracture conductivity. In addition to identifying conductive fractures, the ability to detect borehole washout volume can impact other well operations, such as cementing or geomechanical property estimation, in situations where placing a caliper tool in the borehole is not desirable. 
Low-frequency Stoneley wave reflections are commonly used to locate and evaluate fractures crossing a fluid-filled, open borehole. However, other mechanisms, such as the reflection from bed boundaries or changes in borehole size, can also induce secondary pressure waves. The inversion of reflectivity over a frequency bandwidth can be used to determine whether a secondary wave is likely the result of a conductive fracture, borehole washout, or the combination of both a washout and a fracture. The integration of additional information from other logs, such as borehole images, caliper, slowness, etc., is used to further distinguish fractures from bedding effects. 
This paper describes the theoretical considerations and signal-processing techniques used in this integrated approach, and results from the analysis of field data are presented. The inversion bandwidth ranges from a minimum frequency of 300 to 500 Hz to a maximum of several kHz and is automatically adjusted based on data quality. Several wells were studied using forward modeling and numeric inversion. A comparison of inversion results to borehole images and caliper logs shows depth registration errors typically of 0.3 m (1 ft) or less. The inversion of all reflectivity measurements over the specified bandwidth distinguishes borehole washouts (stronger high-frequency response) from conductive fractures (stronger low-frequency response) and thus provides a more reasonable estimate of fracture conductivity compared to conventional wide-band integrated-amplitude reflection analyses.|","fracture conductivity, Stoneley reflection, washout volume, fracture analysis, inversion"

Previous experimental observations have shown the formation of distinct failure patterns and cavity shapes under different stress and flow conditions. With isotropic stress, spiral failure patterns with localized shear bands are likely to form. On the other hand, under anisotropic stress, V-shape cavities, dog-ear cavities or slit mode cavities are usually observed. However, the mechanisms for the development of these sanding cavities remain unclear. In addition, in order to accurately predict the onset of sanding and predict the sand production rate, it is crucial to capture the physics of formation of these cavities during sand production. 
This paper presents a fully coupled poro-elasto-plastic, 3-D sand production model for sand production prediction around open-hole and perforated wellbores in a weakly consolidated formation. Sanding criteria are based on a combination of shear failure, tensile failure and compressive failure from Mohr-Coulomb theory and strain-hardening/softening. Once the failure criteria are met, an algorithm for entrainment of the sand based on the calculation of hydrodynamic forces is implemented to predict sand erosion and transport. Dynamic mesh refinement has been implemented to effectively capture the strain localization regions. 
The model has been validated with multiple analytical solutions. In addition, it is applied to compare with previous sand production experiments that have explored the different cavity shapes formed under different conditions. The model is capable of not only explaining the mechanisms responsible for each type of cavity shape but also predicting what cavity shape will be formed under a specific set of conditions. Parametric studies for these cases provide additional insight into the important role that the post-yield, poro-elasto-plastic properties of the sand play in controlling the sanding mechanisms and cavity development. This allows us to much more accurately predict the onset of sanding and the sanding rate.|","cavity shape, sanding mechanisms, sand production, 3D poro-elasto-plasticity, sand erosion"

Fluids introduced into a reservoir for stimulation typically take the path of least resistance and therefore frequently go into areas where there are open flow paths. In many cases, those are neither the areas you would want to stimulate for increased production nor areas from which formation damage will need to be removed. The success of a hydraulic fracturing or an acidizing operation depends on maximizing the contact between the fracturing fluid (or acid) and intact rocks. To achieve this goal, existing fluid paths must be effectivelyplugged to divert the fluid towards intact rock for an efficient application. 
A typical fluid diversion application can be divided into three major steps; i.e., displacement from surface to downhole, downhole plugging/diversion and corresponding stimulation and production efficiency.The aim of this paper is to review and identify the criticalparameters controlling the downhole plugging and diversion step. In addition, an analytical solution is used for predicting minimum required concentration of solid-particulate diverting agent. The proposed model incorporates multiple operational parameters such as flow rate, fluid viscosity, particle size, and opening size. The validity of the proposed solution is checked byusing experimental testswith single slot-opening. In addition, a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) model has also been used to verify the proposed analytical solution.The findings will have beneficial implications for acidizing, multistage hydraulic fracturing, and refracturing operations. 
By using a scientific approach, better understanding of the controlling parameters along with the verified analytical solution,we can better design and achieve efficient fluid diversion and necessary pressure buildup.The analytical solution verified against both experimental data and advanced numerical simulations (CFD-DEM) can significantly and reliably enhance the diversion job efficiency. Using the analytical solution along with the thorough understanding of underlying mechanisms, we can optimize the particulate system characteristics for a successful diversion process. As an example and by selecting the minimum required concentration, we can eliminate the excessive use of diverting agents, which would reduce costs and adverse effects on equipment resulting from high concentrations.|","Solid Particulate, Diversion, Engineered Design, Fracturing"

This paper presents a tailored coated proppant that provides improved solutions for various hydraulic fracturing challenges. The coating aims to enhance proppant transport with slickwater fluids while improving the hydrocarbon mobility into the proppant pack and reducing respirable crystalline silica during the operations. The paper discusses results from over 30 field trials in multiple low permeability formations. 
The novel multifaceted coating was designed to modify the wettability of proppants’ surfaces to increase the surface's affinity for gases and reduce the generation of respirable airborne particles. By adding small volumes of gases into the proppant-laden slurry, gas bubbles get attached to the surface of the proppant leading to significant reduction in its apparent specific gravity. In order to prove the operational and economic advantages of the multifunctional proppant, a series of novel laboratory experiments were conducted under various operational conditions, followed by numerous field trials in several low permeability formations. 
The laboratory tests showed that the coated proppant can stay suspended in the presence of gases for extended period of time. The laboratory evaluation involved testing under pressures and temperatures up to 12,500 psi and 400°F with different fluid systems made from both fresh and high-salinity waters. Oil mobility tests showed that the oil flow rate was increased by 74% compared to uncoated sand. Several multistage fracturing treatments executed with significantly higher proppant concentrations up to 6.1 lbs/gal in typical slickwater treatments when used with 1.5 – 10 % foam quality. Onsite measurements have proven that the coating reduced the generation of respirable airborne particles down to 10 – 30 <U+03BC>g/m3 throughout the proppant lifecycle. Data obtained from numerous field trials showed that the novel proppant technology resulted in improved well productivity, increased oil cuts and reduced water production.|","Dust Control, Self-Suspending Proppant, Multifunctional Proppant, Slickwater Fracturing with High Proppant Loading"

Many studies attributed wellbore instability problems to physical and chemical interactions between rocks and drilling fluids; however the impact of drillstring vibration was neglected. This study aims to investigate the effect of drillstring vibration on wellbore stability; and determine major factors lead to drillstring collision with wellbore. 
Drillstring vibration mechanisms are reviewed and correlated with wellbore instability field case to identify type of drillstring vibration responsible for wellbore failure. Then, drillstring equations of motion are solved utilizing Runga-Kutta numerical scheme; and sensitivity analysis is done to assess the effect of each variable (inputs) on drillstring radial displacement. Moreover, new model is developed to predict critical ranges of drillstring vibration that collapse wellbore. Model bases on rock mechanics principles, whirl vibration mechanism and Newton second law. 
Results show a direct relation between whirl vibration initiation and wellbore instability; however axial and torsional vibrations have negligible effect. Wellbore failures resulted from drillstring vibration are more likely to happen in small hole sizes (6 in) than bigger holes. Drill collar length and drillstring revolutions per minutes are the primary factors aggravate drillstring collision with wellbore, while wellbore inclination and mud weight have minor impact. When drillstring vibrates and hits wellbore wall, hole collapse happens due rock compressive failure, rock fatigue, and reduction in rock strength. The innovated model estimates values of drillstring accelerations that collapse wellbore, and predicts optimum mud weight needed for safe drilling before and after reduction in rock strength due to drillstring vibration. 
Research findings reduce risks of wellbore collapse and drillstring failure resulted from drillstring vibration by: presenting recommendations in drillstring design and drilling optimization; and utilizing model outputs to compute critical limits of drillstring vibration and optimum mud weight to prevent drillstring collision with wellbore.|",""

In recent years, there has been a proliferation of massive subsurface data from instrumented wells. This places significant challenges on traditional production data analysis methods for extracting useful information, in support of reservoir management and decision-making. Additionally, with increased exploration interest in unconventional shale gas reservoirs, there is a heightened need for improved techniques and technologies to enhance understanding of induced and natural fracture characteristics in the subsurface, as well as their associated impacts on fluid flow and transport. 
The above challenges have the potential to be addressed by developing Big Data analytic tools that focus on uncovering masked trends related to fracture properties from large volumes of subsurface data, through the application of pattern recognition techniques. We present a new framework for fast and robust production data classification, which is adapted from a real-time face detection algorithm. This is achieved by generalizing production data as vectorized 1-D images with pixel values indicating rate magnitudes. Using simulated shale gas production data, we train a boosted binary classification algorithm which is capable of providing probabilistic predictions. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for identifying hydraulically fractured wells which have the potential to benefit from restimulation treatment. The results show significant improvements over existing type-curve based approaches for recognizing favorable candidate wells, using solely gas rate profiles.|","hydraulic fracturing, big data, restimulation, shale gas, production data analysis"

We present a unified numerical simulator for reservoir engineering problems of the highest complexity: fully compositional and black-oil, three-phase, compressible flow on three-dimensional unstructured grid. 
In the context of black-oil modeling, where hydrocarbon components are lumped into a gas and an oil component with only the gas component being allowed to transfer between oil and gas phases, study cases may involve treating a variable bubble point pressure throughout the reservoir (e.g., in water flooding into saturated reservoirs, or introducing gas into an undersaturated grid cell). Traditionally, a primary variable switching strategy for phase appearance or disappearance has been proposed, which inherits convergence and phase identification issues. In this study, we adopt an overall molar composition-based framework that can self-consistently take care of such complications. We compute the black-oil properties from tables initially constructed through fully compositional phase split calculations. Phase properties across a broad range of pressures for different black-oil compositions are interpolated to correctly model the transitions between saturated and undersaturated states. While maintaining the accuracy, we are able to gain considerable speed-up in black-oil model -more pronounced in saturated reservoirs- as compared to the fully compositional model. 
In addition, previous black-oil models are mostly limited to low order numerical schemes. Here finite element (FE) methods are adopted, which are well suited to parallelization and provide flexibility in discretizing the geometry. Mass transport is updated explicitly by a locally mass conserving discontinuous Galerkin method. Globally continuous pressure and velocity fields are obtained through an implicit mixed hybrid FE scheme. The robustness and accuracy of our FE simulator are demonstrated in several complex problems, where we have attained considerable speed-up and maintained the accuracy by means of the new black-oil model, specifically for phase split computations.|",""

Shale permeability is commonly measured by the unsteady state methods, such as pulse-decay or GRI methods, because the shale has a permeability in nano-Darcy range. The permeability values by determined by these techniques have been found often to have large margin of uncertainty as a result of inconsistent experimental protocols and the complex interpretations methods. |In this study, petrophysical properties of the Marcellus shale core plugs were measured using an innovative laboratory setup, referred to as Precision Petrophysical Analysis Laboratory (PPAL). PPAL is designed to accurately measure the petrophysical properties of ultra-low permeability core plugs under the reservoir conditions. PPAL measurements are performed under steady-state isothermal conditions flow conditions and the analysis of the results do not require complicated interpretations. The key advantage of the PPAL is the capability to measure the permeability and porosity of the shale core plugs under a wide range of confining and pore pressures. In addition, the impact of gas adsorption (or desorption) on the measurements can be monitored. The core plugs used in this study were made available through the Marcellus Shale Energy and Environment Laboratory (MSEEL), a dedicated field laboratory in the Marcellus Shale. MSEEL has been established to undertake field and laboratory research to advance and demonstrate new subsurface technologies and to enable surface environmental studies related to unconventional energy development. The filed site is owned and operated by Northeast Natural Energy, LLC and contains several horizontal Marcellus Shale wells. In addition, a vertical well has been drilled specifically for obtaining core, log, and other data for scientific purposes (science well). |The results of the core plug permeability measurements indicated that that the permeability values decline as the gas (pore) pressure increases. Reliable values of the absolute permeability can be obtained by the application of the double-slippage correction for all pore pressure ranges but more specifically for pore pressures below 900 psia. Klinkenberg correction on the other hand, can only provide reliable values for the absolute permeability when the pore pressures are above 900 psia. The determined absolute permeability values were found to be impacted by the net stress. The analysis stress data with the aid of Walsh plot provided the estimates of the fracture (fissure) closure pressure.

Previous studies focused on investigating the proppant transport in smooth vertical fractures, which did not consider the effect of the fracture-surface roughness. We examine the migration of proppants in rough and vertical fractures and then quantitatively reveal the effect of roughness on the instantaneous proppant transport and final proppant placement. Two types of rock samples (marble and granite) are fractured with the Brazilian test and molded to manufacture 20 <U+00D7> 20 <U+00D7> 5 cm transparent replicas. The surface roughness of these rock samples was first characterized by fractal dimensions. Then, the dyed fracturing fluid with a given proppant loading was injected into the rough vertical fracture. In each test, the inlet pressures were continuously monitored in order to obtain the differential pressure across the fracture model while the proppants were being transported in the fracture. The process was videotaped to real-time track the proppant distribution in the rough fracture. |The proppant-transport behavior in the rough and vertical fracture was observed to be totally different from that in the smooth fracture. The major experimental findings include the following: 1) The proppant in a rough vertical fracture does not progress as a regular sand bank that commonly occurs in the smooth fracture, but rather an irregular-shape sand clusters with fractal characteristics; 2) In the rough and vertical fracture, the phenomenon of proppant bridging is visually observed, and such phenomenon is more likely to occur in the location with a larger roughness height. This implies rough fracture could promote a wider spreading of the proppant in the fracture compared to smooth fractures, and; 3) The existence of roughness enhances the vertical displacement of fluid containing proppants. These effects are also favorable for obtaining a better filling of the proppants in the fracture. Our experimental study reveals the mechanisms of proppant transport and distribution in real vertical fractures under the influence of roughness effect.|","Fracture roughness, Proppant settling, Fracture conductivity, Two-phase flow"

Completion strategy, Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) properties and petrophysical properties vary from play to play. Hence, the well operating practices should be custom tailored to suit the completion and fluid properties. |In this paper, we propose optimal shut-in practices for dry gas shale reservoirs. We elaborated our study from a Marcellus shale dataset. Marcellus shale dry gas window has in place fluid properties that differ from liquid rich reservoirs like Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp shales. Therefore, production best practices borrowed ""as-is"" from liquid rich reservoirs and applied to dry gas reservoirs (or vice versa) may not affect the well ultimate recoveries in a positive manner and in some cases, may even reduce the expected ultimate recoveries (EUR's). |We show that the practice of ""well conditioning"", ""resting"" or ""soak-in"" i.e. shutting in the well for a significant time after hydraulic fracturing and before connecting to pipeline as well as frequent shut-in impedes the water unloading from the dry gas reservoirs.

We observe that after shut-in, water to gas ratio (WGR) decreases and gas rate increases. However, this increased gas rate is accompanied with higher declines in rates and pressures and ultimately leads to lower EUR's. The reduction in EUR in our case is modeled as a function of water saturation increase in the matrix due to imbibition.

Since the propagation of a hydraulic fracture is often asymmetric and depends on geomechanical factors, the ensuing pressure depletion and the EUR depends on this asymmetric behavior. An analytical asymmetric tri-linear model to approximate pressure depletion is presented. The model uses asymmetric frac design results as input and estimates the pressure depletion around a parent well. This new approach represents an acceptable alternative to full reservoir simulation when investigating frac hits problems. |This asymmetric tri-linear model was combined with our poro-elastic geomechanical modeling simulator in order to capture the physics created by the depleted pressure sink zone.

Some of the microseismic events are reactivations of NFs induced by a direct hit of HF, while others are induced by the fluid leak-off from the previous stages or by elastic waves emitted into the reservoir with hydraulic fracture plane propagation. The former NFs have a chance to be propped there as the latter will not significantly increase their contribution to the production. Identification of such microseismic events helps to reduce uncertainty in the description of fracture network geometry. |Based on inferred data from core analysis NF densities and orientations, we generated multiple realizations of the semi-stochastic Discrete Fracture Network (DFN). In order to constrain them, we used time evolution of microseismic cloud in addition to results of core analysis. Fluid and proppant pumping schedule is used to identify such microseismic events because they should be located close to the pressure diffusion front generated by hydraulic fluid. Events outside of proposed region may be triggered by other factors, such as stress-strain relaxation from other stages and correspondent fractures. In most cases, they are not wide enough to take proppant from the main HF. This approach was used to reduce range of production for DFN realizations. |This workflow is implanted to a 15-stage hydraulic fracture treatment on a horizontal well placed in a siltstone reservoir with intrinsic fractures. The spatio-temporal dynamics of microseismic events are classified into two groups by the front of nonlinear pressure diffusion caused by 3-dimensional hydraulic fracturing, considered as effective and ineffective events. DFNs with only effective microseismicity and with all the induced events are generated. Then, two types of DFN related uncertainties on production are performed to evaluate the impact of filtration. Results of aleatory uncertainty quantification caused by the randomness of DFN modeling indicate the filtered events can generate a production DFN with a more consistent connected fracture area. Moreover, sensitivity analysis caused by lack of accuracy in natural fracture characterization shows the production area of DFN with filtration process is more insensitive to the variation of fracture parameters. Finally, a history match with production data and pressure data indicates this DFN model properly represents the reservoir and completion. |Our methodology characterizes well the conductive fracture network utilizing core data, microseismic data, and pumping schedule.

An advanced wellbore-scale three dimensional numerical studies with a coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element model (DEM) were performed to simulate different mechanisms involved in particulate diversion. The results of wellbore-scale simulation were translated into an engineering particulate diversion model, based on the proven diversion mechanisms from laboratory and simulation. The model is incorporated into an integrated carbonate acidizing simulator. |Generally particulate diversion is not used in carbonate acidizing because of the formation of the wormholes and potential difficulty in removing particles from the induced wormholes or perforation tunnel. The new degradable particulate system addresses the issue and presents an efficient approach to divert acid in carbonate stimulation. Detailed physics based simulation demonstrate that the induced wormholes or perforation would plug thru two distinct mechanisms: (1) temporarily seal the entrance of small scale wormholes or perforation with a combination of small and large particles, and/or (2) large particles bridge along tapered path of wormhole/perforation and forms a temporary filter cake on the mouth of opening.

Besides the geometry of the fracture, the injection rate should be optimal for obtaining desired results such as maintaining sufficient aperture for proppant placement, avoiding screenouts or proppant bridging, and also preventing caprock-integrity failure as a result of an extensively uncontrolled fracture in reservoirs. A sophisticated numerical model derived from the cohesive-elements method has been developed and validated using field data to obtain an insight on the optimal fracture geometry and injection rate that can lead to a safe and efficient operation. The HF operation has been conducted in an oil field in the Persian Gulf with the aim of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) from a limestone reservoir with low matrix permeability in a horizontal wellbore. The concept of the cohesive-elements method with pore pressure as an additional degree of freedom has been applied to a 3D fully coupled HF model to estimate fracture geometry, specifically fracture height as a function of the optimal injection rate in a reservoir porous medium. It was observed that by increasing injection rate, all the fracture-geometry parameters steeply increased, but the fracture height must be controlled to be in the reservoir domain and not surpass the caprock and sublayer. For the reservoir under study with the maximum height of 100 m, length of 250 m, width of 100 m, permeability of 2 md, and porosity of 10%, the optimal fracture height is 73.4 m; the average fracture width and half-length are 12.8mm and 55.4 m, respectively. Therefore, the optimal injection rate derived from the fracture height and geometry is in this case 4.5 bbl/min. The computed fracture pressure (49.55 MPa = 7,283.85 psi) has been compared with the field fracture pressure (51.02 MPa = 7,500 psi), and the error obtained for these two values is 2.88%, which showed a very good agreement.|","Cohesive elements, Hydraulic fracturing, Fracture geometry, Cap rock integrity, Injection rate"

Conversely, permeability and porosity are observed to increase when net stress decreases; however, they typically follow a different path; this discrepancy is known as hysteresis. The trend of permeability and porosity hysteresis is a signature of porous media that depends on several chemical, physical, and mechanical properties. Understanding permeability and porosity hysteresis plays a significant role in production strategies of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The hysteresis effect on production strategies can be even more important in very-low-permeability reservoirs such as tight sandstone, tight carbonate, and shale/mudstone formations. The reason is that the stress change associated with permeability and porosity hysteresis can affect adsorption/desorption and diffusion-transport mechanisms that are among the main driving mechanisms in low- or ultralow-permeability reservoirs. |In this study, matrix permeability and porosity hysteresis of nano-, micro-, and millidarcy core samples are measured for a wide range of net stresses (500 to 4,500 psia).

Cryo-BIB-SEM in combination with high-resolution energy-dispersive-spectroscopy (EDS) imaging and automated image analysis on the saturated samples allowed for a quantification of the oil-droplet size, the lengths of carbonate/oil interfaces, and the 2D contact angle of carbonate with brine and oil. Our results show that these features (e.g., interface length, contact angles, effect of asperities) are present on the scale of a few tens of nanometers to a few micrometers, which is in agreement with numerous theoretical and experimental studies. Lixhe limestone showed relatively less carbonate/oil contacts despite a larger oil fraction in the MgSO4-brine-flooded sample compared with the sample flooded with NaCl brine, indicating a more-hydrophilic nature of the carbonate surface in this experiment. This feasibility study showed that the technique permits the testing of predictions on the morphology and dynamics of contact lines in relation to the mineral properties, which is not possible with other imaging methods, such as X-ray microcomputed tomography (µ-CT), because of limits in resolution.|","Pore connectivity, Capillary contact angle, Two phase fluid, Carbonate, EOR"

The first wells drilled in the field and its adjacent blocks experienced significant challenges, such as severe mud losses, stuck tools, losses in the hole, high treating pressure, and unexpected screenout. Because an accurate understanding of geomechanics and its roles at various scales is vital, 3D full-field and pad geomechanics models were developed for achieving efficiency and effectiveness in implementing the ODP. |Introduction |The Ordovician-Silurian Wufeng-Longmaxi hot shale is an emerging shale gas play in China. |Currently, the major exploration and development activities of the play are in the Sichuan Basin and its adjacent areas. For shale gas development in the Sichuan Basin and its adjacent areas, using the megascale, high-density, and continuous and regular pad drilling as is used in North America is difficult because surface and subsurface conditions are significantly different from those of the well-known North American shale plays. |The strong environmental and social constraints that typify the Sichuan Basin and surrounding area are shown in Fig. 1. Drilling pads for shale gas developments are commonly located in narrow valleys that are often home to farmland and residential villages with dense populations. Differences of elevation among neighboring pads can be from several hundred meters to more than 1000 m. To speed up development of marine shale gas in the Sichuan Basin and its adjacent areas with a minimized learning curve, a geoscience-to-production integration of research, engineering, and operation with its associated research and development, methodologies, and work flows must be applied. This geoscience-to-production integration aims to optimize both efficiency and effectiveness dynamically at single-well, pad, and field scales with systematic and continuous optimization of technologies and solutions and the accumulation of knowledge and experience to enhance well productivity. |One shale gas field, which is the study area of this paper, is in the mountainous area at the southern edge of the Sichuan Basin. The first wells drilled in this field and its adjacent blocks experienced significant geomechanics-associated challenges, such as severe mud losses, tools or drillingpipe sticking, losses in the hole, high treating pressure while hydraulic fracturing, and unexpected screen out of fracturing stages. Having reliable yet evolving understanding of geomechanics and its role at various scales during the progress of the ODP is vital. This paper describes the development of 3D full-field geomechanics models and high-resolution 3D pad geo-mechanics models and their engineering applications.|","Document Type

The addition of lost-circulation material (LCM) into drill-in fluid is the most popular technique for loss control. However, traditional LCM selection is mainly performed by use of the trial-and-error method because of the lack of mathematical models. The present work aims at filling this gap by developing a new mathematical model to characterize the performance of drill-in fluid-loss control by use of LCM during the drill-in process of fractured tight reservoirs. Plugging-zone strength and fracture-propagation pressure are the two main factors affecting drill-in fluid-loss control. The developed mathematical model consists of two submodels: the plugging-zone-strength model and the fracture-propagation-pressure model. Explicit formulae are obtained for LCM selection dependent on the proposed model to control drill-in fluid loss and prevent formation damage. Effects of LCM mechanical and geometrical properties on loss-control performance are analyzed for optimal fracture plugging and propagation control. Laboratory tests on loss-control effect by use of different types and concentrations of LCMs are performed. Different combinations of acid-soluble rigid particles, fibers, and elastic particles are tested to generate a synergy effect for drill-in fluid-loss control. The derived model is validated by laboratory data and successfully applied to the field case study in Sichuan Basin, China.|","lost circulation material, drill-in fluid loss, naturally fractured reservoir, formation damage prevention"

It has been produced with vertical wells that were either waterflooded or CO2 injected for primary, secondary, and tertiary recovery. Some of the early waterfloods date back to the 1960s. Historically, the San Andres formation is associated with high water cuts. This paper proposes an integrated solution from planning to completion of a horizontal well, with an aim to control water production. The workflow involves the integration of various technologies such as crosswell seismic, petrophysical logs, geomechanical logs, fracture modeling, and real-time microseismic monitoring. |Stratigraphic surfaces were created using the crosswell seismic data tied in with well tops from offset vertical wells. The 3D model was populated with high-tier petrophysical and geomechanical properties from the pilot well. The zones with high water saturations were identified in the subsurface, which gave an insight into the source of the produced water. Fully 3D planar fracture modeling was performed using the log data from the vertical offset well at the landing point of the horizontal well. Sensitivities were performed on various fluid systems, job volumes, and pump rates, and a playbook was created for real-time operations as part of a contingency plan. |Lateral measurements included petrophysical and geomechanical data, which were used to place perforations, within a stage, in similar type of rock. Depending on the real-time microseismic events, the stimulation design was changed on the fly. Stages with events that were growing out of the zone were modified first, and a final pump schedule was established after the first five stages. |The production results indicated a 20% decrease in water cut, which is a notable improvement compared to the historical production data in the San Andres. The workflow proved that the water production can be significantly reduced by applying a methodology that includes integration of data from multiple domains, thereby improving the economics of a well.|","fracture modeling, microseismic, horizontal, San Andres, Water production"

Understanding spatial and temporal in situ stress changes surrounding drilled uncompleted (DUC) wells or infill wells has become increasingly important as the industry works through its inventory of DUC wells and redesigns infill wells with an engineering approach. |Optimizing infill/DUC well completion designs requires an estimation of the altered in situ stress state. This study presents the concept of a ""production shadow"" as the stress change in four-dimensional space, affecting well performance and optimal well configurations for pad development. The production shadow accounts for the compound effects from both hydraulic fracture mechanical opening and stress-state alteration from depletion. |This paper details an Eagle Ford case study integrating production shadow effects into the parent and infill well hydraulic fracture modeling as well as ""frac hit"" analysis.

As with most unconventional resources, a lack of validation of reservoir parameters prevailed in the early history of these plays (emerging plays) and thus, hypothesis drove drilling and completion optimization programs. The 2015 drop in commodity prices accelerated the need to optimize well designs and spacing and stacking patterns in a less capital-intensive manner. A sector model was built that enabled discrete modeling of the 4 development wells in place and significant remaining undeveloped potential to be completed both within and near the sector model area. From this model, substantial understanding around the key parameters driving subsurface performance both from the rock and wellbore design perspectives was gained. As in-fill drilling has occurred in other areas of the play, a learning curve developed around the understanding of vertical connectivity, fracture geometry, well interference and the impact of clusters and job size on fracture contact with the reservoir. This learning curve has been applied to the integrated model to understand what an optimized infill drilling program for the area would look like at various hydrocarbon pricing scenarios. |This paper utilizes an integrated model approach to understand reservoir performance on a pad with four wells completed across multiple horizons in the Eagle Ford. Wireline quad combo compressional and shear log suites (including azimuthal anisotropy and VTI sonic processing, resitivity/acoustic borehole imagers, and NMR), core (geomechanical, geochemical analysis, routine core analysis and specialized core analysis), completion data (fracture treatments with pre-and post-job shut-in pressures), production data (1200 days of production history with a bottom-hole pressure gauge and calculated bottom hole pressures from rod pumps) are used to build petrophysical models, geo-models, geomechanical models, fracture propagation models and reservoir models with the aim of understanding completion and production drivers. A workflow is presented that enables these models to improve our understanding of layering effects (vertical connectivity), fracture asymmetry (pressure sinks or sources), well interference (hydraulic vs. propped lengths) and the impact of clusters and job size on fracture contact with the reservoir.|","history matching, geomechanics, ash bed laminations, in-fill development, fracture asymmetry"

Operators are targeting up to four different reservoirs in one section, using a wine-rack pattern, which is the future of pad drilling. The workflows discussed in this paper will help us in understanding the growth of the hydraulic fractures and their production interference with the offset wells. These integrated workflows are centered on building a calibrated 3D model, to perform predictive modeling on various combinations of stacked laterals and determine the optimum spacing, both vertically and laterally. |Technology integration plays a significant role in identifying the key drivers of production. Our workflows involve building a geomodel using high tier pilot well logs and utilizing an unconventional fracture model (UFM) to simulate hydraulic fractures to understand the overall fracture footprint. The fractures are then gridded in an unstructured manner and fed to a numerical reservoir simulator to perform production history matching. This is the most crucial step in the process because this calibrated model is then usedfor predictive modeling of the various combinations of lateral spacing and stacking. |Pilot well logs show varying degrees of high stress barriers that exist across the basin, and knowing the stress regime local to a field or section is important in determining the optimum landing locations and completion designs. Typical pump schedules for the zones of interest were selected based on current industry practices. Fully 3D planar fracture simulations performed on the pilot well resulted in 18 potential landing locations spanning the Upper Spraberry to the Lower Cline, based on fracture heights and theinterference between the zones. Out of the 18 targets, fivewere selected based on production potential. UFM simulations along the lateral show different fracture geometries in different reservoirs due to varying rock properties and natural fracture orientations. The production history matching was performed using a P50 type curve generated using public data for eachreservoir in the county, and using known reservoir fluid properties. |The modeling approach discussed in this paper can be applied to any data set within the basin to determine the optimum landing location, which could vary depending on changing reservoir properties.

S., Apache Corp| Nelson, B., Apache Corp","|Currently, real-time adjustments to drilling parameters such as weight on bit (WOB), drillstring revolutions per minute (RPM), flow rate, etc., are based primarily on experience. This is mainly due to the uncertain nature of information (both downhole and surface) available and inability of humans to aggregate multiple data streams in real-time to make optimal decisions. The objective therefore is to build a decision support tool that can overcome these limitations by automatically aggregating this data, identifying drilling inefficiency and suggesting optimal drilling parameters. |The methodology presented in this paper uses a Bayesian network to represent the drilling process and is capable of representing uncertainty in a way that is robust to bad sensor data. The model is updated in real-time and tracks variations in drilling conditions. Various dysfunctions such as bit balling, bit bounce, whirl, torsional vibrations, high mechanical specific energy (MSE), auto-driller erratic behavior, etc., are identified by tracking the movement characteristics of various sensor data in relation to model predicted values. A holistic drilling optimization index is thus derived by aggregating all this information. This index coupled with the drilling dysfunction prediction ultimately enables recommendation of drilling parameter corrections. |The drilling optimization index has been integrated into a drilling rig data aggregation system currently in operation on twenty rigs in North America. The system has access to real-time data, both at low frequency (less than 1 Hz) as well as data in the 1 to 10 Hz range, and also contextual data (such as data typically available in a tour sheet or well plan). In deploying the system, human factors aspects were given significant consideration. A typical driller is not familiar with concepts such as Bayesian networks, MSE, etc. By displaying the effectiveness of drilling as a single, dimensionless parameter, an index that varies between 0 and 1, with 0 representing inefficient drilling and 1 representing optimal drilling, the message is effectively communicated to the driller. The index is currently depicted in a very intuitive ""speedometer"" type of visual. Values are low and closer to 0 when dysfunctions occur, and when that happens suggestions are provided on how to mitigate the dysfunctions. These suggestions are visually presented in the form of operational cones in the WOB-RPM space. Additionally, the variation of the index with drilling depth is displayed to enable the driller to identify how formation changes impact drilling performance. This was found to be useful to drilling engineers who are generally tasked with optimizing the drilling process.|","Drilling Dysfunction Identification, Human Factors, Drilling Optimization Index, Decision Support System, Bayesian Network"

The collapse resistance is usually calculated by use of formulas suggested by API TR 5C3 (2008) or ISO/TR 10400 (2007). If the collapse load is very small, whereas the tension stress and/or internal pressure are high, the collapse SF could be very large, which is unrealistic because the load point is close to the collapse envelope. This paper presents a vector approach for the collapse-SF calculation to overcome this problem. Moreover, the application of this vector approach can be properly extended to the calculation of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) connector SF for arbitrary load combinations. |The new SF is named the vector SF. It is the multiplier that would scale the load-point vector to reach the strength envelope in stress space. It must meet the following requirement: When all the tubular loads (axial force, internal pressure, and external pressure) are scaled by this SF, the load point must fall exactly on the failure envelope. Therefore, for American Petroleum Institute (API) collapse, the new SF must simultaneously satisfy the API TR 5C3 (2008) collapse formulas and the through-load-point radial-line equation. Ridders’ method (Ridders 1979) is used to solve the SF for a specific load case. The algorithm has been implemented in a casing-design computer program (Landmark 2017) and integrated with commercial software. This vector approach has been applied to both pipe body and connectors. |Example cases are used to study the effect of the vector approach on the collapse-SF values. The collapse-SF value is observed to become much smaller when the effective axial stress (actual axial stress plus internal pressure) is very high, which is expected because of the much-smaller vector collapse resistance (at the cross point of the radial line with the collapse curve). When the effective axial stress is not positive, the collapse SF slightly changes. A North Sea high-pressure/high-temperature well is also presented. The results indicate that the vector collapse SF is more realistic. In particular, it is most conservative in load cases with high effective axial stresses. |In summary, it is shown that the vector approach to calculate the SF is equivalent to the current method of comparing the von Mises equivalent stress with the material yield strength (YS). The vector SF has critical safety implications for load cases in which high effective axial stresses exist. Its software implementation can certainly assist well engineers with more-conservative and more-straightforward tubular design.|","collapse, tubular design, ISO connectors, safety factor, vector approach"

Pichon, F. Cafardi, G.D. Cavazzoli, A. Diaz, and M.R. Lederhos, Schlumberger, prepared for the 2017 SPE Latin America and Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference, Buenos Aires, 17–19 May. The paper has not been peer reviewed. |The boom in organic shale plays has revealed the critical need to size hydraulic-fracture treatments correctly to achieve commercial success. The right balance must be found between the cost of fracturing and the additional production achieved by increasing the formation-to-wellbore contact area. The complete paper examines a range of completion scenarios to evaluate the relationship between hydraulic-fracture design, production, and well profitability by use of numerical simulations to guide completion of horizontal wells in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta Shale. |Introduction |The Vaca Muerta Shale is the source rock of most of the producing formations in the Neuquen Basin, with high potential as a standalone reservoir. The first well aiming at testing production from the play was drilled and completed in 2010, and, at the end of 2016, the production from the formation involved more than 600 wells. Well-construction practices have moved from creating vertical wells to creating horizontal wells. |In any organic shale play, completion has a significant weight in the total well cost and must be sized adequately. Completion design is composed of the volume and number of hydraulic fractures to be created along the lateral, and it must be engineered according to the specific features of each formation. |One of the principal features of an organic shale reservoir is the absence of commercial production unless the well is hydraulically fractured. Enhancing the contact area between the formation and the wellbore with hydraulic fractures compensates for the extremely low permeability of these formations. Multiple factors, including geomechanics and stress direction, drive the geometry of the hydraulic fractures. However, it must be noted that most organic shale reservoirs are overpressured. This factor tends to drive the stresses up and reduce their horizontal anisotropy. |Besides the hydraulic-fracture geometry, production is also the result of the hydrocarbon volume in place and the interaction of the flow capacities between the reservoir and the created network of conductive fractures. Therefore, the size of this surface of exchange created by the hydraulic fractures has a critical effect on the level and dynamics of the production profile. |Finally, economics is the balance between total well cost and production. The completion design affects both production and total well cost, making it a critical parameter. |Fracturing-to-Production Integrated Work Flow |Work-Flow Requirements. With the primary objective being the combined evaluation of completion design, hydraulic-fracture geometry, production, and economics, the methodology must allow an explicit description, at  either the input or output level, of each one of the aforementioned parameters. The fracturing-to-production work flow fits this purpose and is proposed for this study. The work flow has been implemented successfully in the Vaca Muerta and various other shale plays.|","Document Type

Quite Possibly Next Decade |Stephen Rassenfoss, JPT Emerging Technology Senior Editor |The biggest unconventional oil producers have revolutionized global oil markets and driven down prices. Still on the list of things to do: Consistently turn in strong profits. |By the next decade, that is likely to change according to a report by Wood Mackenzie, which predicts margins will grow for the biggest, most efficient independents around 2020. |The actual prediction is “the five leading tight-oil specialists will start to deliver significant positive free cash flow in three years’ time, based on our USD 66/bbl Brent oil price assumption for 2020.” |Which would mean that five companies whose business depends on producing liquids and gas from ultratight formations—Continental, Devon, EOG, Newfield, and Pioneer—would begin generating considerably more cash than they are spending to produce far more barrels of oil per day than they are now. |“They will be transitioning out of the capital-intensive phase and moving into the harvest phase” as these enormous, long-term developments reach critical mass, said Benjamin Shattuck, principal upstream analyst for Wood Mackenzie, who was part of the team that produced the recent report: When Will Tight Oil Make Money? |Three Alternative Paths To Maximizing Unconventional Resources |Stephen Whitfield, Senior Staff Writer |As pioneering shale gas plays and tight oil formations mature and decline in production, operators are trying to find emerging formations and resources to replace them, enabling continued growth in US production. While the industry will continue identifying new domestic unconventional shale and tight sand resources, an expert said that the methods of discovery may differ from traditional approaches. |At the 2017 Unconventional Resources Technology Conference, Vello Kuuskraa discussed the alternative pathways companies may take to discover unconventional resources while maximizing existing plays in the near future. Kuuskraa is president of Advanced Resources International. |Kuuskraa’s presentation focused on three such pathways. He defined the first, “Looking in Your Own Backyard,” as the search for additional productive horizons in existing basins, either above or below already developed target formations. An example of such a strategy is the Meramec formation, located approximately 1,000 ft above the Cana-Woodford Shale in the northern portion of the Anadarko Basin. |A Typical Well is Hard To Define |Stephen Rassenfoss, JPT Emerging Technology Senior Editor |A type curve is a quick way to answer a critical question—what does a typical well produce over time in a given place? |On the plus side this simple calculation can be done using only basic math skills. “The conventional approach is to determine the arithmetic average of production during a given month from different wells in a reservoir of interest to create a type well,” according to SPE 178525. |On the downside, the next sentence is: “This method is deeply flawed.” |The flaws include “different results by different evaluators” that are “overestimates or underestimates (usually overestimates” of future production, according to the paper, whose authors include John Lee, a professor at Texas A&M University who is well known for his work on reservoir production analysis. |The negatives have become all the more pronounced by the rise of unconventional oil and gas developments, where the output varies, and is unpredictable from well to well, with decline curves that do not fit conventional norms. |“The problems are simply different (and usually harder to solve) in unconventionals,” Lee said. |Validating the Smooth Success of HEAL System |Trent Jacobs, JPT Digital Editor |It has apparently taken one emerging technology to help validate another. |HEAL Systems is a joint-venture with Schlumberger which manufactures a downhole flow-regulating device by the same name. The innovation promises to remedy one of the unconventional sector’s most common problems: slug flow. |PipeFractionalFlow is a spinoff startup from the University of Texas at Austin that is using new theories and equations to make modeling complex multiphase more affordable. |Together, the two technology developers completed a simulation and history matching study on four horizontal wells in the US and Canada that shed light on how the HEAL system works. The research is detailed in an SPE paper published at the Unconventional Resources Technology Conference (URTeC 2670789). |Study Provides Guidelines for Community Input in Unconventional Development |Stephen Whitfield, Senior Staff Writer |A lack of community input can have a destructive impact on new unconventional energy projects, particularly in environmentally sensitive areas. However, a recent study conducted by Texas A&M University and the Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC) showed that while negative community opinion can be difficult for owners and operators to overcome, engaging in a dialogue with communities pre-development could have significant economic, social, and environmental benefits and should be a factor in any evaluation of a new project. |Speaking on the second day of the Unconventional Resources Technology Conference, Clark Adams, a professor emeritus in the Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences department at Texas A&M, outlined some of the steps companies could take to address community anxieties over new energy development. These steps were explained in a paper (URTeC 2664652) written by Marian Higgins, David Burnett, Urs Kreuter, and Richard Haut.|","Document Type

The foundation is installed at a water depth of 23 meters and in soil conditions with layers of dense sand and stiff clay. The mono bucket foundation has a diameter of 15 meters and a skirt length of 7.5 meters. The presented data are the water surface elevation, the inclination of the bucket lid, and the generation of excess pore pressure inside the bucket, which contain data from a half year of measurements. The measurements show that the structure has been exposed to more than one severe storm. This paper describes the behaviour of the mono bucket foundation in terms of rotation and excess pore pressure generation. The measurements are used to identify the general behaviour of the full-size mono bucket foundation and show evidence of the presence of suction pressures generated during impact loads, which creates undrained moment and uplift forces. |Introduction |In September 2013 a mono bucket foundation was installed at Dogger Bank, supporting a meteorological measuring mast, which in the industry is referred to as a met mast (see Fig. 1). The purpose of the erection was to collect data concerning the environmental conditions at the location, which is used in the design of a wind farm. |A mono bucket foundation consists of three parts: the skirt on the bottom, the lid in the middle, and the shaft on top, as shown in Fig. 2. A platform was mounted on top of the shaft, on which the met mast was fixed. In order to document the behaviour of the foundation, various transducers were installed on the mono bucket foundation and platform. Only the transducers from which measurements are used in this paper will be presented here: wave radar, pressure transducers, inclinometers, and accelerometers. The location of the pressure transducer is shown in Fig. 2. |The wave radar is mounted on a platform at the top of the shaft and measures the distance to the water surface. The pressure transducers, inclinometers, and accelerometers, from which data are presented, are all mounted on the lid of the foundation. The pressure transducers are mounted below the lid in order to measure the pore pressure in the soil inside the mono bucket foundation. The inclinometers and accelerometers are all installed on the top side of the lid. The accelerometers are mounted on both the lid and the platform. |On September 23, 2013 data collection of the measurements of all transducers started, and the results shown in this paper are from the first half year after installation.|","Dogger Bank,  rotation,  pore pressure,  monitoring, Mono bucket foundation"

M., Norwegian University of Science and Technology| Bauer, A., SINTEF Petroleum Research| Larsen, I., SINTEF Petroleum Research","|ABSTRACT: Pore pressure reduction, caused by reservoir fluid production, will alter the stresses in the vicinity of a producer. These stress alterations affect the propagation of hydraulic fractures that originate e.g. during water or polymer injection into injector wells as part of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or improvement of geothermal well productivity. In this study, we use a modified discrete element model (MDEM), coupled to the fluid-flow simulator Tough2, to investigate how hydraulic fractures are affected when growing into a zone of altered pore pressure. The study shows that flow induced stress changes can have a significant effect on hydraulic fracture propagation. Hydraulic fractures tend to bend around the producer, and the degree of deviation from the far stress field is dependent on several factors, including production rate, time, reservoir permeability, stress anisotropy and Poisson’s ratio. The stress alterations show a high sensitivity to stress anisotropy and are also affected by Poisson’s ratio.
1. INTRODUCTION
Local stress alterations can cause deviation from the far-field stress and are important to identify for accurate reservoir management. The stress regime is commonly believed to govern fracture propagation, and local changes in the stress regime can influence hydraulic fracturing treatments and fractures created as a result of water or polymer injection. Injection treatments relevant to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations, as well as to operations in the geothermal industry. For example in the case where well stimulation is performed on the margins of a geothermal field with a history of prior operations.
Pore pressure changes in the reservoir during production or injection affect the effective stresses, and can cause a rotation of the principal stresses. Generally, production will increase the compressive stresses in the tangential direction and injection will increase the compressive stresses in the radial direction (Hidayati et al, 2001). If the rotation is great enough, hydraulic fractures growing in the affected region can deviate from what is anticipated by the far-field stress. It is therefore of importance to look at how hydraulic fractures are affected when growing in the vicinity of pressure-depletion induced stress changes, and under what conditions the effect is significant.|","Document Type

We perform triaxial direct shear experiments to evaluate the permeability potential of freshly created fractures as a function of stress/depth using specimens of carbonate-rich Marcellus Shale. Applied confining stress ranged from 2 to 30 MPa, specimens were 25 mm diameter and 25 mm length, shearing displacement of at least 2 mm was imposed, and measured permeability ranged between 10<U+2212>3 and 104 mD as dependent on stress and fracture conditions. Simultaneous X-ray video and computed tomography were used to directly measure fracture displacement and apertures. Results show that the stress at which fractures form is likely the most significant factor controlling fracture permeability, with higher stresses causing significant 2 to 4 orders of magnitude permeability reduction. The effect of creating fractures at high stress on permeability reduction was significantly stronger than the effect of increasing the confining stress on an existing fracture. Results included analysis of transient fracture permeability following renewed shear displacement, a process which resulted in rapid permeability enhancement followed by a slower decay in permeability.
1. INTRODUCTION
Permeability of existing and/or potential fractures in the subsurface is a key parameter for subsurface fluid flow modeling, as relevant for a sustainable energy future and preservation of potable aquifers. Previous studies have investigated fracture permeability in relation to the so-called ‘cubic-law’ (Witherspoon et al., 1980; Zimmerman and Bovarsson, 1996) in which fracture aperture can be related to fluid conductivity if complexities arising from surface roughness and asperity contacts are adequately taken into account. This ‘effective’ hydraulic aperture is dependent upon the state of stress on the fracture (Barton et al., 1985, Brown, 1987; Cho et al., 2013; Gutierrez et al., 2000; Pyrak-Nolte and Morris, 2000; Zhang et al., 2007) and shearing displacement along the fracture (Bandis et al., 1983; Detwiler and Morris, 2014; Gentier et al., 1997; Lee and Cho, 2002; Olsson and Brown, 1993; Yeo et al., 1988). In addition there are temporal effects including chemical dissolution and precipitation (Armitage et al., 2013; Detwiler, 2010; Noriel, 2015), mobilization and filtering of fines (Oliveira et al., 2014; You et al., 2015), and mechanical self-sealing (Bastiaens et al., 2007; Elkhoury et al., 2015). No previous studies, known to the authors, have attempted to investigate the permeability of fractures that are created at in situ stress conditions. Such conditions are directly relevant for evaluating the potential for stimulation or creation of permeable fractures, whether by natural phenomena, such as faulting, or by human activity, such as fluid injection.|","Document Type

Thus, the fracture toughness of rocks changes, which affects the extension of the hydraulic fracture. In order to research the fracture toughness of rocks with different water-oil saturations, the authors put forward a new method to saturate the samples, and a series of experiments on sandstone with different saturations ranging from 100 percent oil to 100 percent water were carried out, with the modified three-point bending test. After the experimental works, several interesting conclusions were reached: (1) the fracture toughness of specimen containing water and oil decreases by 30-50 percent compared with the dry specimen; (2) when there is only one kind saturated fluid, the fracture toughness of the oil-saturated rock is higher than that of water-saturated; (3) in the saturant fluid of water-oil two-phase system, as water saturation goes up the rock fracture toughness decreases drastically. Basing on experimental data, the authors give the theoretical analysis from two aspects: energy conservation and chemical reactions.
1. INTRODUCTION
The oil reservoirs are the porous rocks filled with fluids. During the long-term production, the properties of the rocks would change with changing of oil and water saturation, which in turn affects the later reproduction.
Many researches on rock properties affected by water have been done over a long time. Najmud (Najmud et al., 1990) proposed the experiment method and concluded that as water saturation goes up, the rock cohesive strength, shear strength, Young’s modulus and compressive strength decrease, based on measurements on sandstone under dry condition and different levels of saturation ranging from 100 percent oil to 100 percent brine. Gaussmann used equations to predict changes in seismic properties resulting from different pore-fluid saturations (Han and Batzle, 2004). Lai (Lai et al., 2015) studied the effects of mineralogy and the water content on tensile strength of organic-rich shales, and discovered that the imbibed water significantly reduces the tensile strength. Vernal H. Kenner (Kenner et al., 1982) conducted a series of tests to determine the effect of moisture content on fracture toughness, and an obvious decrease in KI with increasing storage relative humidity was observed. Meng (Meng et al., 2005) concluded that increases in water content could lead to higher molecule activity, which suggests that the water content affects rock strength and elastic properties.|","Document Type

It is thought that the chemical processes may be accelerated under thermal conditions.

1. INTRODUCTION
The fluctuation of rock fracture friction has been recognized as one of the major causes in fault mechanical behavior. In previous studies, Dieterich (1979) and Ruina (1983) proposed a famous empirical rate- and state- dependent friction (RSF) law. This law could well describe the variation of rock friction as observed in the slide-hold-slide direct shear test. Since, then a large number of researches related to the earthquake’s occurrences were conducted based on this friction law [e.g. Stuart and Tullis, 1995, Marone 1998]. The authors has been carried out the Slide-Hold-Slide(SHS) type direct shear tests of rock fracture including natural joint surface roughness under relative low confining (Kishida et al., 2011; Kawaguchi et al., 2009). Kishida et al. (2011) have confirmed that the shear strength recovery during short-time holding may be attributed to a purely mechanical process, like creep deformation at the contacted asperities, while the shear strength recovery during long-time holding is affected by both mechanical and chemical processes. Kishida et al. (2011) and Kawaguchi et al. (2009) were conducted under room temperature, and then, the influence of various thermal conditions was not considered.
In this research work, direct shear tests have been carried out under two different temperature conditions following a SHS process in a residual state employing mortar replica specimen, granite and andesite with a single joint surface roughness. Then, the RSF law has been applied to the experimental results and the influence in temperature has been discussed.|","Document Type

The discrete particle modeling approach provides a tool to simulate complex behavior, such as rock failure, based on relatively simple laws describing the relevant inter- and intragranular contact mechanics. In this paper, challenges in building models, calibrating the required model parameters, and analyzing the results of simulations, are described. The numerical results are compared with controlled laboratory experiments on three different sandstones. Strength at different confining pressures and the transition between dilatant and contractant behavior appears well described by the model, as does stress dependence of ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities. Accounting properly for sub-grid features and upscaling to core scale and beyond remain challenges primarily limited by computational efficiency.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rocks are geologic materials which are heterogeneous and discontinuous when examined at different scales. Heterogeneity and discontinuities are essential to the mechanical properties of rocks when they are considered as construction materials in engineering, such as around a wellbore in petroleum engineering or a tunnel in rock engineering. Therefore, it is common knowledge that usually faults and joints, both their geometrical settings and surface properties are dominating factors to be considered when evaluating, e.g., the stability of tunnels.
Even for a piece of so-called intact rock as studied in the laboratory, the rock specimens are still heterogeneous and discontinuous, e.g., when looking at the grain scale. Heterogeneity and discontinuity influence the mechanical properties of a rock specimen as well as those of a rock mass. Therefore, in order to understand the mechanical properties of rock at large scale, it may be necessary to understand it in the small scale.
Using 2D or 3D pore scale images as a basis for estimating petrophysical properties of rocks is by now well-established (e.g. Bakke and Oren, 1997; Dvorkin et al., 2009; Andra et al., 2013a and 2013b). Computation of rock mechanical parameters and rock behavior during failure on the basis of similar data is less well developed. Most approaches so far have been based on finite element numerical techniques (e.g. Arns et al., 2000). In this paper, we will present an approach utilizing discrete particle modeling (Holt et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015), discuss its limitations and view its potential for further development. In Section 2, we summarize previous work to demonstrate the applicability of discrete particle modeling towards a qualitative understanding of the impact on the grain scale on rock behavior. Section 3 will focus on the road towards quantitative modeling of rock properties based on real microstructures from <U+03BC>CT data. Challenges relate to resolution (fine details of contact geometry are important for mechanical behavior), sample size (large representative elementary volumes), computational time (linked to the above), grain partitioning and description of multi-mineral composite rocks, plus selection of input parameters for the grain contacts. In Section 4, results of simulations will be shown, including stress - strain curves and associated behavior of static moduli and strength parameters. Simulated stress dependence of P- and S-wave velocities will be shown, and the numerical predictions will be compared with results from corresponding laboratory tests. Finally, concluding remarks are made on Section 5.|","Document Type

Consequently, the geomechanical characterization of reservoir rock formations is mostly based on wireline log indicators, calibrated against values measured on limited and potentially biased populations of core samples.
Best practice for the geomechanical characterization of reservoirs should start with the careful verification of selected empirical models against relevant, project specific core data. Unfortunately the available core data is in most cases not fit for this purpose and the choice of an empirical model for the upscaling of core data becomes somewhat arbitrary. In this paper we review some of the main sources of uncertainty pertaining to standard core analysis workflows relying on sparse measurements obtained from the testing of plug samples and describe how continuous high resolution profiles of properties such as rock strength and ultrasonic velocity profiles obtained from the scratch test should be combined in order to reduce the uncertainty inherent to the upscaling of mechanical properties. Examples from real case studies show these enhancements include precise core shift estimates, early and adhoc recommendations for the selection of plug samples dedicated to complex and expensive rock mechanical testing programs, the quality-checking and the selection of the most appropriate wireline logs for the upscaling of data measured on plugs, and the building of robust empirical relationships for a better prediction of rock mechanical parameters in nearby offset wells.
1. INTRODUCTION
Case studies for subsurface geomechanics offer many examples of the critical importance of reliable core data for the calibration of well and reservoir models. Unfortunately in many instances, measurements taken for the purpose of reducing key uncertainties are too scarce and come too late in the workflow to have a real impact on the quality of models and their predictions. Under these circumstances, models are poorly conditioned, reactive instead of predictive, and sometimes too inaccurate to assist engineers for necessary decisions about well designs and field management options.|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
As a direct object of slope, foundation and underground caverns, the rock mass is a kind of natural geological body, which has been subjected to various geological processes in the course of a long geological history and has retained various permanent deformation signs and geological structures in the interior. Due to the existence of various joint planes in the rock mass which control the stability of the rock mass, the engineering rock mass is far from the continuous deformation body, and whether a method can be widely used in rock stability analysis depends largely on whether the joint planes of the rock mass are simulated and calculated in a reasonable way.
Block Theory (also known as Key Block Theory) is such an effective method for engineering rock mass stability analysis. Since it was proposed and established by Goodman and Shi Gen-hua, 1985, many researchers have promoted it from the joints geometric characteristics of distribution, physical properties, mechanical behavior of blocks and other factors (Li et al., 2010). Combined with modern mathematical methods, they analyzed the stability of rock mass and recognized the law of deformation and failure process of rock mass, for providing scientific and reasonable suggestions for engineering planning, design, construction and reinforcement.|","Document Type

The Breccia, Weathered Shale and Breccia on Weathered Shale samples were loosely-placed and tested dry, representing the bulk of the waste rock dump volume in the field. The Weathered Shale on compacted clay was tested under both dry and wet (the worst case) conditions to represent the interface between Weathered Shale and compacted clay liners within waste rock dumps. The peak shear and normal stresses were corrected for area reduction and plotted to provide the shear strength envelopes, from which shear strength parameters were recommended. To assess the potential for breakdown of the waste rock on wetting, particle size distribution curves were obtained by dry and wet sieving. Also, slake durability indices were obtained for Breccia and Weathered Shale by carrying out slake durability tests. Overall, the results indicated negligible potential for breakdown of the Breccia and Weathered Shale on wetting.
1. INTRODUCTION
As a part of the mining of metalliferous ores, excavated overburden needs to be dumped in a nearby storage, usually a surface waste rock dump. The side slopes of a surface waste rock dump form at the angle of repose of the mine wastes, which is typically in the range from 35° to 40° (Williams, 2001, 2014, and 2015). Such slopes are normally not compacted and are subjected to rainfall, making the geotechnical stability of loose-dumped waste rock slopes a significant concern for mining and geotechnical engineers. Figure 1 shows a photograph of a slope formed by end-dumping mine waste rock from a truck.
The angle of repose of a dump is often simply adopted as the friction angle of the mine waste. However, the angle of repose represents the loosest possible packing under virtually no normal stress or the friction angle at the critical state (Williams 1996). The waste rock would be expected to have a friction angle of typically 4° to 6° higher than the angle of repose of the material on loose-dumping, due to the effects of overburden stress (Williams, 2015). At angle of repose of the mine waste, the dumps are generally geotechnically stable, at least in the short-term. In the long-term, however, water and weathering of the material are the major causes of slope instability, and it has been found that subsequent failures are generally rainfall-related (Chowdhury and Nguyen, 1987; Fourie, 1996; Williams, 2015). It is also well documented that the shear strength of dry material is higher than that of saturated or submerged samples (Kjaernsli and Sande, 1963; Fredlund et al., 1978). In waste rock dump slopes, the shear strength decreases significantly with decreasing matric suction associated with increasing moisture content caused by rainfall infiltration (Fredlund and Rahardjo 1993). Therefore, when the dumps regularly experience high infiltration rates due to prolonged rainfall events over the wet season, failures will be more likely to occur. Rainfall-induced slope failures in waste rock dumps are common hazards in the wetter regions of the world.|","Document Type

B., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign| Elbanna, A., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","|ABSTRACT: We propose an interfacial contact/damage model for simulating dynamic fracture in rocks. An interfacial damage parameter, D, models the evolution of damage on fracture interfaces, while relative contact and contact-stick fractions model contact-separation and stick-slip transitions. The damage rate is determined by an effective stress, written as a scalar function of the normal and tangential components of the Riemann traction solution for assumed bonded conditions. We propose alternative definitions of the effective stress that generate failure criteria that resemble the Tresca and Mohr-Coulomb criteria for compressive stress states, and we compare their compressive strengths and fracture angles under a compressive loading. We adopt a stochastic Weibull model for crack-nucleation in which cracks nucleate at points where the effective stress exceeds the probabilistic fracture strength. We implement the nucleation model with an h-adaptive asynchronous spacetime discontinuous Galerkin (aSDG) method that captures accurately the complex fracture patterns that arise under dynamic loading conditions. Numerical examples illustrate the effects on fracture response of varying the stochastic nucleation parameters and the alternative definitions of the effective stress.
1 INTRODUCTION
Understanding the stress states that cause rock failure is critical to the reliable analysis and safe design of structures in rocks. In situ rock is typically subjected to compressive stress fields, and experimental observations indicate that the compressive strength of rock increases with increasing confining pressure. Failure occurs by shearing along planes oriented at a rock-type-specific angle, <U+03B8>, defined relative to the direction of maximum compressive stress [1]. Failure criteria describe the variation of compressive strength with confining pressure and, in general, the stress states at which rock fails.
A number of failure criteria have been proposed in rock mechanics. The Tresca criterion assumes that a material fails on planes with maximum shear stress. While it is sometimes used for failure analysis of rock [2], the Tresca criterion is more appropriate for ductile materials as its corresponding shear strength is independent of the confinement pressure. The Mohr-Coulomb (MC) failure criterion depends linearly on the normal and shear stress components. This implies a linear relation between confinement pressure and compressive strength. However, this straight-line relation does not always fit experimental data [3], and the extension of the linear relation into the tensile loading regime generally over-predicts the tensile strength of rock. Experiments show that the rates of increase of the shear and compressive strengths decrease as confinement pressure increases. In fact, beyond a certain confinement pressure, rock reaches a critical state at which the shear strength no longer increases, similar to the constant shear strength of the Tresca model [4]. Beyond the limitations associated with linearity of the Mohr-Coulomb model, various studies demonstrate that fully three-dimensional failure criteria are required to capture the influence of the intermediate principal stress [5-8]. However, due to its simplicity and the challenges involved in calibrating the more advanced models, the Mohr-Coulomb model is still the most popular and widely used-failure criterion for rock.|","Document Type

J., The University of Queensland| Serati, M., The University of Queensland","|ABSTRACT: The scalping of crushed rock produced in a quarry is required to produce aggregates of a range of sizes, for various applications such as use in road pavements and retaining walls. Large-scale (300 mm by 300 mm by up to 190 mm high) laboratory direct shear box tests were carried out on a crushed aggregate scalped to pass 75 mm, 37.5 mm, 19 mm, 9.5 mm, 4.75 mm and 2.36 mm, to study the effect of scalping on its shear strength. Scalped specimens were air-dried and loosely-placed in the shear box to represent loose-dumping of dry aggregate in the field, and were then subjected to single-stage testing under applied normal stresses of 250 kPa, 500 kPa or 1000 kPa. In general, the failure envelopes obtained tended to flatten with increasing degree of scalping (i.e., reducing maximum particle size). Both the inferred friction angle and the apparent cohesion tended to decrease with increasing degree of scalping. In addition, sieving analyses were carried out before and after the direct shear tests on the 75 mm, 37.5 mm, and 19 mm scalped specimens, to assess the degree of particle breakdown on loading and shearing. The results imply that small-scale laboratory testing of aggregates, necessitating scalped specimens, will generate conservative shear strength parameters.
1. INTRODUCTION
Shear strength parameters of granular soil are commonly determined by carrying out single-stage laboratory direct shear tests; for example, according to ASTM D3080. The shear strength parameters are essential for safe design for many geotechnical applications, such as bearing capacity, lateral earth pressures on retaining walls and pavement design. However, mainly due to the relatively small scale of a conventional direct shear box (60 mm by 60 mm or 100 mm by 100 mm, and a height of only about 20 mm, in particular), granular soils often need to be scalped prior to testing, involving the removal of particles larger than a nominal maximum of five times the height of the shear box. This is to ensure that there will be sufficient particles over the height of the specimen to generate shear along the interface between the two halves of the direct shear box, without forcing shear through particles. When testing coarse-grained aggregates, a large-scale direct shear box is preferred over a small-scale direct shear box, since it better represents the full-scale samples (ASTM D5321; Bauer and Zhao 1993, Alfaro et al. 1995; Bakeer et al. 1998; Yu et al. 2006, Abdelrahman et al. 2008; Nakao and Fityus 2008; Liu et al. 2009a, b; Arulrajah et al 2013).
The shear strength characteristics of coarse-grained aggregates are related to their particle size, shape, hardness, crushability, surface roughness and other aggregate properties (Vallerga et al. 1957; Cerato and Lutenegger 2006; Wu et al. 2008; Gupta 2009; Ueda et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2013; Kim and Ha 2014). Given that scalping can significantly change the particle size distribution of the sample, it is expected that scalping would also impact the shear strength characteristics of aggregates. In this paper, the effect of scalping on the shear strength of aggregates was investigated by carrying out single-stage, large-scale direct shear tests on various scalpings under applied normal stresses of 250 kPa, 500 kPa or 1000 kPa. In addition, sieving analyses were carried out before and after the direct shear tests on selected scalpings to assess the degree of particle breakdown on loading and shearing under an applied normal stress of 1000 kPa.|","Document Type

M., NTNU| Fj<U+00E6>r, E., SINTEF and NTNU| Larsen, I., SINTEF","|ABSTRACT: Natural barriers formed by e.g. creeping or plastic shale may provide a solution to plugging and abandonment of old oil and gas wells. In order to qualify a sealing barrier outside the casing, it has to be identified by sonic and ultrasonic logging through casing methods. Rock mechanical laboratory experiments accompanied by ultrasonic velocity measurements on soft overburden shales from North Sea fields have been analyzed in order to provide possible attributes that can be related to shale barriers. Shale failure and plastification is associated with small velocity changes. This means that velocities of plastic and creeping shales may be assessed by e.g. comparison with open hole log data.
1. INTRODUCTION
Sealing of new wells, in addition to plug and abandonment (P & A) of old hydrocarbon wells, are required in order to prevent future leakage of fluids from the reservoir to the surface. Traditionally, cement plugs have been placed at the casing shoe during the drilling operation, while requirements for permanent sealing barriers are generally much stricter. The associated costs of P & A with today's technology could be huge. As an example, estimates show that 15 rigs will need 40 years full time operation to seal all wells on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (Straume, 2013). It is therefore a growing demand from the oil industry to establish new technology that may reduce the costs and the time required for qualified P & A operations.
Field experience has validated that shales may form natural barriers around cased wells (Williams et al., 2009). Since most shales in nature have permeabilities in the nanoDarcy range, while oil well cement permeability is of the order 1-100 <U+03BC>Darcy (Goode, 1962), shale barriers are potentially more reliable seals than cement. Since nature does most of the job by itself, it is also a far cheaper solution to plug and abandonment than conventional cement plugging.|","Document Type

"388","2017-0686","Extension Failure Mechanisms Explain Failure Initiation in Deep Tunnels and Critical Heights of Cliff Faces and Near-Vertical Mountain Walls","Barton, N., Nick Barton & Associates| Shen, B., CSIRO Energy","|ABSTRACT: Brittle rock can fail due to extension strain over-coming the tensile limit, even when all stresses are compressive. Two related topics can thereby be addressed. The first is extension strain-induced failure in deep tunnels and mines, with fracture initiation in tension but subsequent propagation in shear. The familiar ratio of maximum tangential stress <U+03C3><U+03B8> / UCS of 0.4 ±0.1 signifying rock fracture initiation, and the initiation of acoustic emission, are each explained by the ratio of tensile and compressive strength and by Poisson’s ratio, using a classic elastic equation and simple arithmetic. The maximum critical tangential stress <U+03C3><U+03B8> can actually be expressed as the ratio of tensile strength and Poisson’s ratio <U+03C3>t/<U+03BD>, hence the ratio 0.4±0.1. The second related topic is the limited heights of mountain walls, seen from the perspective of rock climbing. Limited in this case is a relative term: 1,000m to 1,350m of almost vertical meters challenge all rock climbers. This ‘big-wall’ range of heights is not exceeded anywhere in the world. Although strong granites are often involved, large-scale tensile strengths are apparently no larger than about 5 to 10MPa, due to weakening from temperature-cycling. At the other end of the spectrum, cliff houses in Cappadocia tuffs in Turkey may become exposed at intervals, due to extension failure of 15-20m high cliffs, with in situ tensile strengths of only 0.1MPa. Mountain heights limited to 8-9km can be explained by non-linear critical state rock mechanics: maximum shear strength is the limitation.
1. INTRODUCTION TO TUNNEL FRACTURES
Why do tunnels in massive rock start to exhibit fracture initiation when the ratio of the assumed maximum tangential stress <U+03C3><U+03B8> reaches approximately 0.4 x UCS? Why does acoustic emission in a laboratory compression test initiate at a similar ratio of principal stress and uniaxial compressive strength? Why do vertical cliffs in the ultra-weak Cappadocia tuffs in central Turkey tend to fail and expose underground dwellings or churches at intervals of a few decades or centuries, when their heights are even as little as 10 to 20 m? Why do the highest vertical mountain faces in the world of rock climbing range from ‘no more’ than 1,200 to 1,300m in height? Why did the first TBM tunnel in the world (1880) fail at its haunches when it curved beneath only a 70m high chalk cliff next to the Channel Tunnel, which was built 110 years later?|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Block Theory (Goodman and Shi, 1985) has been invented for more than 30 years, and has become a basic theory in Rock Engineering. Taking advantages of its practical and simple features, it has been widely recognized by industry. The classic Block Theory (Goodman and Shi, 1985) has developed rather mature, so the later researchers made some additions (Zhang and Wu, 2005; Li et. al., 2010) to it, but most of the researchers just use Block Theory to analyze block stabilities in specific cases (Elmouttie and Poropat, 2010; Daz et. al., 2005; Chun et. al., 2005; Zhang and Wu, 2007). Although Block Theory has such advantages, lacking mature software for it has greatly restricts its development and application. There are 11 Block Theory programs developed by Dr. Shi, one of the inventors of this theory, that all use ASCII files as input with different format. Furthermore, some programs are related to the others. Users need to understand the parameters of every module and know the relationships between these modules, which is not convenient and error prone. Considering this, this paper presents software architecture for Block Theory and implements it as software easyKBT: (1)The software reorganizes and encapsulates computing kernels of 8 key programs: 4 tunnel modules, 2 slope modules and 2 block stability analysis modules; (2) this software gives short explanation for every parameter, analyses the relationships between modules and designs a computing architecture for the 8 modules; (3) the software provides user friendly Graphical User Interface (Fig. 1) that can help users do Block Theory analysis seamlessly; (4) analysis results of the modules are exported automatically which is convenient for printing.|","Document Type

Y., Sandia National Laboratories| Doe, T. W., Golder Associates| Haimson, B. C., University of Wisconsin-Madison| Oldenburg, C. M., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory| Dobson, P. F., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","|ABSTRACT: We conducted a series of in situ stress measurements in a 100-meter deep hole (kISMET 003) drilled vertically from the 4850-ft level (1478-meters depth) of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) located in Lead, South Dakota. We used the method of hydraulic fracturing for in situ stress measurements (Haimson and Cornet, 2003) at total overburden depths between 1520 and 1550 meters The minimum horizontal stress magnitudes were taken to be the shut-in pressures obtained from dP/dt analysis (Lee and Haimson, 1989) of pressurization cycles 3 and 4 in each test. The values ranged between 20.0 and 24.1 MPa (2900 and 3494 psi), and averaged 21.7 MPa (3146 psi). The direction of maximum principal stress was obtained from analysis of an acoustic borehole televiewer log following the hydraulic fracturing. The fractures are striking at an average of N86°E with a dip of 78° to the southeast. The fact that the fractures are not following foliation but have a non-vertical, though very steep, dip indicates that one of the principal stresses may be inclined slightly off vertical.
1. INTRODUCTION
The University of Wisconsin-Madison, Sandia National Laboratories, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory conducted hydraulic fracturing and stimulation experiments as part of the kISMET project (Oldenburg et al., 2016, 2017) sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) SubTER (Subsurface Technology and Engineering Research, Development and Demonstration) cross-cut initiative. The kISMET experiments meet objectives in SubTER’s “stress” pillar and the “new subsurface signals” pillar by testing the monitoring of fracturing using active seismic, electrical resistivity tomography, and passive microseismic monitoring. The kISMET facility is located at the 4850L (1478-m depth) in the West Access Drift near the Davis Campus of SURF (Fig. 1). The tests were conducted in the central hole, kISMET-003 of a five-spot pattern (Oldenburg et al., 2016, 2017). The borehole is vertical with a 7.6 cm diameter and 100-m length located in the zone of Precambrian metamorphic phyllite.|","Document Type

This parameter is conventionally measured by diamond drilling to obtain core, and testing core samples in the laboratory, which is an expensive and time consuming process. It would be ideal if the strength of the intact rock could be estimated in the field as an in-situ measurement by running a device inside a borehole. Estimation of the rock strength by scratch tests has been reasonably accurate. Application of this concept for the assessment of rock strength in a borehole has led to development of a borehole strength measurement probe, namely Rock Strength Borehole Probe (RSBP). RSBP is designed to scratch the surface of rock with a miniature disc cutter inside a relatively slim borehole. The cutting forces are measured and used to estimate the rock strength. This paper discusses the background theories and experimental tests conducted for development of the RSBP, along with formulas developed for estimating the compressive and tensile strengths of the intact rocks. The RSBP probe and its components are briefly explained, and the observations from the initial field experiments with this probe are discussed in this paper.
1. INTRODUCTION
Good understanding of rock mass behavior is essential for engineering design of structures in rock mass and related geomechnical analyses. The proper use of rock mass models allows for obtaining meaningful outputs for safe design practices. One of the key properties of intact rock, which is widely used for assessment of rock mass properties and its behavior, is its compressive strength. Conventionally, rock strength is measured by testing core samples that are obtained from exploration boreholes or drilling into boulders collected from outcrops. Despite all the efforts and costs, the results may not necessarily show the behavior of the intact rock in the field since the test cannot provide the in-situ condition of the ground. Moreover, the tested samples are solely representative of few locations along the borehole. Moreover, there is always a time lag between the field work and the time where the results could become available for design purposes. Therefore, the ideal solution is to measure the rock strength in-situ, and preferably inside closely placed drill holes.|","Document Type

W., Sichuan University| Dai, F., Sichuan University| Xiao, P. W., China Guodian Dadu River Hydropower Development Co., Ltd.","|ABSTRACT: Numerous hydropower projects build the underground powerhouses in Southwest China subject to the topography conditions and structure layout. The underground powerhouse is one of the most significant structures that will be permanent in use. Large scale excavation usually poses a threat to the stability of the underground powerhouse and the surrounding rock mass damage is required to be qualified for excavation schedule and support design. Various methods such as displacement measurement, acoustic wave test and numerical calculation have been used to quantify the rock mass damage. As a new monitoring method in hydropower underground powerhouse, the microseismic (MS) monitoring technique has been rarely used for quantifying surrounding rock mass damage. In the present study, an MS monitoring system was established to capture the microcracks induced by excavation of the underground powerhouse at the Houziyan hydropower station and a damage-driven numerical model based on MS data is adopted to quantify the surrounding rock mass damage. The rock mass is degraded and simulated by a micromechanics-based constitutive model described by the fracture density, which is determined by the amount and size of the microcracks. The material property input for this model are Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio of the intact rock and the MS information such as the location and the source size calculated from seismic source parameters. A typical profile (#2 unit profile) of the underground powerhouse is selected for damage analysis. Combined with field excavation process, the related MS data are imported to the numerical model for damage calculation. The results show that the surface displacement of each bench excavation of the underground powerhouse using the damage-driven numerical model is approximately 30-40 mm larger than that using the original elastic model. Furthermore, the displacements of rock mass considering the effect of MS damage are in good agreement with the field measurement.|","Document Type

W., Sichuan University| Dai, F., Sichuan University| Gu, G. K., China Three Gorges Corporation| Liu, K., China Three Gorges Corporation","|ABSTRACT: To assess the stability of large-scale underground caverns excavated in a layered rock mass with layers dipping steeply inside the surrounding rock, a high-resolution microseismic monitoring system was carried out in the right underground powerhouse of the Wudongde hydropower station in Southwest China. The progressive processes of layered rock mass damage including the initiation, propagation, coalescence and interaction of rock micro-fractures, was first demonstrated by analyzing the temporal and spatial distribution of microseismic activities. Meanwhile, the microseismic monitoring results were validated using conventional monitoring data and field observations. A typical failure of layered rock masses was fortunately monitored and the evolution of the microseismicity and its corresponding mechanism during the development of this studied failure were also obtained. The results can provide us an overall understanding of the progressive damage and failure evolution of large-scale underground openings in bedded rock masses.
1. INTRODUCTION
Layered rock masses, formed by preexisting original materials on the earth crust, are distributed widely over land area. During the forming process of this kind of rock mass, differences in material composition, particle size, color and fabric result in rock stratification. Consequently, one set of dominant and parallel discontinuities, called a bedding plane, are generated. As can be expected, well-developed geological discontinuities (i.e. bedding planes) of layered rock strata play a vital role on the stability of layered rock-engineering projects and in particular on their modes of failure. Hence, the mechanics of the failure mechanism in stratified rock masses has its own distinctive feature. In addition, many large-scale underground openings have to be constructed recently in stratified rock masses due to their universal distribution. Therefore, it is of significance to study the failure modes and mechanism of underground openings in layered rock masses.
Macroscopic deformation or catastrophic failure of the surrounding rock masses usually resulted from the initiation, propagation and coalescence of micro-fractures inside the rock masses. Therefore, it is crucial to effectively capture the micro-fractures for understanding the in situ failure process of rock masses. Microseismic (MS) monitoring techniques, involving three-dimensional and real-time monitoring of seismic waves generated by the ruptures in rocks, have been successfully developed into an effective approach to understand the progressive damage and failure evolution of surrounding rock masses in many underground engineering projects. For instance, Cai et al., (2001) quantified the rock mass damage in underground excavations from MS events that were monitored at the Mine-by test tunnel of the Canada Atomic Energy Limited Company. Dai et al., (2016) and Ma et al., (2016) investigated the failure mechanisms of surrounding rock masses during the construction phase of large-scale caverns, based on the temporal and spatial distribution of MS events. By analyzing the results of MS monitoring data, a field survey and scanning electron microscopy data, Xiao et al., (2016) revealed the mechanism of evolution of stress-structure controlled collapses of surrounding rock in caverns. This suggests that the MS monitoring technique could be employed for better analyzing the stability of large-scale underground powerhouse caverns.|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Earthquake shaking is one of the main agents of landslide generation (Keefer, 1984 & 2000). Geological conditions, topography, vibration acceleration, and etc. are all related with the stability of a slope under the condition of earthquake. Bhasin (2004) provided that the presence or absence of discontinuities has a profound influence on the stability of rock slopes. A study was prompted by observations, during the San Fernando earthquake of February 9, 1971, of topographically correlated high accelerations (Nason, 1971). Mohraz (1976) examined the effects of geological conditions on the response spectra and the ground-motion parameters such as peak ground acceleration, velocity, and displacement. The Pacoima Dam strong-motion record, showing several high-frequency (approximately 10 Hz) peaks over 1 g, was recorded on an accelerograph located on a steep ridge in a region of pronounced relief (Trifunac and Hudson, 1971). Boore (1972) reported several instances where churned ground and overturned boulders were observed following earthquakes. These observations, indicative of accelerations greater than 1 g, were noted only on ridge crests or other topographically high features. Davis (1973) concluded that topography plays a significant role and is an important consideration in determining the seismic motion that a particular site receives.
Xu and Wang (2009 carried on the model experiment which regards the Xiaochang bedding landslide that is because of the earthquake in Diexi in 1933 as the prototype occurred on August 25, 1933. The result showed that when the vibration acceleration reaches a critical value, the slope model will deform and random fractures appeared. The degree of damage is connected with the amplitude, the first motion direction, the track of vibration, and the strength of rock mass. With the increase of vibration acceleration, the degree of damage will increase. When vibration acceleration level continues to increase, the slope will show a wide range of the instability to the overall damage consequently. When the shear and tensile cracks expand to the deeper place the movement between the layers will move. The main failure mode is the “tensile-shearing” and the landslide will form at last. The information above is acquired through physical models, and the numerical method should be involved to study the acceleration vibration rules.|","Document Type

To investigate the soil behavior of a case study in Tehran, as the capital and most crowded and populated city in Iran, the urban noises data were being recorded for 52 minutes by a microtremor as the cyclic loading. To evaluate the possible different impacts of regular and irregular cyclic loading on soil behavior, the irregular (real) urban noises data were converted to regular (modified) data. The result showed that although the total amounts of stress were equal in both regular and irregular data, the caused displacements were fairly different. The maximum displacements were about 0.254 and 0.501 mm for real and modified data in 52 minutes. On the other hand, using Li and Selig's equation and employing modified data in numerical analysis, the constant parameters for each soil type of the case study were determined by the Li and Selig's equation using modified data. The results showed that numerical analysis results agreed well with the former investigations which have been done using lab tests.
1. INTRODUCTION
Slope stability analysis has been always one of the main concerns of geotechnical engineering (Chowdhury et al., 2009). Only in Asia, landslide and mass movement disasters have adversely affected 8.4 million people and killed more than 26 thousand persons, from 1932 to 2016 (Guha-Sapir et al., 2016). Many factors are effective on the stability of slopes such as slope geometry, geology setting, water table, material properties and in-situ and dynamic stress such as earthquakes (Eberhardt, 2003). The static, pseudo-static and dynamic (man-made or natural) slope stability analyses are the methods which have widely made attempts to figure out more realistic, accurate and practical results in simulating safe and economic slope behavior (Cheng and Lau, 2014).
Limit equilibrium and finite element methods are the most used methods to analyze slopes among engineers and reported in many papers (Ugai and Leshchinsky, 1995; Aryal, 2006; Cheng et al., 2007; Hammouri et al., 2008). Limit equilibrium method can be employed in static and pseudo-static analyses, while finite element method (as a numerical method) is capable of doing dynamic analysis which studies the effect of dynamic loading, mainly earthquake, blast, etc., on slope stability. Moreover, the realistic analyses of deformation have also become possible by the invention and development of finite element methods in the late 1960s (Duncan, 1993).|","Document Type

Nicolas, The University of Texas at Austin","|ABSTRACT: CO2 geological sequestration can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. The injection of CO2 can alter mechanical properties of the host geological formation due to the interaction between CO2, resident fluid in the pores, and rock minerals. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for such alterations are still not fully understood. This study explores mechanisms of rock alteration due to exposure to CO2-rich brine through the modeling and analysis of micro-scratch tests. The discrete element method (DEM) and bonded-particle model (BPM) are used to perform numerical modeling of the scratch test simulating a sphero-conical stylus scratch on a random packing of bonded spherical grains. The microscopic parameters used in DEM/BPM are calibrated by conducting numerical triaxial compression tests. Numerical results of the scratch test are compared against experimental results on Entrada sandstone. Scratch toughness is correlated positively with the cement bond size, which appears to be the most appropriate parameter to explain the alteration of Entrada sandstone caused by CO2. There appears to be a transition from brittle to ductile failure in the scratch failure mode as the bond size decreases. This work provides insight on how microscopic bond properties alters macroscopic mechanical properties of cemented sandstones.
1. INTRODUCTION
CO2 capture and sequestration in deep geologic formations is considered as an economical and environmentally sound approach to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption. The injection of CO2 into host formations will shift the subsurface geochemical conditions away from equilibrium. This shift can lead to reactions between rock minerals and CO2-water mixtures (Hovorka et al., 2006, 2013; Bachu et al., 2007; Carroll et al., 2011). The petrophysical and geomechanical properties of reservoir and caprock formations at CO2 storage sites can be significantly altered due to long-term contact with CO2-rich brine (Rutqvist and Tsang, 2002; Espinoza et al., 2011; Rinehart et al., 2014; Renard et al., 2008; Rohmer et al., 2016). Chemo-mechanical coupled processes are expected to be triggered by CO2 injection into brine aquifers. For example, chemically aided fracture growth could be a detriment to caprock integrity, facilitating leaks of buoyant CO2.|","Document Type

"398","2017-0664","Conversion of Dynamic Mechanical Property Calculations to Static Values for Geomechanical Modeling","Yale, D. P., Yale Geomechanics Consulting| Swami, V., CGG Services (Canada) Ltd.","|ABSTRACT: Relationships between “dynamic” mechanical properties (calculated from seismic or acoustic log velocities) and “static” mechanical properties (measured during triaxial testing of core samples) are important because dynamic values are more prevelant and easier to obtain but static values are critical for geomechanical, reservoir, and completions modeling of likely deformation and stresses in the subsurface formations
A large number of studies over the past few decades have examined both the relationship between static and dynamic moduli and the causes of the differences between the moduli. We have compiled and analyzed the results from over 50 published studies to determine both a set of correlations to determine static moduli from dynamic measurements and to see if there is a consistent rationale for the differences between them. The correlations developed here can serve as a good “80% solution” to determine static properties from dynamic measurements when field specific data is not available.
1. BACKGROUND
For perfectly elastic materials, the mechanical properties calculated from measured compressional and shear acoustic velocities through the materials (dynamic moduli) are the same as those calculated from measurements of strain response of the material due to an applied stress during standard triaxial compression testing (static moduli) (Ledbetter, 1993). However, nearly all geomaterials are not perfectly elastic and thus the dynamic properties calculated from log or seismic velocities can be quite different from static properties calculated from triaxial testing of core material.
The static properties are much more indicative of the deformation that occurs in the subsurface due to the production or injection of fluids into the subsurface, the deformation of subsurface formations due to tectonically applied loads, or the removal of material from the subsurface due to mining. Therefore, correlations between the dynamic and static properties are critical to using log or seismic based measurements to get a much wider understanding of mechanical properties in the subsurface than can be obtained from limited sampling and testing of core materials brought up from the subsurface. Geomechanical modeling to predict deformation and stress development in the subsurface needs both the broad understanding of the variability of moduli throughout the subsurface formations of interest as well as the most accurate values of properteis representing the type of deformation being modeled.|","Document Type

M., Metis/UPMC| Pazdniakou, A., Metis/UPMC","|ABSTRACT: Numerical tools were developed which are able to address acoustic wave propagation in dry and saturated porous media. Lattice methods, namely the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the lattice spring model (LSM), can be successfully used for this purpose. The resulting code can upscale porous media properties or study direct time simulations in complex media. Only the second application is detailed here. Various media which contain or not a cavity, which possess uniform properties or not, which are flat or not are generated; an explosion is simulated and the accelerations are measured at the surface. The data show that when the medium is simple, the cavity can be easily located, which is not the case when it is random in volume or in surface.
1. INTRODUCTION
Propagation of acoustic waves in saturated porous media is of large theoretical and practical interest in many areas of engineering. These studies were initiated by Biot (1956a,b) for low- and high-frequency acoustic waves propagating in a porous medium made of an elastic solid material saturated by a viscous compressible fluid.
In order to avoid time dependence, the problem can be addressed by the homogenization theory (Boutin and Auriault, 1990; Sanchez-Palencia, 1980) in statistically homogeneous saturated porous media. A series of local problems defined on the unit cell are solved and the solutions are averaged over the unit cell in order to calculate the macroscopic parameters characterizing the porous medium, namely the effective stiffness tensor, the dynamic permeability, and the coefficients describing the reaction of the solid matrix to the fluid pressure. Then, the generalized Christoffel equation (Malinouskaya, 2007) is solved in order to calculate the macroscopic acoustic velocities. The three macroscopic propagation modes can be predicted.
The direct simulation of the propagation of acoustic waves through saturated (or not) porous media can be done by using LSM and LBM. This approach is adopted here in order to analyze the influence of cavities on wave propagation.|","Document Type

The formation studied in the earlier work and here is the Jurassic, early-Cretaceous Vaca Muerta formation in the Neuquen basin in Argentina. In this earlier work, mineralized ""veins"" were noted to be prevalent and complicated, sometimes being shear weak interfaces while in other cases they were not. This work looks specifically at the formation mechanisms and composition chemistry of the veins, to better understand why some are planes of weakness. This work shows how observations from core samples of the direction of crystal growth and the vein composition can help predict weak or strong interfaces, and suggests that ultimately high-resolution borehole logs may be better able to predict interfaces. The research focuses on understanding the planes of weakness, as it is now well accepted that such planes of weakness can significantly affect hydraulic fracture propagation during well completions. |1. INTRODUCTION |Experiments of hydraulic fracturing and observations of natural fracturing in outcrops indicate that rock fabric, particularly weak interfaces, plays a significant role in controlling fracture propagation and in the generation of branches or step-overs (Thiercelin, 2005; Jefferies, 2010; Detournay, 2012; Suarez-Rivera, et al. 2006; Green, 2013; Suarez-Rivera et al., 2016; Ptaszynska et al., 2016). The interfaces suppress fracture height growth by absorbing hydraulic energy and are responsible for localized leak off (Warpinski, 1987; Suarez-Rivera et al., 2011 & 2013; Green, 2013 & 2014; Ptaszynska et al., 2016). |Weak interfaces tend to be the interface between hard and soft sediments. The interfaces are frequent in mudstone reservoirs and exist at multiple scales. The regularity of these interfaces is dependent on the cyclical nature of geological processes. The interfaces between the formation layers may be narrow or thick, abrupt or transitional, depending also on specific conditions of deposition (Green, 2013; Ptaszynska et al., 2016; Suarez-Rivera et al., 2016).|","Document Type

When roadways are placed in them, clay minerals are exposed to water and humidity and will absorb water rapidly and generate pressures that can break apart the weakly bonded rock, leading to a progressive strength degradation and consequently a severe closure (i.e., squeezing) of the roadway. In this study, numerical simulation was carried out to investigate the mechanisms of roadway squeezing using UDEC Trigon approach. The strength degradation is simulated by gradually reducing the cohesion and tensile strength of the contacts between blocks in the UDEC Trigon model. The strength is not reduced everywhere throughout the model but only at failed (either in tension or in shear) contacts because moisture is considered to intrude into rock through cracks. When a contact fails, its cohesion and tensile strength are gradually reduced as a function of calculation time. The numerical study aims to realistically capture the squeezing process of the surrounding rock mass of roadway due to strength degradation.
1. INTRODUCTION
In underground coal mining practice, a majority of rocks are composed of clay minerals, feldspar, quartz clastics, and a small fraction of other silicate and carbonate minerals. Shales probably are the most common and can be composed of 50-80% clay materials (Molinda and Klemetti 2008). Clay materials have a platy structure and can absorb water. Water absorption causes swelling, which may loosen bedding and break apart the flat- bedded material structure, resulting in rock deterioration (Huang et al. 1986). Considerable researches have been carried out to study the swelling characteristics of shale. The propensity for swelling is controlled by the mineralogical composition of the rock, for example the presence of swelling clay minerals and the higher the water absorption, the higher the degree of swelling (Olivertra 1990). Huang et al. (1995) carried out a series of laboratory tests and the results showed that the temperature of the shale had the least influence on swelling of shale, while the air humidity and the moisture activity index had a significant influence. Zhang et al. (2004) found that the low strength of shale is also correlated with low Young's modulus and low shear strength.|","Document Type

However, this process could not be solved by conventional FEM. In this paper we introduce discontinuous DDA (Discontinuous Deformation analysis) and particle MPS (Moving Particle Simulation) analysis to solve a complex solid and fluid interaction problem, especially rock and water mixed debris flow. This study presents a new approach in which rock block movement is solved by DDA and water flow inside the rock mass is solved by MPS (Moving Particle Simulation) method separately. Then they are coupled in the calculation to account for the mutual interaction. To analyze the coupling between the water flow and the falling blocks of rock, this study introduces the equivalent external forces for the falling blocks of rock caused by the water flow. The velocities are calculated for the fluid flow based on MPS. MPS analyzes the part of fluid alone and DDA analyzes the part of solid alone to set the initial state of the analysis. After the results is superimposed, the coupling analysis is carried out.
1. INTRODUCTION
Topographically the mountainous area in Japan occupy about 70% of the whole country and the earthquake and volcanic activities is very dynamic. The disaster due to earthquake and heavy rain has occurred frequently. In particular, the scale of slope disaster due to heavy rain tends to increase in recent years. Many researchers and the government have tried to predict the occurrence and damage of slope disasters. The analytic method also has been applied to the estimation of the damage, however it is not always successful. One of the reason is considered that continuum method such as FEM is applied to analyze the phenomenon with large movement and a breakdown occurring in slope disasters. On the other hand, discontinuous method such as Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) (Shi and Goodman, 1989) and Distinct Element Method (DEM) (Cundall, 1971) has also been used as analyses methods of the slope disasters. However, these methods cannot handle the mixed body of fluid and solid material appropriately. It is known that the water explicitly affect stability of rock slope and debris flow is a mixture of water and rock blocks.
Recently, a particle method, which is one of mesh free methods, has been used to analyze water movement. The particle method is simple but powerful method to solve the problem of fluid mechanics. In this paper we introduce the discontinuous DDA and particle MPS (Moving Particle Simulation) analysis to solve a complex solid and fluid interaction problem, especially rock and water mixed debris flow. In the analysis of the coupling between the water flow and falling blocks of rock, the equivalent external for the falling blocks of rock caused by the water flow is introduced.|","Document Type

In addition, mineral composition analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were performed to characterize the microfabric of the samples, and the morphology, size and distribution of the pores for Bakken samples. This work is especially useful for the optimization of the drilling activities, as well as the hydraulic fracturing operations in Bakken.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Bakken Formation is one of the oil-bearing strata in the Williston Basin and it underlies parts of North Dakota, Montana, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba (Figure 1). The Devonian-Mississippian age Bakken formation consists of three members: the Upper Bakken is about 20 ft thick black marine shale; the Middle Bakken is 30-80 ft thick interbedded layer of limestone, siltstone, dolomite, and sandstone; and the Lower Bakken is 10-50 ft thick black marine shale (LeFever, 2005).
Bakken Formation is overlaid by the Mississippian age Lodgepole Limestone formation and is underlaid by the Devonian age as shown in Figure 2. The lithology of the Middle Bakken varies somewhat unpredictably from a light-to-medium gray, very-dolomitic fine-grained siltstone to a very silty, fine-crystalline dolomite (Wang and Zeng, 2011). Dark carbonaceous mottles and partings are commonly present. The Middle member is often faintly laminated, and occasionally contains fine- scale cross-bedding (Wang and Zeng, 2011). The hydrocarbon source rocks are the Upper and Lower members, which are organic-rich, with total organic carbon (TOC) content ranging from 12 to 36 wt%, average 25 to 28 wt% over large portions of the basin (Tran et al., 2011). The Middle Bakken member, which is the primary oil target, is an organic-lean interval. The average depth of the Middle Bakken is about 10,000 ft. The porosity of the Middle Bakken is about 6% and the permeability averages 0.001-0.01 mD or less. Water saturation varies between 25% and 50% in the Middle Bakken (Cherian et al., 2012). The average oil gravity is about 42 °API. Gas oil ratio (GOR) ranges from 507 to 1,712 SCF/bbl, and the bubble point pressure varies from 1,617 to 3,403 psi (Nojabaei et al., 2013). The Bakken Formation is variably overpressured with pressure gradients up to 0.73 psi/ft in the central part of the basin (Meissner, 1978).|","Document Type

Although properties of rock fractures such as aperture, roughness, filling, contact area, and orientation are highly significant, limited effective methods exist for their investigation at a fundamental level. In this study, laboratory contact electrical resistance profiles are generated for limestone samples, and correlated with uniaxial compression stress measurements. Further, the observed paired resistance-stress laboratory results are simulated using an artificial neural network. Methods, results and analyses are presented to provide insights about complex processes involved in rock wall joint behavior.
1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Rock joints are important factors influencing rockmass properties, and significant experience and knowledge is required to make estimates of geologically disturbed rock mass properties (Hopkins, D. L., 2000). Irregular discontinuities, especially mining-induced fractures behind excavations, can pose large hazards toward mine or tunnel safety. However, there are currently limited approaches used effectively to detect the rock wall joint behavior beyond the exposed surface.
Electrical resistivity measurements are widely used as an important tool for exploring minerals, fluid content, porosity and degree of water saturation in rocks and soils (Loke et al. 2013). In mining and tunneling area, great research efforts have been conducted on the electrical properties of rocks, and the influencing factors of electrical such as water content, stress, fractures and temperature had been recognized (Brace et al., 1966, 1967, Brown, S.R. 1986). For instance, an order of magnitude of changes was observed when saturated rock samples were stressed to fracture from a wide variety of rocks (Brace and Orange, 1966). Moreover, resistivity of saturated rock samples under compressive stress rises or falls very slightly before half of the peak stress, and it falls rapidly after samples reaching 90% of the peak stress. This large decrease of resistivity results from new-created porosity in a saturated rock (Brace and Orange, 1968). Water content is the dominant factor affecting electrical resistivity of rocks, thus additional efforts on electrical resistivity of rocks can be done to correlate electrical resistivity with porosity, water content and conductivity of rockmass.|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
The AE/MS monitoring technique has been and continue to be used widely in the mining industry for slope stability studies in surface mines as well as ground control, rockburst and coal bump monitoring in underground mines. The life and safety of miners are constantly under threat due to uncertainties associated with rock mass stability as mining proceeds. Therefore, performing routine AE/MS monitoring in mines lead to the establishment of areas in the mine that are susceptible to seismicity. The information acquired during such monitoring activities can then be used as a planning tool for the prevention and control of possible rock mass instabilities which could lead to rockburst or slope failure (Mendecki et al., 1999, Mendecki et al., 2010). Mine operations in general involve the breaking and moving of material. As such, the occurrence of seismicity is a regular feature in mine operations.

The two-dimensional DDA has been testified and widely applied in slope stability analysis, underground excavation, etc. However, the development of three-dimensional DDA had been slow down due to its complexity. One of the intricate problems is lacking an efficient algorithm to build the computing model of rock systems, especially large-scale rock systems with tens of thousands of blocks. To address this problem, this paper presents a new block oriented cutting algorithm for three-dimensional DDA. Based on the geographical information, the computational domain and discontinuities, especially faults and joints represented by finite and infinite polygons, are generated at first. Then, through sequentially introducing all the discontinuities, the computing model was generated and could be applied for deformation, stability, fluid flow and or coupled analysis. Compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithm possessed several advantages such as lower algorithm complexity, better data independence and extremely convenient when dealing with re-cutting project.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock masses, consist of numerous complex rock blocks, play an important role in the field of rock engineering. Discontinuities in the rock masses possess irregular spatial distribution, size and orientation but usually follow probabilistic distributions. The discontinuities, especially faults and joints, have a considerable effect on the stability of the rock systems. Rock masses divided by intricate discontinuities into smaller rock blocks. Thus, rock blocks vary in size, shape and other geographical information. For the purpose of DDA computing, a throughout blocks model should be generated at first. The model requires a realistic computing model that should explicitly reflect the rock masses’ complete internal structures, intricate topological information and complicated geological data.
Broadly, based on how to introduce discontinuities, there exist two approaches to generate blocks system models to represent the rock mass. The first approach is based on sequential subdivision (Zhang et al., 2013; Boon et al., 2015), it means discontinuities are introduced sequentially. Each step just introduce one discontinuity. As shown in Figure.1, the first two figures is the result of instructing one joint, and the following two figures is the result of introducing next serval arbitrary joints. This approach mainly consist of two steps. Firstly, if one introduced discontinuity intersects with the original block, that block will be divided into two new separate blocks. This operation continues step by step till all discontinuities have been used. As more discontinuities introduced, the number of blocks increases. However, the generated blocks are all convex because this method supposed that each of the discontinuities could divide the block into two separate blocks. So next step aim to contrast more complex block based on the basic convex blocks that we got. In order to generate concave blocks and form more accurate block system model, the finiteness of discontinuities are considered. Thus some of the convex blocks combine to become concave blocks. By this means, the data structure of every block is maintained throughout the cutting process, which is very useful when apply this model to DDA or DEM. However, if large amount of the discontinuities is finite, it would be quite time-consuming to generate the final blocks system model.|","Document Type

For stimulating tight hydrocarbon reservoirs, the transfer of hydraulic load from hydraulically loaded to in-situ cracks, removal of hydraulic load, re-fracturing, and application of cyclic loading are all examples involving contact and separation mode reversal. We propose an interfacial damage model that incorporates all contact and separation modes by combining their corresponding dynamically consistent Riemann solutions. Instead of commonly used penalty method and Lagrange multiplier approach we propose a new regularization scheme—based on the interface displacement and separation velocity jumps— that smoothens contact-separation mode transitions, remedies ill-conditioning that may arise by using penalty methods, and provides a tunable maximum penetration. In addition, we propose an aperture-based regularization approach that enables smooth transfer of hydraulic load to in-situ cracks. Numerical results, obtained by an h-adaptive spacetime discontinuous Galerkin method, demonstrate accurate modeling of contact mode transitions and intersection of cracks in hydraulic fracturing.
1 INTRODUCTION
Given that rocks are often under confinement pressure, contact and friction play a critical role in rock mechanics. For problems involving crack propagation and intersection, transitions between separation, contact-stick, and contact-slip may occur. There are specifically several examples in the area of hydrocarbon reservoir characterization and stimulation. In hydraulic fracturing the interaction of a hydraulically loaded crack with in-situ cracks can result in various mode transitions for both cracks. For example, the hydraulically loaded crack can be arrested or change direction by the in-situ crack or penetrate through it. The fluid flow can also be diverted into the in-situ crack, in which case it experiences a contact to separation mode transition; cf. [1] for the review of such intersections and the types of mode transitions that may be involved.
The inverse of the aforementioned mode transition, i.e., separation to contact mode transition, occurs when the hydraulic load is released and crack surface are pulled back together. Understanding this transition, and the transition back to separation mode due to the re-application of hydraulic load becomes important in refracting applications; cyclic application of the loads that better stimulate a reservoir, as in [2,3], or re-fracturing a reservoir to reactivate hydraulic cracks or increase its productivity, cf. [4], are some applications that involve contact mode transitions.|","Document Type

L., The University of Tennessee Space Institute","|ABSTRACT: Hydraulic fracturing has been the most common approach to stimulate tight formations. The geometry of the wellbore and the time history of the hydraulic loading play important roles in induced fracture patterns. For example, generating multiple perforations in a wellbore is nowadays attracting more attention in oil industry to enhance gas recovery. The increased number of fractures can potentially enhance the yield of a reservoir by increasing the regions affected by hydraulic fractures. We use an h-adaptive spacetime discontinuous Galerkin method and an interfacial damage model to study the conditions for which the induced hydraulic fractures become effective and propagate in rock. Our results show that as the loading rate decreases, only a few of these fractures will propagate. As the loading rate increases, more perforations become active, until ultimately all result in crack propagation. Moreover, higher loading rates affect larger zones for each of the initial perforations by dynamic fracture features such as microcracking and crack bifurcation. Our study mainly focuses on stimulation techniques that induce fully dynamic loading on rocks; for example, high explosives detonate and sends a shock wave in rock. Given the limitations of hydraulic fracturing technique, we study the effectiveness of a hybrid approach where initial perforations similar to those for hydraulic fracturing are used as seeds of crack propagation under dynamic loading. Finally for very high rates of loading, we demonstrate that a stochastic approach for crack nucleation predicts more realistic fracture patterns than conventional approaches that assume a macroscopically uniform fracture strength for rock.
1 INTRODUCTION
Generating fractures in deep and tight formations has received a high priority in oil industry to enhance the productivity of low permeability reservoirs which are already in operation. The induced fractures interacting with natural fractures form an interface with rock matrix and the borehole to facilitate the oil extraction. In fact, fracture volume induced by a stimulation technique is negligible in comparison with the total reservoir volume; however, they provide an interface with matrix which is larger than the borehole. As a result, very small permeability values are sufficient for production in a fractured tight formation. Therefore, the formation of fracture networks with a widespread pattern is a critical key in increasing production of tight oil reservoirs. Some geological factors highly affect the formation of fracture networks: rock mineral composition, rock mechanical properties, natural fractures and stress field. The orientation of the natural fractures and the stress anisotropy in fractured formations highly affect the propagation of the hydraulic fracture and the formation of fracture networks [1, 2].|","Document Type

H., University of Colorado","|ABSTRACT: This work studies fracture propagation in the encasements of wellbores, and how extreme pore pressures and pressure rates affect their damage states. The initiation and evolution of fractures in poroelastic media often gives rise to discontinuous fields within computational problems. Such models present computational challenges due to the complexity of sharp discontinuities that arise during the finite element solution and also lack the ability to model fracture initiation. These challenges may be alleviated by using a phase field formulation of fracture mechanics, which introduces a continuous, diffusive scalar damage field around crack surfaces. We make use of a direct computation of the crack’s width, or joint opening, by using the gradient of the phase field in the damaged area. This is useful for determining the material’s fluid-mechanical properties, such as the calculation of Poiseuille-type flow that occurs within a sufficiently damaged medium. Using this approach, it can be shown that the evolution of such fractures in a porous medium can contribute to the material’s permeability, hence coupling fluid flow and damage within a material. Conversely, the movement of fluids through a damaged solid can influence the material’s fracture distribution driven by pore pressures, meaning that there is a two-way coupling of damage and fluid flow. Using the Sierra Mechanics code suite at Sandia National Laboratories, a phase-field model of fracture is developed which will allow a loose, two-way coupling of these physics for future implementations. We find the model’s ability to predict fractures initiated and propagated by increasing pore pressure to be consistent with fractures that occur from fluid injections. We also find that the joint openings calculated with this model will be helpful for implementing Poiseuille flow along fractures.
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Motivation
The coupled physics of pressurized fluids in porous rock and fracture propagation is essential in subsurface rock mechanics. Applications in fields such as hydrology deal with the distributions of contaminants in groundwater, which are often dependent on fracture distributions in the earth’s crust, and the phenomenon of fluid induced fault activation is of great interest in the field of geophysics. The concept of carbon sequestration is contingent upon pressurized fluids, and CO2, being contained within poroelastic substrates of the subsurface. In Martinez and Newell, 2015, it is shown that under certain pressure conditions, CO2 and brine will flow along existing joints and faults when an injection occurs at depth. This implies that the CO2 intended to be sequestered may leak over time.|","Document Type

L., The University of Tennessee Space Institute| Abedi, R., The University of Tennessee Space Institute","|ABSTRACT: Realistic fracture simulations in rock as a heterogeneous brittle material with significant inherent randomness, require the use of models that incorporate its inhomogeneities and statistical variability. Since brittle materials do not match ductile materials in dissipating energy in the bulk, their fracture response is highly dependent on the stochastic microscale distribution and strength of defects. The high dependence of their fracture progress on microstructural defects results in wide scatter in their ultimate strength and the so-called size effect. Our approach for incorporating randomness in rocks is based on the modeling of stochastic volume elements (SVEs). Although representative volume elements (RVEs) are more commonly used in solid mechanics, SVEs are more appropriate for fracture analysis since they ensure that the material randomness is maintained. They still average microscale features similar to RVEs, and provide a more economical solution approach than those methods that explicitly model all microcracks in rock. To create a random field for macroscopic fracture strength field, we first generate several realizations of rock with a prescribed crack density and distribution. SVEs are then constructed with their centers at known spatial position on these random realizations. Next, by using a moving window approach, where the SVE traverses the known positions in these random realizations, we obtain first and second moments of the target random field. Point-wise probability distribution function and spatial covariance function are derived and used to generate consistent realizations of random fields based on the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) method. Finally, such realizations will be used for the analysis of dynamic stimulation of a wellbore in a tight formation. A powerful and mesh adaptive spacetime discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is used for dynamic fracture simulations.
1 INTRODUCTION
Rocks, having highly random solid aggregates structure, are inhomogeneous at various scales. At microscale, heterogeneity is due to the presence of microcracks, granular microstructures which can include a large number of randomly oriented zones of potential failure in the form of grain boundaries. At macroscale, inherent homogeneity is the results of the matrix containing different rock types, and weak features such as faults and fracture networks. Rock inhomogeneities are crucial as they affect the continuum level mechanical characteristics such as strength, toughness, and elasticity properties of the material. These heterogeneities imposed by the rocks microstructure greatly influence the material peek and post-instability responses [1]. This is most evident in (quasi)brittle materials as they lack energy dissipative mechanisms to re-balance stresses induced by microscale stress concentrations. Another key aspect of brittle fracture, related to its dependence on material microstructure, is that for the same geometry and loading condition various crack patterns, ultimate loads, and absorbed energies can be experienced [2-5]. These observations emphasize the importance of including randomness in material properties of rock in its fracture analysis.|","Document Type

V., PPRIME| Thovert, J.-F., PPRIME","|ABSTRACT: Thermal convection is numerically computed in 3D fluid saturated fractured porous media. Fractures are inserted as 2D convex polygons, which are randomly located. The fluid is assumed to satisfy 2D and 3D Darcy's law in the fractures and in the porous medium, respectively; exchanges take place between these two structures. After some necessary comparisons with results relative to homogeneous porous media, systematic calculations are performed for Rayleigh numbers up to 150 for various values of the fracture density and the fracture aperture. The increase in output flux with fracture density is found to be linear over the range of fracture density tested. Moreover, the importance of the percolating character of the fracture network is emphasized. Finally, the effective medium approach is found to be precise only for small or large fracture densities.
1. INTRODUCTION
Simulation of natural convection in homogeneous porous media has attracted attention for many years (Horton and Rogers, 1945; Lapwood, 1948; Nield, 1968; Combarnous and Bories, 1974). To these few citations, many could be added. In contrast, only a few references can be cited for studies of natural convection through fractured porous media (Kolditz, 1995; Blocher et al., 2010; Bataille et al., 2006).
Recently, detailed determination of flow through fractured porous media has been successfully addressed and Adler et al., 2012 provide a systematic account of this theoretical and numerical effort.
The present work is also based on a three-dimensional discrete description of the fracture network and of the embedding matrix. Isotropic fracture networks are modeled, and the matrix is permeable.
Our main objective is to provide quantitative information about the influence of the network parameters such as the dimensionless fracture transmissivity and the dimensionless fracture density on the heat released by the whole system.
Another objective is to assess the validity of an homogeneous approach where the fractured porous medium is replaced by an homogeneous medium.|","Document Type

It is therefore critical to determine appropriate geomechanical properties of the host rock. The Cobourg limestone is found near surface in the Bowmanville quarry, which provides access to samples for direct shear and other geomechanical laboratory test programs. It is essential to develop correlations between the properties of the Cobourg limestone from the Bowmanville to Bruce sample source locations. This study presents a detailed mineralogy investigation to determine the composition of the Cobourg limestone at both locations using X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Mineral Liberation Analysis. The results are used to explain trends in laboratory direct shear test stiffness and strength properties of the Cobourg limestone from the Bowmanville and Bruce sites. |1. INTRODUCTION |Modern geotechnical numerical design is limited by conventional characterization and data collection practices, which do not capture detailed parameters of intact rock and rockmass structure necessary for input to sophisticated and powerful simulation tools. Furthermore, as modern underground excavations go deeper and enter into more high stress environments with complex excavation geometries and associated stress paths, healed structures within initially intact rock blocks such as sedimentary nodular boundaries (termed intrablock structure) are having an increasing influence on rockmass behaviour and should be included in modern geotechnical design. Given the comparatively complex and sophisticated numerical simulation and analysis techniques now practically available, this research is driven by the need for enhanced characterization of intrablock structure for inclusion in numerical analyses. Intrablock structure governs stress-driven behaviour at depth, gravity driven disintegration for large shallow spans, and controls ultimate fragmentation. |The role of sedimentary nodular intrablock structure in the Cobourg limestone on rockmass behaviour is an important consideration for the Canadian Deep Geological Repository (DGR) at the Bruce site for the permanent storage of Low and Intermediate Level nuclear waste that is being developed by the Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO).

The results of a detailed mineralogy investigation to determine the composition of the Cobourg limestone using powdered X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA) in concert are presented in this paper. In addition to baseline XRD tests to determine the major mineral constituents, treatment with hydrochloric acid, clay separation, and ethylene glycol procedures have been conducted to assess the clay mineral constituents. The mineralogies of the nodules and intrablock structures are assessed and compared using the MLA results across multiple thin sections.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Italian Railway Company (Rete Ferroviaria Italiana - RFI) has to manage the security along the lines. On many lines one of the biggest issue is the hydrogeological instability; even small amount of slopes material (rocks or debris) on the track ballast cause high-risk situations (Fig. 1) (Geertsema et al., 2009; Guerriero et al., 2013).
A priority map is needed to define where to invest the funds destinated to secure the railway line.
Different scales landslides inventories are available on the majority of the Italian territory, but they are not homogeneous and their cartographic scale is too low to analyse instabilities along railway corridors.
Furthermore the potential instability hazard is not considered.
There is also a lack of knowledge about the historical events, occurred on the railway tracks, and the stability conditions on track sides are not well known, both for what concerns natural slopes and for artificial trenches.|","Document Type

Various models have been proposed in the soil mechanics and granular media disciplines to simulate sand time-dependent behavior, but none have been found to be able to model the time-scaling behavior observed by Dudley et al., 1998. This paper presents a substantial review of prior creep modeling efforts in the literature and describes a new model that uses an iterative stress-strain path dependent algorithm calibrated to a set of laboratory creep tests that use a stress step increase and hold period protocol that shows time scaling behavior. The loading and creep behavior are characterized by a normalized density (equation) at a given time t defined as the ratio of current density to the initial one (equation). The model uses an iterative recursive algorithm of stress-normalized density dependency for both the stress increase and creep portions of the loading steps that is able to capture the complexity of the sand behavior. The creep stage behavior is explicitly modeled using a stretched exponential expression, which has the physical significance of an average macroscopic material response for the time dependent behavior of a large number of coupled elements with a spectrum of local relaxation times. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by applying the calibrated model to predict other independent tests that containing varying stress increments and hold periods. The incremental model predictions match very well the independent tests results as well as the entire set of experimental data.
1. INTRODUCTION
Sand is a typical member of a wide class of geomaterials, and at the same time is the most commonly used example of a granular media. Under certain conditions, it behaves like a solid, when a ‘jammed state’ is achieved, while in other conditions it can behave as a liquid or gas (although as a very unusual solid, liquid or gas) (Chakraborty and Behringer, 2009; Biroli, 2007; Goddard, 2014). We present first in Section 2 a substantial review of the modeling efforts of creep in sand to highlight the complexity and wide ranging work in this area, and provide perspective for the particular modeling strategy presented in this paper. Section 3 summarizes the experimental unconsolidated sand creep data showing the time-scaling creep behavior previously reported by Dudley et al., 1998. Section 4 describes a new creep modeling strategy that is able to reproduce this time-scaling behavior, and its calibration to a subset of the test data. Section 5 shows the calibrated model’s validation against measured data, including several substantially different tests not used in the model calibration. The paper concludes with a short summary discussion in Section 6.|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Laboratory study of the mechanical properties of reservoir rocks mainly focuses on elastic properties and strengths for the application of seismic data interpretation, well stability analysis or hydraulic fracturing. However, the viscous deformation of reservoir rocks also possesses great significances in predicting long-term response of reservoirs subjected to drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities. Previous studies have verified the elastic/viscoplastic deformations of unconsolidated reservoir sands (Chang et al., 1997; Hagin and Zoback, 2004a, b; Hagin and Zoback, 2007) and shales (Chang and Zoback, 2009; Li and Ghassemi, 2012; Sone 2012; Sone and Zoback, 2013a,b; Sone and Zoback, 2014; Yang and Zoback, 2016). A linear elasticity model would not be able to fully predict the geomechanical response of those viscoelastic reservoirs. In petroleum engineering, the time-dependent deformations of reservoirs may become important in following scenarios. Neglecting the viscous deformation of reservoirs may result in significant errors in predicting reservoir compaction during depletion (Hagin and Zoback, 2004b; Hagin and Zoback, 2007), and may also underestimate the surface subsidence or inaccurate forecasting of reservoir performance. In hydraulic fracturing, the fracture conductivity may be reduced due to the time-dependent proppant-embedment (Morales et al., 2011; Alramahi and Sundberg, 2012). Zoback and his colleagues’ studies have demonstrated that the viscous deformation of reservoir rocks would appreciably the in situ stress state as the time-dependent deformation relaxes differential stress (Sone and Zoback, 2014). And this stress relaxation would affect both the hydraulic fracturing process and the current stress state developed over geological time.|","Document Type

The main purpose of using diverters is to distribute the stimulation fluid uniformly between all clusters to enhance the ultimate production efficiency. However, although operators have been deploying this technology on a more widespread basis, they have not been as focused on the underlying mechanisms, physics and controlling parameters. The aim of this study is to use perforation-scale models to better understand particulate system plugging under downhole conditions and couple it to reservoir-scale simulations to thoroughly investigate the process and optimize the operational parameters accordingly. The proposed design engine and workflow enables operators to simulate multiple diversion scenarios, to compare the resulting fracture geometries, to assess stimulation efficiency, and to investigate the effect of diversion design on the production performance. Based on a field case study, our geomechanical analyses indicate that we can optimize the diverter design and customize operational parameters to enhance fracturing efficiency. Through accurate diverter design, operators are better equipped to develop uniform fractures from all planned clusters.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing and multistage completions along horizontal wells are widely used to improve hydrocarbon productivity from permeability-challenged formations. During a typical hydraulic fracturing operation, fracturing fluid is injected into a wellbore and penetrates a target formation above the formation pressure. Depending on the completion and pumping strategy, single or multiple tensile fractures can be initiated from wellbore wall and then extended into the target layers. Recent industry practices in North America have demonstrated the success of hydraulic fracturing technology for economic production from low- permeability reservoirs.
Induced-fracture characteristics and quality (such as length, height, extent, and conductivity) dictate the effectiveness of a hydraulic fracturing operation. However, several field cases indicate that only a limited number of planned clusters can contribute to the overall production [1, 2]. This anomaly can be attributed primarily to hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation in the near-wellbore and far-field regions.|","Document Type

If these changes are significant, they can create favorable conditions for fault reactivation by shear or tensile modes. In that scenario, the conditions that develop within reactivated fault zones can trigger potential geomechanical problems such as oil exudation, seismicity and loss of casing integrity. Therefore, it is necessary to forecast the geomechanical behavior of the field and establish limits for pressure changes within the reservoir. This paper deals with a methodology for the evaluation of fault reactivation and fluid migration, using 2D and 3D Finite Element models. In these models, discrete faults are introduced through zero thickness interface elements. The reactivation mechanisms and fluid migration are controlled by the Mohr-Coulomb plastification criterion. 2D and 3D geomechanical models of a field with a set of faults were built in order to compare their predictions. According to the results, different injection pressure limits can be obtained using 2D and 3D models. Furthermore, the 3D configuration of faults that intersect each other can create preferential flow paths for migration of fluids which are not observed in simplified 2D models.
1. INTRODUCTION
Oil and gas reservoirs structurally compartmentalized by sealing geological faults are found in different fields of the world. During the production phase, the sealing of stable faults can be compromised by the strains triggered by pressure changes within the reservoir. Those strains together with the geomechanical properties and the geometrical configuration of the rocks and faults, can alter significantly the stress state. Consequently, sealing faults can become reactivated or hydraulically conductive, causing potential geomechanical problems related to exudation, casing integrity among others (Segall et al., 1994; Morton, R., 2006; Chan & Zoback, 2007).
In the literature, several approaches have been used in order to characterize and forecast fault reactivation through the establishment of limits for pressure changes within the reservoir. Most of those approaches consider critical sections through 2D models. That avoids the use of complex domains and the high computational effort that the use of a 3D model demands. This strategy has been used by several researchers: Cappa and Rutqvist (2010), Mendes et al. (2010), Rutqvist et al. (2013), Rueda (2014) and Pereira et al. (2014).|","Document Type

P., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Ickes, T., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Viswanathan, H. S., Los Alamos National Laboratory","|ABSTRACT: While it is well appreciated that releasing stress from samples recovered from the subsurface must result in fracture relaxation and dilation, the impact of this on permeability is not well understood. A triaxial direct-shear experiment was performed to evaluate the impact of changing stress conditions on the permeability of a Utica shale specimen. The intact specimen was equilibrated at 22.2 MPa isotropic stress and 23°C with pre-fracture permeability < 0.03 mD. The specimen was fractured at 105 MPa direct-shear stress, as identified by stress drop and simultaneous x-ray imaging but with negligible effect on permeability. Subsequent reduction of isotropic stress to 7 and 4 MPa resulted in a slight increase in permeability to 0.12 mD. The specimen was then removed from the triaxial system but was preserved within its Teflon sleeve. Reinsertion into the triaxial device and retesting yielded permeability of 3.0 mD at 2 MPa that then declined to 0.35 mD at 8 MPa. Concurrent x-ray tomograms showed significant increased fracture apertures after the initial removal of stress and these remained open during stress-reapplication. The release and reapplication of stress resulted in a fracture system that did not reproduce the original, in situ fracture properties.
1. INTRODUCTION
The permeability of fractured rock is a key parameter in evaluating the performance of geologic systems including oil and gas (hydraulic fracturing), CO2 storage, nuclear waste disposal and geothermal energy. In these cases, the property of interest is the permeability of fractures at subsurface (in situ) conditions. In general, this cannot be directly measured or observed. In the field, effective permeability of fracture networks can be evaluated using pump tests; however, direct observations of individual fracture properties are limited to apertures, fracture density, etc., as inferred using techniques such as borehole imaging, samples recovered from the subsurface, and surface outcrop studies.
Laboratory studies of fracture-permeability relations are common and have produced very useful results (e.g., Cho et al., 2013; Davy et al., 2007; Edlmann et al. 2013; Zhang, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013), but the fractures are generally produced by saw-cuts or Brazilian testing methods that are unlikely to reproduce subsurface fracture properties. In some cases, natural fractures have been studied from borehole or outcrop samples (e.g., Gutierrez et al. 2000); however, these fractures, as with the results of direct field observations of fractures, may have modified properties due to significant stress perturbations that result from the transit of the specimen from subsurface conditions to the laboratory.|","Document Type

V.","|ABSTRACT: This paper considers the physics and solid and fluid mechanics relevant to sanding from weak or very weak sandstones, and then uses this understanding to suggest ways of designing screenless completions to take advantage of these aspects to avoid sand production. This is followed by a description of a scale-dependent approach to sand prediction. This takes grain size and production tunnel diameter into account within the conventional framework of in-situ stress, reservoir pressure and rock strength parameters. The influence of these factors on sand failure over the life-of-reservoir is treated. A brief discussion of the problem of predicting the rate of sand production is also included. The approach is demonstrated with a case study showing how wells in an old gas field, which were shut-in because of sand production, were recompleted using the sand failure prediction and design capabilities of the methodology presented to restore production, sand-free, to former rates.
1. IMPORTANCE OF SAND FAILURE
Sand failure can have a severe impact on the economics of an oil or gas field. Erosion of down-hole or surface components by sand can lead to loss of integrity and hydrocarbon leakage. Production rates from screenless completions may need to be reduced to limit solids either flowing to surface or filling the wells. Sand handling, either at surface or flushing from downhole, adds expense to lifting costs.
Sand failure and production can be a problem from the start of production if low sand strength or a high state of stress are not appreciated. Alternatively, early production may be sand-free, but as a reservoir depletes solids production can begin. Sand production either immediately or at some later stage in the life of the field may require costly intervention, management or retrofitting of exclusion devices (Andrews et al., 2005; Rawlins and Hewett, 2007). As the number of fields around the world with weak or depleted sand reservoirs increases, these experiences are likely to become more widespread. BP, for example, estimates that more than 60% of its production comes from sand-prone reservoirs (Liou, 2014). To manage the economics of a field and minimise capital expenditure, it is useful to know at the outset whether sand failure is a significant risk. This allows decisions to be made on the most effective completion strategy to manage sand failure for the life of the field.|","Document Type

Lane, Colorado School of Mines| Walton, Gabriel, Colorado School of Mines| Trainor-Guitton, Whitney J., Colorado School of Mines","|ABSTRACT: Rock, unlike most engineered materials, possesses a large degree of inherent variability in physical characteristics. This creates a number of unique challenges when creating engineering works involving rock. When characterizing a rock, engineers must collect sufficient data so that the epistemic uncertainty is small relative to the aleatory variability. The aleatory variability is an inherent characteristic of rockmasses, and refers to the natural variation within the rock, which occurs in even the most homogeneous rocks with uniform size, shape, and orientation of grains. Thus, while epistemic uncertainty, which relates to a lack of knowledge can be minimized, variability in the uniaxial compressive strength values contributes to the overall engineering property variability of the material, and needs to be understood in order to characterize a rock. To quantify the extent of spatial correlation, covariograms and semivariograms from core specimen images are calculated from a 2D covariogram and semivariogram image, and the quantitative metrics of spatial heterogeneity can be used to represent aleatory variability. This then can be applied to multiple rocks to qualify and quantify their relative geomechanical variability.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock displays an inherent degree of variability, even within the same lithological unit. This variability is often apparent in the mechanical properties of rocks, including their uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) values. This is problematic when attempting to determine how many specimens to test to adequately characterize the geomechanical properties of the rock. ISRM guidelines suggest testing enough specimens to “adequately represent the rock sample”, and indicate that the appropriate number “should be a function of the intrinsic variability of the rock”, but these guidelines are vague (Ulusay, 2014). Consider the rocks shown in Table 1. The rocks range from highly isotropic and consistent between representative specimens, such as the Indiana Limestone and the Stanstead Granite, to anisotropic, very heterogeneous, and having significant spatial variability between specimens, such as Metabasalt and Metagranodiorite. Notice how these less homogeneous rock types have a significantly higher variability in their UCS values than their more isotropic counterparts. This work will investigate the variability of the spatial texture of the five rocks in Table 1, and relate this to the variability of their strength values.|","Document Type

In geothermal reservoirs, reactivation (and possible propagation) of natural fractures is an important component of stimulation. Slip on these fractures induced Microearthquakes (MEQs) and the locations of MEQ events reveal aspects of stimulation. In this paper, we discuss a technique for extracting information about fractures orientations from MEQs. This is achieved by combining geomechanics and geostatistics to better constrain uncertainties in natural fracture properties. We develop a new Geomechanics-Based Stochastic Analysis of Microseismicity (GBSAM) to provide quantitative estimate of fractures orientations. In this work, the rock response to pore pressure is modeled using a line injection source to simulate water injection into a natural fracture network. Mahalanobis distance is then used to quantify the similarity between the distribution of MEQs (GMEQs) from the forward model and field-observed distribution of MEQs (TMEQs) to find the best GMEQs that fits the TMEQs. As an example, the GBSAM is applied to a data set of 344 MEQs recorded during phase 2.2 of Newberry Volcano EGS demonstration project, located 37 km south of Bend, Oregon. Borehole televiewer (BHTV) was used successfully to map the geometry of 351 fractures in the wellbore. Results from GBSAM show that the dip and dip direction of those fractures have good agreement with the field results from BHTV. This proposed method is a simple but effective way for interpreting MEQs for better characterizing reservoir stimulation.
1. INTRODUCTION
The geometry of fractures has a significant impact on the fluid flowing, thermal transport capabilities and mechanical stability of a rock mass. Fractures orientations, spacing, connectivity are important features that control network permeability. Despite their essential role in reservoir development, there still are uncertainties regarding direct and indirect diagnostic technologies for characterizing fractures orientations in in-situ environments is not well developed. In the last several decades, many methods have been used to constrain the uncertainty in measuring the fractures orientations. Borehole logging and camera and outcrop mapping are commonly suffered from lower dimensional limited exposures (Einstein and Baecher 1983, Williams and Johnson 2004, Li, Feng et al. 2013). Furthermore, the description of fracture geometries obtained from local field surveys has to upscale from the local scale to the entire reservoir which can cause loss of geometric characteristics of the fractures. The question of how to establish a reliable fracture pattern remain an unresolved issue in subsurface community. Thus, fracture pattern in numerical analysis are commonly treated in a stochastic framework (Leung and Zimmerman 2012, Berrone, Pieraccini et al. 2015, Farmahini-Farahani and Ghassemi 2015, Ghassemi and Tao 2016).|","Document Type

B., The University of Texas at Austin| Hudec, M. R., The University of Texas at Austin","|ABSTRACT: We use a transient, large-strain, forward geomechanical model to predict pore pressure evolution below an advancing salt sheet. We find that salt-sheet emplacement results in significant overpressures subsalt and a narrow drilling window. We show that these overpressures cause the effective stresses and hence the sediment strength to remain low beneath salt. As a result, mudrocks are failing during salt emplacement. We discuss that traditional, porosity-based workflows underpredict pressure beneath salt because they assume uniaxial conditions and do not account for shear-induced pore pressures. However, we show that shear (differential) stresses subsalt are high, and their contribution to overpressure significant. We model salt as solid viscoplastic and sediments as poro-elastoplastic materials, with consolidation properties that are based on experimental testing on mudrocks typical of the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, our transient evolutionary analysis incorporates the geologic loading history, accounts for shear-induced pore pressures and provides the complete stress tensor as well as pore pressure prediction over time.
1. INTRODUCTION
Prediction of pore pressure prior to drilling is crucial for the planning of safe and economic well trajectories, borehole stability and design of casing plans (Dodson 2004; Dutta 2002; Zhang 2013). It is also a key input in the exploration stage to determine the integrity of reservoir seals and regional hydrocarbon migration behavior. Pressure prediction has become particularly important in complex geologic settings: for example, a significant percentage of deepwater well costs near salt are attributed to abnormal pore pressures (Harrison et al. 2004; York et al. 2009)
It is generally recognized that elevated pore pressure results from loading. In sedimentary basins, the most common form of loading results from sedimentation. A well understood conceptual formulation is that sediments undergoing burial by sedimentation deform uniaxially. Under such conditions, volume changes are directly related to the vertical strain. The horizontal effective stress changes as a function of the vertical, thus stress and volume changes can be described by a unique porosity vs. vertical effective stress curve (e.g., Bowers (1995)). When sediment compressibility is high and permeability is low (overall coefficient of consolidation is low), rapid deposition of sediments may result in fluid being trapped in the sediment pores; this increases the pore fluid pressure and prevents normal compression of sediments (Bowers 1995; Osbourne et al. 1997). Traditional pressure prediction workflows use the measured porosity to estimate the vertical effective stress from the porosity vs. vertical effective stress curve; then, they calculate pore pressure as the difference between overburden and vertical effective stress.|","Document Type

Based on short-term creep, prediction of long-term creep can be a challenge especially at elevated stress levels, since only a small stress increase may change the creep behavior from stable to an unstable. The original power law model introduced by Sone and Zoback (2014) was applied to predict long-term creep based on short-term data fitting on data from a set of tests on Castlegate sandstone. The observation indicates that this model cannot predict long-term creep at high stress levels. The power law model was therefore modified by introducing a feedback mechanism based on the fiber bundle model (Hansen et al., 2015). This modified power law model is able to predict long-term creep also at moderate and higher stress levels. In fact, all three stages of creep can be captured by this modified model. Constitutive parameter analysis shows that it is feasible to determine reasonable constitutive parameters through short-term data fitting.
1. INTRODUCTION
Time-dependent deformation is a common phenomenon that may cause problems such as stuck pipe while drilling. On the other hand, it may be beneficial in operations such as plug and abandonment with shale as a permanent annular barrier (Williams et al., 2009). Being able to predict long-term creep based on short-term creep data is a wanted ability that may, for instance, help field engineers to evaluate the severity of borehole closure, or help to avoid unnecessary time consumption in laboratory tests. This is, however, a very challenging task.
Theoretically, a fully developed creep process contains three stages (see for instance Fj<U+00E6>r et al., 2008). They are transient, steady state and accelerating creep. With low and moderate stress level, most rock mechanical tests experience the transient creep first. Steady state creep is defined as increasing deformation with constant strain rate, and will eventually lead to failure. Most observations of creep in laboratory tests show increasing deformation with deaccelerating strain rate (Rutter, 1972, Gasc-Barbier et al., 2004, Rassouli and Zoback, 2016). The experiments mentioned in these references are triaxial tests with constant confining pressure. We assume the stress levels applied in these tests are low and moderate so no accelerating creep is triggered.|","Document Type

Currently re-fracture treatments are being used to sustain the level of oil production. The analysis of the performed treatments shows that re-fracturing is not as effective as the initial fracturing. The technology of oriented re-fracturing is being developed to increase the effectiveness of re-fracturing treatment. Creation of the hydraulic fracture which is pre-oriented has a number of advantages: a possibility of accessing poorly drained parts of the formation, decreasing the risk of water breakthrough etc. The main idea is to create a system of lateral horizontal boreholes situated in a vertical plane and oriented in the desired direction. The number of lateral boreholes and the space between them is determined based on geomechanical calculations. One industrial experiment was performed on the well to this date. The results are found to be optimistic.
1. INTRODUCTION
Many oil and gas reservoirs need to be hydraulically fractured for the economic development. Re-fracturing is a quite efficient way to control production decline after the first fracturing treatments. As discussed by He Liu et al., 2008, conventional techniques used for refracture treatments can lead to the following results:
refracture treatment tends to open an old fracture and only to regain the conductivity|fracture tends to be larger than the original fracturing treatment. As a result, it tends to increase water production in highly water flooded reservoirs|the treatment leads to reorientation of the fracture and it may contact undepleted reservoir areas
Re-fracturing is not effective in the first and second cases, or it can have a negative effect such as water intrusion. The technology of oriented hydraulic refracturing aimed at the increase of re-fracturing efficiency in the Western Ural oil fields is being developed. Creation of the hydraulic fracture which is pre-oriented allows to increase the treatment efficiency and to decrease the risk of negative consequences. The main idea of oriented hydraulic fracturing in a vertical well is to create a system of lateral horizontal boreholes situated in a vertical plane and oriented in a desired direction. The number of lateral boreholes and the space between them is determined on the base of geomechanical calculations. In order to realize this technology, the following studies are carried out: determination of the in-situ stress state; study of physical and mechanical properties of rocks; development of theoretical and practical basics of oriented hydraulic fracturing.|","Document Type

The analysis is based on the results of numerical three-dimensional simulation of the behavior of drilled shafts under the action of vertical compressive load. The results of the research allow to obtain the factor dependencies (regression equation) for calculating of bearing capacity and settlements of shafts. As independent variable factors in the equations were adopted: the ratio of the modulus of elasticity of the shaft to the modulus of deformation of intact rock, the ratio of the length of the drilled shaft to its diameter and RQD of the rock mass. The effect of the shaft - rock mass interface characteristics on the settlements of shafts were studied separately. Results of numerical simulation studies were compared with the results of in-situ tests of shafts.
1. INTRODUCTION
Socketed shafts are usually designed and constructed as foundations of high-rise buildings and bridge structures, when layers of loose soil overlie bedrock. The behavior of socketed shaft both in rock and in soil has a lot in common. However, the structure of a rock mass and their highly variable mechanical characteristics considerably complicate the calculation of bearing capacity and settlement of socketed shafts.
In soils, the load corresponding to the bearing capacity of shaft (Qp), is calculated by simple summation of the shear resistance force along its side surface and the resistance force of the base of the shaft (Qs and Qb). In the case of rocks, different researches show that this approach is possible only, if the failure of the sidewall interface (shaft – rock) is plastic and a load (Qb), transmitted to the base of the shaft, can be determined (NCHRP Synthesis 360).
Especially it should be emphasized the influence of the sidewall interface on the interaction of the shaft with surface of the rock. Variability in the properties of the interface and the character of its failure can have a considerable impact on the bearing capacity and the settlement of the shaft.|","Document Type

Upscaling from laboratory conditions to field conditions is not trivial, however. The finite size of the hollow cylinder and the downscaled hole diameter have impacts on the stress level and the borehole strength that have to be accounted for. Furthermore, the downscaled hole size also requires scaling of the loading rates in order to properly match pore pressure distribution and stress distribution. It is not possible for a hollow cylinder test to fully reproduce field conditions with respect to stress path, and in most cases not the stress geometry either. An additional complication is that borehole failure is not unambiguously defined in the field nor even in the laboratory test. These complications imply that upscaling of results from the HC test requires a relevant theoretical model, or at least careful design of the test. Nevertheless, the test is valuable for calibration of borehole stability models under specific conditions.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hollow cylinder (HC) tests are often used for studies related to borehole stability problems. The hollow cylinders are considered to represent the rock around a borehole, and the HC tests are expected to reproduce the processes involved when a borehole fails.
The benefit of using a hollow cylinder test as compared to uniaxial or triaxial tests combined with modelling, which is usually the alternative, is that the stress distribution around the hole of a hollow cylinder is similar to that around a borehole. This stress distribution implies a coupling between deformation and stress, unlike the situation in uniaxial/triaxial tests, and plasticity effects are therefore implicitly accounted for in the hollow cylinder test.
In other respects, the resemblance between an HC test and real downhole conditions is limited. The hole size is down-scaled in an HC test, and the rock volume involved is much smaller. Stress geometry, magnitude of stress and pore pressure, and temperature may be different from in situ conditions, as well as loading rate and stress history. It is therefore a number of parameters that have to be considered in order to establish a quantitative link between lab and field conditions for HC tests.|","Document Type

In order to research the influence of duration on the seismic behavior of high concrete gravity dam, in this study, a 185 m gravity dam model experiment based on similarity theory is carried out on a shaking table which type is Dys-600-5-05. The inputting seismic peak ground acceleration is kept as 5.32 g, and the earthquake periods are 0.48 s, 1.44 s, 3.20 s, 6.4 s, 9.6 s, respectively. Test results show that: when the seismic duration is less than 1.44 s, the dam body has no obvious crack, and there is no change in the whole frequency. After the time of 3.2 s, crack appears at the bending position above the dam toe of downstream face, and the crack extends to the bottom of the dam and eventually develops to be a penetrating crack at the time of 9.6 s. This study suggests that the dam will not be damaged when suffered a short duration of strong earthquake even if the peak acceleration is very large. With the duration increasing of strong earthquake, the cumulative damage of gravity dam is intensified, and the frequency of dam will significantly decreased.

The objective of this study was to quantify and understand the meco-scale structure change on the Karamay oil sand samples subjected to shear dilation. Three popular laboratory methods in investigation of microstructure: mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), computer topography (CT) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), were conducted in order to disclose the change in pore structure of oil sand cores before and after mechanics experiments. The CT image shows the existing of oil sand shear bands. SEM reveals that a large number of micro-cracks are generated in the samples, and the smaller confining pressure during shear applied, the more obvious the shear band becomes. The result derived from MIP shows different pore size distribution after shear-- the proportion of micropores decreases, and total porosity increases. Meanwhile, acquisition method of several mesostructural parameters obtained by three techniques are put forward. Finally, based on the meso-scale structure change in oil sand specimen after triaxial shear test, the oil sand reservoirs performance under water injection is interpreted and evaluated.
1. INTRODUCTION
Water injection applied to shorten preheating time of SAGD, achieved great success in Alberta, Canada and Xinjiang, China, is an efficient method in ultra-heavy oil recovery. It was discovered that a dilated zone in the neighboring region of the SAGD well pair could be created under water injection (Collin, 2002; Yuan, 2011a). Several research works and technical discussions (Dusseault, 1977; Samieh, 1995; Li, 2005; Yuan 2011b; Lin, 2015) concerned on dilation mechanism have revealed that the effect of water injection largely dependent on the extent of shear-induced dilation of oil sand under given stress state. In fact, shear dilation is the macro performance of internal oil sand particles extrusion and sliding due to external forces (Wong, 1999). Therefore, the effect of shear-induced dilation can be partly evaluated by the mesostructure change of the oil sand before and after triaxial compression tests.|","Document Type

MoFrac implements aspects of a unique geostatistical and rules-based methodology for DFN generation. Non-planar fractures are generated through a conditional simulation process that propagates deterministic fracture traces in three dimensions. Stochastic fractures are generated based on conditioning to statistics derived from field-mapped fracture traces and orientation parameters. Data mapped from the Aspo TAS08 tunnel close to Oskarshamn, Sweden were used for this validation study. The generated DFN model was analyzed for fracture orientation, size, intensity, and location. The modeling results demonstrate that MoFrac generates representative DFNs with a realistic appearance that conform to mapped fracture traces and statistics derived from the input data. MoFrac DFNs are suitable for integration into a variety of numerical models.
1. INTRODUCTION
The dynamics of a rock mass are related to the occurrence of natural discontinuities which occur on different scales, with variable intensities, shapes, and distributions through space (Lei et al., 2017). Fracture truncation, branching, clustering and spacing, among other measurable attributes, define the geometry of a fracture network. Computational models that represent the geometry of fracture networks contribute to the understanding of the strength and deformation behavior of rock masses, rock fragmentation, slope stability, groundwater flow, and mass transport. A discrete fracture network (DFN) model represents the geometric arrangement and characteristics of fractures within a volume of rock.
Several means of fracture network generation are described in the literature. Placement methods are computationally efficient because fractures are modeled as simple planar shapes arranged within a domain (Long et al., 1985), but the realism and accuracy of resulting DFN models are often limited. Mechanical propagation methods can produce realistic DFNs by simulating the creation of fractures driven by complex geomechanical conditions. These models are generally limited to fracture propagation in two dimensions and are computationally intensive (Lei et al., 2014). Geometrical propagation methods (Srivastava, 2002) are employed by MoFrac and provide much of the realism of mechanical propagation methods, while remaining computationally efficient.|","Document Type

Grenoble Alpes| Bolton, C., Pennsylvania State University| Zheng, L., Tsinghua University, Pennsylvania State University| Johnson, P. A., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Marone, C., Pennsylvania State University","|ABSTRACT: It is now widely recognized that earthquake faults exhibit a variety of slip behaviors ranging from near instantaneous and devastating rupture to slow slip events that last weeks to months. Simulating these events in the laboratory, in the form of stick-slip shear experiments, provides an opportunity to probe fault slip in a well-controlled environment usually unavailable in nature. We report on a suite of laboratory earthquakes, consisting of stick-slip cycles that are probed using a dense array of P-polarized piezoelectric transducers (PZT) to detect acoustic emissions (AE). The stick-slip experiments are performed on layers of glass beads, used as simulated fault gouge and which exhibit reproducible, earthquake-like dynamic rupture and frictional instability. The experiments were performed in a servo controlled biaxial testing apparatus in a double direct shear configuration. The AEs are treated as laboratory earthquake proxies and analyzed to gather information about their frequency, magnitude, energy content and location. We monitor these source characteristics and report on their behavior during periodic and aperiodic stick-slips cycles. We also report on AE during stable, aseismic shearing. We find that grain scale roughness could explain the presence of periodicity in unstable sliding behavior through observations of AE nucleation frequency, spectral content and AE energy.
1. INTRODUCTION
Tectonic faults exhibit a wide variety of failure modes, ranging from dynamic earthquake rupture to slow earthquakes and aseismic fault slip. The mode of failure is dictated by frictional properties of the faults, sliding rate, elastic coupling with the surrounding wall rock, and length of event occurrence in time (e.g., Scholz, 2002; Peng and Gomberg, 2010). Many studies have sought to understand and describe the underlying physical processes that produce these different failure modes and classes of earthquakes (e.g., Obara, 2002; Ide et al., 2007; Leeman et al., 2016). Precursory signatures of fault failure and earthquake slip have also been the subject of much interest. Laboratory and field examples of such signals include electromagnetic emissions, gas emissions, groundwater level changes, temperature changes, surface deformation, and changes in elastic wave speed (Hayakawa et al., 2000; Hartmann and Levy, 2005; Niu et al., 2008; Cicerone et al., 2009; Scuderi et al., 2016).|","Document Type

The fracture toughness of shale is essential to estimate the initiation and propagation of fractures. The Mode-I fracture toughness of the Longmaxi Formation shale, which is taken from the Silurian strata in China Sichuan Basin, is tested in this paper by using the cracked chevron notched Brazilian disc (CCNBD) method. The experimental conditions include air dried shale and water saturated shale. The results show that there is a good quadratic polynomial relationship between the fracture toughness and tensile strength of both the air dried shale and the water saturated shale. The tensile strength can be used to estimate the fracture toughness of shale. The average tensile strength of water saturated shale is 5.3325 MPa, decreased about 35.58% compared to the air dried shale (8.2783 MPa).
1. INTRODUCTION
As an emerging unconventional energy, shale gas has attracted much attention of many countries by its advantages of high energy intensity and little environmental pollution. The Longmaxi Formation of the Silurian strata in China Sichuan Basin (Figure 1) has a large exploration potential of shale gas (ARI, 2013). Shale gas, also called “Artificial Reservoir”, can only be extracted by means of mass artificial reservoir fracturing (Dong et al., 2012; Yan et la., 2016). At present, horizontal well volume fracturing has been the major method for producing shale gas. The initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures in horizontal sections are mainly referred as the Mode-I fracture (Chen et al., 2015). Fracture mechanics states that when the stress intensity factor on the crack tip exceeds the rock fracture toughness, the rock will break, or fracture (Kahraman and Altindag, 2004). The previous researches show that one of the primary causes for rock materials failure is the forward extension of micro-fractures, and the main reason behind the micro-fractures’ extension attributes to the tensile stress acting on the fractures (Ouchterlony, 1998; Fowell, 1995; Zhang, 2002; Golshani et al., 2006 and 2007). Mode-I fracture toughness could be measured by using several methods(Li et al., 1999; Cowie and Scholz, 1992), such as the three point bending round bars (CB), short rod (SR) and cracked chevron notched Brazilian disc (CCNBD).|","Document Type

C., Center for Mineral Technology (CETEM)","|ABSTRACT: The coastal city of Rio de Janeiro has historical buildings dating from the Portuguese imperial period to the beginning of last century. A remarkable feature of this cultural heritage was the use of porphyroblastic gneiss as stone masonry. As a consequence of city location, soluble salt crystallization is one of the most destructive processes leading to rock degradation. The aim of this manuscript was to evaluate the seismic response of gneiss submitted to laboratory controlled cycles of immersion in a saturated salt solution of sodium chloride and subsequent drying at 100±5 °C. Salt crystallization has produced an increase of initial porosity of samples from a mean value of 1.19% (initial condition) to 2.91% after 30 cycles. Regarding compressional wave velocities the average value in the fresh gneiss is around 4530 m/s while in the salt weathered gneiss the average value is 1453 m/s. The seismic anisotropy has also presented a huge increase from 1.06 to 1.79. It can be concluded that rock seems to become a medium progressively more heterogeneous and anisotropic. It requires a greater number of in situ non-destructive ultrasonic pulse tests in order to adequately characterize the gneiss degradation caused by natural cycles of salt crystallization. |1. INTRODUCTION |Salt weathering is a process that plays an important role on landscape evolution (Smith et al, 2000). Soluble salt growth inside of rock’s voids may generate internal stresses and microcrack propagation, which generally results in increase of porosity and rock strength reduction. This deleterious action of soluble salts may occur in all kind of rocks (Yu & Oguchi, 2010) and it has been observed at historic stone buildings and monuments (Moreno et al., 2006; Yavuz & Topal, 2007) all over the world and it is of relevance in conservation area. |The possible origins of salts that affect stone masonry are diverse and include atmospheric pollution, salt spray blown by the wind from sea, solutions from soil and carried into the stones by capillary action, incompatible building materials, among others (Doehne and Price, 2010).|","Document Type

Post-slide geologic evaluations of the sliding mode facilitated redesign of the slope excavation and temporary support. To expedite construction, the detailed redesign was performed in parallel with reconstruction efforts. The observational approach was carried out by a dedicated field engineering team to rapidly collect new geologic information, perform slope stability analyses, and implement field decisions to meet the excavation design intent. Recommendations by the engineer enabled the contractor to improve blasting designs, reduce blast damage, and improve the quality of rock support systems. With careful surveillance and instrumentation monitoring the revised excavations were completed without further incident.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Neelum Jhelum hydroelectric project (NJHEP) is located in Muzaffarabad district of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in northeastern Pakistan and is being developed by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) of Pakistan. When completed, the NJHEP will generate 968 MW of electricity.
The project utilizes a gross hydraulic head of approximately 430 m by diverting water from the Neelum River to the lower branch of the Jhelum River via a diversion dam, a 32-km-long headrace tunnel, and an underground powerhouse.
The project comprises the following three construction lots (Fig. 1):
Lot C1 includes the diversion dam, appurtenant headwork structures, and the initial segment of the headrace tunnels.|Lot C2 is the main site for headrace tunnel construction.|Lot C3 includes the powerhouse complex, surge shaft, penstocks, and the tailrace tunnel.
The Lot C1 headworks (Fig. 2) include a composite diversion dam consisting of a 60-m-high rockfill dam at the right abutment, a central concrete gravity dam with a spillway and a debris channel, and an intake structure forming the left abutment. The dam channels the water through the intake into a 300-m-long by 76-m-wide and 33-m-high sedimentation basin, then to a collecting canal, and from there into the headrace tunnel.|","Document Type

E., The University of Texas at Austin","|ABSTRACT: Understanding near-wellbore hydraulic fracture complexity is important for the design of hydraulic fracturing. This paper presents a fully coupled fluid flow and geomechanics model for predicting complex fracture propagation paths in the wellbore vicinity. The model is developed based on the coupled pore pressure extended finite-element method (XFEM). Fracture propagation, fracturing fluid flow, rock deformation, and pore fluid flow are coupled to model fracture behavior in the near-wellbore region. The influence of perforation angle and perforation length on near-wellbore fracture growth are investigated. Results show that a fracture initiated from a perforation misaligned with the direction perpendicular to the minimum field stress will finally reorient itself to that direction. But the fracture curvature resulting from fracture reorientation is highly related to the size and angle of the perforation. The results also demonstrate high dependence of fracture breakdown pressure on perforation size and location. The XFEM model proposed in this paper provides a unique tool to predict hydraulic fracture trajectory in the near-wellbore region. It can be used to aid design of various hydraulic fracturing related operations in the petroleum industry, such as fracturing stimulations, field injectivity tests, waterfloods, and produced water/cuttings re-injections.
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding the evolution of hydraulic fractures in the near-wellbore region is important for hydraulic fracturing design and injectivity test interpretation. The primary goal of hydraulic fracturing treatments is to provide a pathway, ideally with less tortuosity and high conductivity, to facilitate flow of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the wellbore. The main objective of field injectivity tests, e.g. mini-frac tests and diagnostic fracture injection tests, is to quantify some key reservoir parameters such as fracture closure pressure, permeability, and pore pressure. However, near-wellbore fracture complexity may have adverse impacts on the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing treatments and lead to difficulties in field test interpretations (Feng and Gray, 2017; Sepehri et al., 2015).|","Document Type

In this study, the transition between secondary and tertiary creep in salt is determined by a micro-macro model: The initiation of grain breakage is correlated with the acceleration of viscoplastic deformation rate and with the initiation of damage at the macroscopic scale. Salt stiffness decreases when macroscopic damage increases, which allows predicting the evolution of the damage zone around salt caverns used for geological storage. After implementing the phenomenological model into the Finite Element Method (FEM) program POROFIS, two thermo-mechanical coupled stress paths are simulated to analyze stress concentrations and viscous damage around a 650-m-deep cavern in axisymmetric conditions. Numerical results indicate that, despite the pressurization or depressurization-induced temperature variation, internal gas temperature always tends to approach the primary surrounding rock mass value. The viscous deformation induced by thermo-mechanical couplings significantly affects the original stress field at the cavern wall and induces high damage at the most concave sections of the cavern. Results reveal the significant influences of idle time, gas pressure range, and injection and withdrawal cycles on stress, strain and temperature distributions in the vicinity of the cavern. More analyses are needed to confirm the influence of thermo-mechanical cycles of pressurization and depressurization, and to design long-term cavern operations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Salt rock is a favorable hosting material for geological storage, including the storage of hydrogen, oil and gas, as well as Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). The design and performance assessment of such facilities require a fundamental understanding of the complex time-dependent behavior of salt, which depends on both salt properties and environmental factors (Carter and Hansen, 1983). Increasing deviatoric stress or decreasing confining pressure induces increasing steady-state strain rate in salt (Yang et al., 1999). The presence of brine at grain boundaries considerably influences the halite rheology and deformation (Urai et al., 1986). Temperature is also a crucial component for rock deformation around nuclear waste disposals (Senseny et al., 1992; Zheng et al., 2016) and CAES (Leuger et al., 2012).|","Document Type

Multiple factors during well construction and injection processes may have individual or combined influence on the micro-annuli formation. This paper presents a staged finite element modeling approach to simulate the well construction processes and injection cycle. Loads from the in-situ stress field, mud/slurry pressure, and periodic temperature changes are incorporated in the model. A “realistic” bottom-hole state of stress is generated in the model and microannuli generation is simulated by the tensile debonding of the cement-formation interface. The simulation results indicate the generation of micro-annuli is highly affected by the temperature difference between injection fluid and formation and the time span of the fluid injection cycle. Resulting debonding apertures in the models are in the order of 10<U+2212>5m which corresponds with previous studies. The modeling results of this study indictates once debonding occurs, the debonding aperture increases quickly and may exceed the ranges considered hazardeous.
1. INTRODUCTION
Gas migration (GM) or wellbore leakage is a significant problem that the oil and gas industry has encountered for decades in old well abandonment (Calvert and Smith, 1994), gas well production (Feng et al. 2016), and geologic CO2 sequestration (Nygaard et al. 2014). The leakage occurs as a result of wellbore integrity loss during drilling and injection processes during which the wellbore cement sheath may fail to isolate different zones. Wellbore failure and associated leakage pathways are shown in Fig. 1 (Celia et al. 2005). Except for cement cracking under extreme conditions, the development of micro-annuli is the main reason for gas migration in most scenarios.
Micro-annuli are defined as systematic and inter-connecting sets of fractures/tiny gaps between the cement-casing and the cement-rock interfaces, which provide possible pathways for gas migrating (Wang and Taleghani, 2014).|","Document Type

At the interface between different phases, the necessary velocity and stress continuity conditions are maintained, allowing interaction between particles from different materials when solving the momentum equation. The SPH approximation to the continuity equation is corrected in order to handle the density discontinuity at the interface between different materials. For the different types of layered rock, each rock type is presently assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, with perfect bonding at the interface. Failure of the rock or de-bonding of the layers occurs due to elasto-plastic damage model which includes the Drucker-Prager plasticity model and the Grady-Kipp damage model. We begin with a description of the theory governing this SPH framework. Following this, validation results are presented for the simulation of layered materials. Results using this SPH framework are compared to an analytical solution for geostatic stress, where good agreement is observed. Following this, the three point bending of a layered material as reported by Lee et al. (2015) is simulated. Simulation of the three-point bending experiment shows that inclined layers in the path of a propagating tensile fracture may have a significant influence in the ultimate fracture propagation direction.
1. INTRODUCTION
Prediction of hydraulic fracture propagation in a layered reservoir with natural discontinuities remains a big challenge to unconventional reservoir developments. The interaction of a Hydraulic fracture and natural discontinuities can alter the fracture path and lead to a complex fracture network which has significance consequences on the design of fracturing treatments and productivity. It is believed that the complexity of the resulting fracture network primarily depends on in-situ stresses, mechanical properties of the host rock, natural discontinuities, including layering and interfaces, and fluid properties and injection rate. Experimental observations show that in heterogeneous and anisotropic rock, hydraulic fractures may be become arrested, divert into or cross at contacts (or other discontinuities) between layers.|","Document Type

In several fields induced seismicity has been recorded during production. These seismic events are interpreted as induced by pore pressure changes in the reservoir rocks, resulting in stress changes on faults within and in close vicinity of the gas fields. Understanding the underlying processes of production-induced seismicity is crucial for the assessment and mitigation of seismic hazards during ongoing production in the onshore gas fields. In this study, we use a numerical geomechanical model in FLAC3D to analyze the relation between changes in reservoir pore pressures and fault stress changes. We address the effects of fault strength, reservoir and fault geometry and the presence of a viscoelastic caprock on the timing of fault reactivation, the nucleation of seismic events and the main characteristics of the fault rupture process. Results of our models show that the presence of viscoelastic caprock can strongly influence the timing and extent of fault reactivation and rupture. Faults with offset are generally reactivated at an early stage of reservoir depletion and involve relatively small slip displacements, stress drops and rupture lengths. The presence of a viscoelastic caprock even further promotes fault slip and nucleation of a seismic events at an early stage of depletion. Faults without offset are reactivated during later stages of depletion and involve larger slip displacements, stress drops and more extensive slip lengths than in case of early reactivation.

In The Netherlands gas is produced from over 150 onshore gas fields. In several of these onshore fields seismicity during production has been recorded by the regional seismic monitoring network installed by the Dutch seismological survey. Figure 1 shows the location of the onshore gas fields in the northern part of the Netherlands and related seismic activity. To date, no seismicity has been recorded in the gas fields in the southern part of The Netherlands. Magnitudes of seismic events are generally below Ml 3.0, though in a limited number of fields magnitudes up to and above Ml 3.0 have been recorded.

This paper focuses on the horizontal stress and pore pressure coupling effects on a fault stability study during cushion gas injection in a gas storage field in the Netherlands. To do so, initial field stresses were estimated using field data. Thereafter the poroelasticity theory and diffusion equation were implemented to estimate the injection-induced stresses at different time-steps caused by pore pressure changes. In this paper, the sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the influences of injection time and fault distance on the induced instabilities. The results of this study showed relatively good agreements of injection-induced stresses obtained from the analytical method with corresponding values from complex finite element simulations. Moreover, the results indicated that the injection point could be located closer to the central fault.
1. INTRODUCTION
Pore pressure and temperature variation in a reservoir and its vicinity occur during gas injection or withdrawal which could cause sudden slip on the pre-existing faults. Coupling between pore pressure and stress is one of the factors causing deformation and changes in the total stress field in the reservoir and its surroundings. Changing pore pressure directly influences the effective stresses as coupling effects mainly depend on the elastic and diffusion properties of the formation rocks as well as on geometrical characteristics such as positions and/or distances from wells. Rock properties can be simplified via elastic or constant permeability assumptions based on rock structure or compositions (Josh et al., 2012). However, coupling effects are still tedious to study due to the complexities existing in operational regimes and geometrical configurations. However, they are essential for geo-mechanical predictions related to caprock integrity, well bore stability, subsidence, fault reactivation and micro seismicity hazards (Ruistuen, Teufel, & Rhett, 1999). Terzaghi (1943) described the coupling effects via poroelastic theory for the first time; he noted that total stress is equal to effective stress plus pore pressure; and this theory has been the basic concept of rock engineering for many years.|","Document Type

J., National Central University| Tien, Y. M., National Central University","|ABSTRACT: This study presents a novel equation for determination of geometrical representative elementary volume (REV). Discrete fracture network (DFN) generated by FracMan was adapted to create rock mass models. Systematic random sampling process was performed to take specimen by firstly dividing the entire rock mass model into cubes. The fracture intensity (P32) of each specimen was measured. A series of parametric studies including dip angle, dip direction, Fisher constant K, size of rock mass model, shape of rock mass model, specimen volume, fracture diameter, and P32 were investigated. The results indicate that only specimen volume, fracture dimeter, and P32 affected the COV (Coefficient of variance) of P32. Based on the results of parametric studies, a novel equation to quantify the COV of P32 in terms of specimen volume, fracture diameter and P32 was established.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fractured rock mass is large volume of rock which contains discontinuities. In general, the term of “discontinuity” includes fractures, fissures, joints, faults, and bedding planes. For engineering practice, estimating rock mass behavior is one of the most challenging aspects in rock engineering design. When predicting the behavior of fractured rock mass, there are significant sample size effects or scale dependency. One valuable method to quantify the scale dependency is by utilizing the idea of representative elementary volume (REV) of a rock mass. The REV size corresponds to the minimum sample size beyond which the variation of properties of the particular rock mass can be satisfactory. When the sample size is greater than or equal to the REV size, the mechanical or engineering properties obtained from experiments or numerical simulations can represent the overall rock mass. In this way, determining the REV size is fundamentally critical issue in experimental design and analysis of rock mass.
Many researchers have established the dimensional of REV. Some researchers proposed the size of REV in term of length (Oda, 1985 and 1988; Wei, 1995; Schultz, 1996; Lama and Vutukuri, 1978; Lu et al., 2005 and Zhang and Xu, 2008; Pang 1998; Zhu 2003). In the other hand, Gutierrez and Dong, 2015 proposed the size of REV in term of area. By collecting field data sets, the REV is a function of radius of fracture area and the area exposure area in the field.|","Document Type

Nicolas, The University of Texas at Austin","|ABSTRACT: Up to 2015, about 5 million metric tons of CO2 have been injected into the Lower Tuscaloosa sandstone at Cranfield field, Mississippi. Pressure monitoring at one injection well shows that the bottom-hole pressure did not increase with the imposed injection rates as expected. Above the injection zone, pressure gauges measured a change of pore pressure of approximately 0.1 MPa in the absence of leaks. These two unexpected responses during the injection suggest potential geomechanical events induced by CO2 injection. We conducted triaxial tests in Tuscaloosa sandstone rock samples with CO2-acidified brine in order to understand chemo-poromechanical processes that may have contributed to these unexpected responses. Experimental results include measurements of permeability, relative permeabilities, quasi-static and dynamic elastic moduli, Biot coefficient, and chemically-induced creep at in-situ reservoir stresses. Results show a marked anisotropy in transport properties originated from features up to the scale of a few millimeters. Rock samples exhibited significant plastic strains upon loading and yield stress consistent with current burial depth. Creep rate increases more than one order of magnitude after CO2 injection. Chemically-induced creep deformation seems insufficient to cause significant reservoir compaction but may have contributed to horizontal stress relaxation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Carbon dioxide (CO2) geological storage can help reduce CO2 emissions by disposal into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and deep saline aquifers. However, injecting large amounts of CO2 at high injection rates may upset the geomechanical equilibrium of the host formation. CO2 has been injected for CO2 enhanced oil recovery (4.5 million metric tons of CO2) and geological storage (0.5 million metric tons of CO2 in the water leg) at Cranfield site in Mississippi (Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership - www.secarbon.org). CO2 injection and storage in the water leg used one injection well (CFU31F-1) and two monitoring wells (CFU31F-2 and CFU31F-3) (Lu et al., 2012a; Butsch et al., 2013; Hovorka et al. 2013).|","Document Type

Pristine and CO2-alterd rocks from the Crystal Geyser (Major et al. 2014) define the evolution of Fe-coating (hematite) into altered tribological films (goethite) surrounding the grains with different strength and stability properties. We use this transformed microstructural form to examine the ensemble strength and structural stability. We use a 2-D Distinct Element Model (DEM) to simulate fault gouge materials under slip events. The mechanical response of grain-grain contacts is represented by a linear-elastic contact model with rotational resistance and a slip-weakening friction law. Goethite and hematite coating configurations are represented using tiny particles surrounding quartz analog particles with different contact properties. Numerical shear experiments are performed on simulated fault gouge with unaltered (hematite coating) and altered (goethite coating) configurations. CO2 altered gouge shows lower friction coefficient (~0.4) than unaltered gouge (~0.65). However, the weakening effect of the goethite coating is not enhanced by increasing relative coating concentration. Results of end-member (unaltered and altered gouge materials) behaviors show that the goethite film may serve as the main mechanism of weakening and creep behavior in these CO2 altered faults.
1. INTRODUCTION
Shear strength of natural faults is crucial in determine slip of faults. Studies show that natural faults tend to slip at much lower resolved shear stress than laboratory inferred stresses [Engelder et al., 1975; Dieterich, 1979; Marone et al., 1990]. This weakening of natural faults can be related to mechanical effects of low effective stress - increase in pore pressure [Rice, 1992; Faulkner and Rutter, 2001], and chemical alteration on the mineralogy of the reservoir and the corresponding fault zone [Escartin et al., 2008]. For the former causality, it has been suggested that the elevation of pore pressure by anthropogenic injection activities may serve as one of the main causalities of induced seismicity [McGarr et al., 2002; Ellsworth, 2013; Walsh and Zoback, 2015]. Injection of supercritical CO2 into either brine aquifers or depleted oil reservoirs for sequestration may disturb the local stress field by elevating pore pressure, reactivating pre-existing faults, thus inducing potential seismicity [Benson and Cole, 2008]. Despite the mechanical weakening effects on faults, the chemical reactive fluid may also disturb local chemical equilibrium [Park and Fan, 2004; Altman et al., 2014], and alter the mineralogy. This may change the mechanical properties of affected zones by potentially introducing minerals with low frictional strength, thus weakening the faults [Wang and Elsworth, 2017]. The injected CO2 or brine may also migrate through highly permeable formations to expand the affected zones [Shao et al., 2010; Bakker et al., 2016]. These affected zones, possibly weakened by the combination of mechanical and chemical effects, may initiate slip events or even nucleate large earthquakes [Chou et al., 2012].|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Rock Mechanical parameters are critical in alleviating the risks associated with the drilling and maximizing the reservoir productivity. These parameters are used in the optimization of the well placement, well bore instability, completion design, draw-down limits to avoid sanding, hydraulic fracturing, and many more. The accurate estimation of these parameters is very essential for the development and production phases of hydrocarbon recovery. Incorrect estimation of rock mechanical parameters may wrongly lead to heavy investment decisions and inappropriate field development plans (Abdulraheem et al., 2009).

Two types of well trajectory have been discussed according to the whole trajectory and the correction trajectory. The sensitivity analysis of wellbore stability versus inclination angle and azimuth angle is conducted. The optimization model takes drilling depth as objective function and takes wellbore stability, dogleg severity as constraints. A new heuristic algorithm named differential search algorithm (DS) has been applied to optimize well trajectory combined with penalty function. At last, case study is presented and it demonstrates that the proposed optimization model can obtain a trajectory with minimum drilling depth under the constraints of wellbore stability and dogleg severity. It also indicates that DS has an excellent performance with high accuracy and stability for 3D well trajectory optimization.
1. INTRODUCTION
Cluster horizontal wells have been significantly applied in high-efficient development of shale gas field in China. Well trajectory optimization by minimizing the drilling depth is an effective way to reduce the drilling cost. The well trajectory optimization in shale gas field are faced with wellbore instability and potentially high dogleg severity. Thus, how to optimize well trajectory by integrating wellbore instability and dogleg severity is significant in horizontal shale gas well design.
Conventionally, well trajectory design is based on various calculation models (McMillian, 1981; Liu, 2001; Sawaryn, 2005; Han, 2007; Sawaryn, 2007). When some trajectory parameters are given, others can be calculated. However, to obtain an optimum trajectory, it always adopts trial-and-error approach and the process is time consuming, inefficient and difficult to ensure the optimal well trajectory. The optimization theory provides an efficient method for optimal design as the essence of well trajectory optimization is nonlinear constrained optimization (CO) problem. Helmy (Helmy, 1998) firstly established an optimization model for well trajectory design. Suryanarayana and Khaled have also studied this problem and sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT) has been applied to optimize well trajectory (Suryanarayana, 1998; Khaled et al., 1999). Aim at 3D well trajectory, Shokir established a new optimization model and the casing location has been taken into account. In addition, genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to optimize the 3D horizontal well trajectory (Shokir et al., 2004). Recently, Amin presents a continuous particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) for optimizing well trajectory (Amin, 2014). From the existing studies, we can find that the existing optimization model has not considered wellbore instability. Moreover, the trajectory optimization model may be difference in the whole trajectory design and the correction trajectory design, therefore, it is better to establish the optimization model respectively. Besides, the performances of optimization algorithms applying to well trajectory design are also needed to improve.|","Document Type

G., Monash University| Perera, M. S. A., The University of Melbourne| Wu, B., CSIRO Energy Flagship","|ABSTRACT: The growing demand and depletion of deep-earth mineral resources has increased the potential of considering mineral recovery in low-grade ore-bodies. In-situ leaching is an effective method of recovering resources such as uranium, and copper from low-grade ore by injecting a leaching solution to the deposit to dissolve minerals. Most common sedimentary ore-deposits and oilfields, however, needs a well-developed fracture network for enhanced recovery. Fracturing the ore-deposit for enhanced recovery requires sound knowledge of strength properties of sedimentary deposits. This study presents experimental results of mechanical properties of sandstone saturated in water, oil, and NaCl brines to represent strength characteristics of sandstone oilfields and saline, mineral-bearing sandstone formations. Unconfined compressive strength tests were conducted on sandstone samples and the stress-strain characteristics were captured through a non-contact digital image correlation system. Acoustic velocities and acoustic energy release of samples during failure were measured using a PCI-2 based AE system. Compared to water saturated samples, brine saturated ones showed further strength deterioration at lower brine concentrations and this influence diminished with increasing salinity. A significant strength retention in sandstone saturated in oil was observed compared to water and brine saturated samples. The acoustic velocities measured can be correlated with strength variation pattern of tested specimens.
1. INTRODUCTION
With the depletion of high-grade ore deposits and the environmental concerns arising with conventional mining methods, in-situ leaching (ISL) of minerals has emerged as a new technology making mining low-grade ore deposits more economical (Sinclair and Thompson, 2015). ISL involves drilling holes into the ore deposit followed by pumping a leaching solution into an ore body, dissolving the metals in the leach solution. The solution is then pumped to the surface and processed to recover the dissolved minerals. At present, ISL is limited to highly permeable ore bodies and fracturing technologies may be used to improve the performance of ISL by creating open pathways in the deposit for leaching solution to penetrate. However, fracturing of ore deposits, require a sound knowledge of strength properties of the target rock to minimize the nucleation and propagation of unwanted cracks which could lead to groundwater contamination in some cases (De Silva et al., 2016). Most sedimentary oilfields and ore deposits are usually are in saturated conditions and the strength variation in the rock under different saturation conditions is an important aspect that must be investigated before any field application of ISL in a water sensitive areas.|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Theory of rock fracture mechanics has been applied to solve many rock engineering problems such as rock drilling, rock excavation, rock blasting and hydraulic fracturing. It is well known that rock materials contains many pre-existing microcracks which may cause complex fracturing processes depending on environmental conditions. When a pre-existing crack is subjected to an externally applied loading, stresses concentrate around the crack tip and accelerates the crack growth., to understand the stresses level around crack tip, the evaluation of stress intensity factor is of significant importance. Fracture toughness is a critical value of stress intensity factor which indicates the level of stress required for the pre-existing crack to propagate under a given crack arrangement. Three crack tip deformation modes are generally possible in fracture process, i.e. Mode I (crack opening), Mode II (crack sliding) and Mode III (crack tearing). In rock engineering problems, Mode I and Mode II or mixed mode I-II is very important and thus various researches have been conducted in the past [1-5] to evaluate the fracture toughness for these fracturing modes. However, according to the ISRM suggested methods, there is only one experimental method to determine Mode II fracture toughness while four methods have been already suggested for Mode I [6]. In addition, experimental studies about Mode II fracture toughness of rocks are mainly for the case of quasi-static loading condition, while many rock engineering applications including rock drilling and rock blasting are carried out under dynamic loading condition. Because rocks show strong loading rate/strain rate dependency [e.g., 4,7], understanding the Mode II dynamic fracture toughness is also of significant importance.|","Document Type

"448","2017-0319","Hydraulic Fracturing With Leakoff in a Dual Porosity Medium","Wang, J., Pennsylvania State University| Elsworth, D., Pennsylvania State University","|ABSTRACT: Hydraulic fracturing is a key method in the stimulation of shale gas reservoirs. Shale gas formations often contain natural fractures which are fluid-pressure sensitive and dilate in response to the inflation of the fracture, increasing fluid loss and slowing down and prematurely arresting fracture propagation. Models typically assume 1-D single-porosity/permeability leakoff perpendicular to the hydraulic fracture. However, the leakoff process in naturally fractured formation is considerably more complex. We present a hydraulic fracturing model based on the PKN-formalism which accommodates the leakoff into a dual porosity medium. Proppant transport is accommodated by introducing empirical constitutive equations to determine the proppant distribution during the hydraulic fracturing treatment assuming that only the major hydraulic fractures remain propped. The model is solved numerically and is validated against known asymptotic solutions. It is shown that the model is capable of providing a rapid estimation of the morphology of hydraulic fractures in naturally fractured formations and the corresponding proppant distribution. The simulation results illustrate that the leakoff into a dual porosity medium, where fracture permeability is a strong function of applied fluid pressure, results in a reduced length of the propagating fracture due to the fugitive fluid leakoff from the fracture into the surrounding formation and that this in turn results in a reduced maximum width during the treatment. This observation is important as this significantly influences the ability to infuse fracture-maintaining proppants into the accessed reservoir at desired large distances from the injection wellbore due to the earlier screen-out and may compromise the ultimate efficiency of the final hydraulic fracture in relation to gas recovery.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is performed by injecting highly pressurized fluid into subsurface to fracture the formation. Proppant is introduced later to keep the fractures open. Since the pioneering work of Khristianovic and Zheltov (1955), various models have been proposed to approximately define the development of fracture geometry, among which the PKN and GDK models are the most popular (Perkins and Kern, 1961; Nordgren, 1972; Khristianovic and Zheltov, 1955; Greetesma and de Klerk, 1969). Reviews of those models including their numerical solutions can be found in Adachi et al. (2007) and Rahman and Rahman (2010). Further studies have been devoted to understanding the regimes of propagation and near tip behavior (Garagash and Detournay, 1999; Detournay, 2004; Adachi and Peirce, 2005; Adachi and Peirce, 2008; Garagash, 2006) which are summarized by Detournay (2016).|","Document Type

In the second example the present method is utilized to simulate simultaneous fracturing from three perforating clusters in a horizontal well. Numerical results of these two tests agree well with the existing experimental results and numerical results.
1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, as the oil exploration and exploitation gradually turn to deep and ultra-deep layers, the porosity and permeability decrease while the in-situ stress and rock strength increase. Deviated wells, coupled with the reservoir stimulation technology have become the main way of the exploitation of this type of oil and gas resources. Plane fractures are usually generated after hydraulic fracturing in vertical wells, while for deviated wells, fractures are more complex. In general, the direction of deviated wellbore is not consistent with the maximum principal stress direction and also unconformity with the orientation of the fracture, so it is easy to form multiple fractures around the wellbore (Yew and Li, 1987, Yew et al., 1989, Hossain et al., 1999, Hossain et al., 2000). Thus, predicting the geometry of 3D (three-dimensional) fractures of deviated wells has always be a difficult problem in the field of hydraulic fracturing.|","Document Type

These alterations generate micro/macro fractures in the cement matrix. Such situation, known as Sustained Casing Pressure (SCP), may result in creating pathways for any undesired formation fluid flow through surface and/or other formation(s) behind the casing annulus. The cement exothermic heat development is one of the probable internal alteration to cause SCP evolution.
This study is an experimental work carried out to investigate the effect of additives on exothermic heat generation. The effect of commonly used cement additives such as friction reducer and fluid loss controller on cement’s exothermic setting reaction had been studied. The thermal alteration of the cement slurries had been witnessed for a period of 24 hours. The results pointed out that the additives noticeably elevated the heat generated during setting period.
Furthermore, the results were modelled using statistical approach to pioneer the future work for field applications where the cement stability problems related to temperature generation experienced. The obtained results might create an awareness on the prominence of consideration the effect of heat while designing the different compositions of well cement slurries.
INTRODUCTION
The main duty of the cementing operations in oil and gas wells is to provide zonal isolation to and from the wellbore during the lifetime of the wells. Moreover, its mechanical strength improves the geo-mechanical stability of the wellbore and its low permeability provides shield for casings against corrosive formation fluids. Oil, gas and geothermal wells require wellbore cements to perform zonal isolation for decades (Nelson and Guillot, 2006).
The zonal isolation delivered by wellbore cements intends to prevent fluid intrusion into wellbores. Sustained Casing Pressure (SCP), defined as the pressure accumulation behind casing, caused by trapped fluids in the casing-cement annulus. In more than 22,000 oil and gas wells at Gulf of Mexico, 11,000 casing strings experiencing SCP have been reported. Hereof, The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that in the Gulf of Mexico, 56% of the loss of well control are associated with cementing operations and SCP, directly caused by inadequate zonal isolation.

A., University of Tehran| Kadkhodaie, A., Curtin University of Technology| Rostami, A., Pars Oil and Gas Company","|ABSTRACT: Geomechanical modeling of a reservoir has a very important role in all parts of a field lifecycle. In this paper, we demonstrate a new method for modeling the distribution of elastic properties in the whole reservoir using the concept of geomechanical units (GMUs). In this study, a GMU is a cluster of Young’s, Bulk and shear modulus, Poisson’s Ratio and unconfined uniaxial strength. To establish these GMUs we used eight wells and the Post-stack seismic data in the field of interest. Dynamic elastic parameters were computed from logging data of mentioned wells. To convert these dynamic parameters to static values, empirical equations were determined in a neighboring field of Salman, in the interval of Kangan and Dalan formations. In the next step, Multi-resolution graph-based clustering was applied to these static elastic parameters to construct five distinct GMUs. For three-dimensional modeling of GMUs, the 3D acoustic impedance model of the field was made by genetic inversion and used as a secondary parameter of Co-kriging. The amounts of elastic parameters of each GMU at the location of well number six in the final 3D model are found to be in good agreement with the known values of this well.
1. INTRODUCTION
Geomechanics is a petroleum engineering sub-discipline developed to address the mechanical behavior of the reservoir and bounding rocks during exploration and production activities (Zoback, 2010; Aadnoy and Looyeh, 2011). In this regard, Three-dimensional modeling of geomechanical parameters plays a significant role in whole life of a reservoir. These models are used for seismic modeling, interpretation, hydraulic fracture design, assessing borehole stability and stress calculations in geological studies. Therefore, any improvement in one of these momentous applications could lead to better and more sufficient field development plans, at the same time save the considerable amount of money and operation time.
This study employs an efficient approach to construct a 3D reservoir geomechanical model based on the concept of Geomechanical Units (GMUs). A GMU is a single unit for design and modeling purposes. A GMU can be selected from logs, cores, or judgment (Dusseault, 2011). The advantages of GMU use in engineering studies have been discussed by a number of authors including Uwiera et al. (2011) and Nygaard (2010). In this work, a GMU is a set of rock mechanical properties, such as: Young’s modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and uniaxial compressive strength. These elastic parameters are clustered by using different clustering methods to establish the best GMU. The purpose of using this method is to determine the distribution of elastic parameters in whole parts of the field of study. The Kangan and Dalan formations are the reservoir layers in the field of study. These formations are consisted of carbonate and dolomite (Figure 1).|","Document Type

It is expected that seismicity and the seismic hazard can be reduced by decreasing the stress changes and compaction associated with the declining pore pressure in the reservoir rocks. However, injection-related induced seismicity has been observed in many settings. Hence, the question can be raised whether injection can have an adverse effect on the seismic hazard and can cause an unwanted increase in seismicity. We employed 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Finite Element Modelling to investigate four mechanisms that can lead to induced seismicity during nitrogen injection in a depleting gas reservoir: (1) pressure diffusion into faults, (2) stress path irreversibility, (3) thermal stresses and (4) differential pressure evolution and stress arching. We show that, depending on the particular setting, mechanisms 1 to 3 can lead to fault destabilization. Using fault slip displacement and total fault slip length as indicative estimates for the induced seismicity potential of faults, it is concluded that these mechanisms can increase the seismicity potential of the faults during injection. Mechanism 4 is shown to be of negligible importance in a typical setting.
1. INTRODUCTION
Pressure maintenance by injection of nitrogen into a reservoir is considered as one of the potential options to mitigate induced seismicity during gas production. As seismicity in producing gas reservoirs is a consequence of stress changes caused by the decline in pore pressures and ongoing (differential) compaction of the reservoir rocks (Bourne et al., 2015; Van Thienen-Visser and Breunese, 2015; Van Wees et al., 2014) it is expected that seismicity and the seismic hazard can be reduced by decreasing these stress changes and the compaction by maintaining the pore pressure in the reservoir rocks. In recent years, however, numerous field cases of injection-related induced seismicity have been published in literature (e.g. Elsworth et al., 2016; Keranen et al., 2014; Ellsworth, 2013). This raises the question whether pressure maintenance by nitrogen injection can have an adverse effect on the seismic hazard and can cause an unwanted increase in seismicity. Injection-induced seismicity has been observed during wastewater injection (e.g. Keranen et al., 2014), hydraulic stimulation of shale formations (e.g. Bao and Eaton, 2016), enhanced oil recovery (e.g. Raleigh et al., 1976), underground gas storage (e.g. Kraaijpoel et al., 2012), underground CO2 storage (Kaven et al., 2014), Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) (e.g. Kraft and Deichmann, 2014), and conventional geothermal systems (e.g. Allis, 1982). To date, published cases of induced seismicity related to nitrogen injection for reservoir pressure maintenance have not been described in literature. Based on the physical mechanisms that are typically associated with the previously mentioned injection-related induced seismicity, four mechanisms were selected for further investigation with Finite Element (FE) models.|","Document Type

A., Schlumberger Moscow Research","|ABSTRACT: In very low-permeability rocks, hydraulic fractures can be prone to tensile rock failure caused by rapid pressure drop. This failure mechanism is sensitive to the rate of pressure drop rather than the rate of production and typically occurs when wells are initially set on production. Wells put into production with a too-aggressive flowback schedule can produce a large amount of solids, with fragments sometimes in the order of centimeters. The associated formation damage can result in the complete collapse of well productivity. At the same time, nearby offset wells in the same formation, brought to production with gradual increase of drawdown, can avoid solids production and production decline. In this paper, we review a quick-look numerical model simulating tensile rock failure in the near-wellbore region sensitive to pressure drop rate. The study illustrates, that even in the absence of rock strength heterogeneity, there is a certain length scale of produced rock fragments dictated by the depth of maximum tensile stress from the rock face. This depth is sensitive to initial stress distribution, rock properties, and dynamics of pressure drop. The paper also presents the sensitivity study to provide a general ranking of how various parameters influence this failure mechanism.
1. INTRODUCTION
Sanding and proppant flowback caused by high flow rates in hydraulic fractures during production are well-known issues. They can be addressed by installing sand screens and gravel packs and, eventually, by limiting production and keeping it below the critical flow rate limit that maintains proppant pack stability. Recently, with the rise of multistage stimulation from horizontal wells, there is a growing number of developments in very low permeability rocks. In these rocks, hydraulic fractures can be prone to another mechanism of rock damage: tensile rock failure caused by rapid pressure drop. This failure mechanism is sensitive to the rate of pressure drop rather than the rate of production and typically occurs when wells are initially set on production. Therefore, this type of failure, as well as the related damage to well productivity, is avoidable with proper pressure management practices, such as reducing production pressure at a reasonably low rate (Suarez-Rivera et al., 2011). For example, field evidence from relatively soft and high-pore-pressure formations shows that, when some wells were put into production with an aggressive flowback schedule, the size of solids produced can be of the order of centimeters, and the associated formation damage can result in the complete collapse of well productivity. At the same time, nearby offset wells in the same formation and target depth, which were brought to production with gradual increase of drawdown, had no significant solids production and production decline (Jacobs, 2015).|","pressure drop rate,  flowback,  tight rocks, rock damage,  tensile failure"

In this paper, we evaluate the geomechanical responses of large-scale CO2 storage in the multilayer aquifer of the Kra Al-Maru Trend in Kuwait. The site was selected after screening the whole territory of Kuwait, identifying and ranking of candidate sites for geological CO2 storage. We simulated the CO2 injection and geomechanical responses during 40 years of injection with an injection rate of 11 million tonnes/year. Results of numerical simulations show that after 40 years of injection the extent of CO2 plume is within the radial range of 4 km from the injectors, while the pressure build-up is felt up to 55 km. The largest pressure build-up of 2.3 MPa and the associated poro-elastic stress changes in the reservoir-seal pair are located within the radial range of about 5 km from the injectors. CO2 injection can induce a maximum uplift at the ground surface of 11 cm. The present-day noncritical state of stress and the magnitudes of induced stress changes suggest a low risk for containment integrity. Future studies will be required with a dedicated well to obtain core and perform detailed site characterization.
1. INTRODUCTION
This paper considers the geomechanical aspects associated with large-scale CO2 injection and geological storage in the multilayer aquifer of the Kra Al-Maru Trend in Kuwait. The potential multilayer aquifer CO2 storage site was selected based on the results of a site selection study performed for the whole territory of Kuwait. Geomechanical characterization and assessment of the selected storage site were performed with existing data provided by the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC). No additional experimental or site investigations were performed in this study.
Assessment of geomechanical response to large-scale CO2 injection in saline aquifers is reported in the literature for different storage sites. Large-scale impact of CO2 storage is due to the large area of elevated pressures in the storage formation, which extends several tens to hundreds of kilometers from the injection zone. Examples are for instance the potential CO2 storage in the Illinois Basin (Birkholzer and Zhou, 2009), the Shenhua CCS project in China (Zhu et al., 2015) and the South West Hub Project in Australia (Zhang et al., 2015). Although the footprint of elevated pressures is large, the mechanical impact on overlying sealing formations can be low, posing a negligible threat to the integrity of containment (e.g. the Sleipner CO2 injection project in Norway; Rutqvist, 2012).|","Document Type

Q., China University of Petroleum","|ABSTRACT: The permeability of shale gas reservoir is very low. Hydraulic fracturing is needed to form an effective production capacity. However, creep properties of shale gas reservoir rocks have effects on the development of shale gas, for instance, artificial fracture flow conductivity is very sensitive to the creep deformation of the crack. In this work, we make numerical model of the creep behavior of shale gas reservoir and the constitutive relation is based on creep experiments in triaxial deformation apparatus under room temperature and room humidity conditions. Model result shows that after one year the creep deformation is around 9% of fracture width and it will enhance proppant embedment and fracture closure during production process. The capacity of fracture flow conductivity can strongly decrease based on the creep deformation of shale rock after a few decades. In conclusion, shale gas reservoir rock has creep deformation controlled by power-law function of the time. Creep behavior leads to the fracture closure and decrease of fracture flow conductivity in the reservoir.
1. INTRODUCTION
Creep is a phenomenon in which material deformation increases with time. It has an important effect on the long-term deformation, strength and seepage characteristics of materials. It widely plays important roles in mine, tunnel, nuclear waste storage and large-scale gas storage construction. The various types of rocks have different degrees of creep characteristics. Normally creep deformation studies are mostly for high creep performance of soft rock such as mudstone and salt rock. Zhou et al. (1985) and Deng et al. (1993) established rock triaxial creep experimental devices in the laboratory and the creep experiment was carried out on mudstone and salt rock. The creep empirical mode and constitutive equation were established to analyze the stress on casing and wellbore stability.
At present, shale gas has become one of China's important oil and gas replacement resources. Shale gas reservoirs are generally more brittle rock and the permeability is very low. The key to the success of fracturing is the formation of large-scale, mutual communication and stability of the fracture network. Sone and Zoback (2010) found that the shale gas reservoir has a certain creep. The existence of the artificial fractured network of shale gas reservoirs and its extremely sensitive to weak deformation make the study of shale gas reservoir creep become important. The shale gas reservoir after fracturing has the characteristics of long exploitation time, artificial network development and small crack opening, which make the ability of fracture conductivity to be very sensitive to weak creep deformation. Creep can cause cracks of shale gas reservoir to close and affect its flow conductivity. It has also an impact on gas well productivity and final recovery (Sone and Zoback, 2014; Li and Ghassemi, 2012; Rassouli and Zoback, 2015).|","Document Type

The model evaluates the influence of the geochemical reaction on the evolution of the permeability in fractured rocks by considering pressure solution in detail. Pressure solution that occurs at both grain contacts and contacting asperities within fractures was incorporated in the model. By using the developed THMC numerical model, long-term prediction of rock permeability was conducted by replicating the subsurface environment near the radioactive waste repository. As a result of the analyses, the permeability decrease by two orders of magnitude smaller than the initial value occurs due to pressure solution at contacting asperities within fractures in the EDZ area. In carrying out radioactive waste disposal, it is apparent that pressure solution within the fractures has significant impact on minimizing the increase of the permeability in EDZ area.
1. INTRODUCTION
While considering performance of high level radioactive geological disposal system, it is necessary to examine hydraulic properties of rocks near high level radioactive geological disposal facility in detail. In near field that includes the surrounding rocks, phenomena such as heat radiation from waste body, movement of groundwater within fractures, stress redistribution, chemical reaction of rock minerals and pore water interact with each other complicatedly. In this environment, these phenomena are needed to evaluate comprehensively for examining the change of rock hydraulic properties. Therefore, it is important to develop the numerical simulator that can describe the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes.
Mineral dissolution and precipitation due to geochemical reaction may have the influence on hydraulic property change of the rocks. It consists of free-face dissolution and precipitation at the pore spaces, and pressure dissolution at the grain contacts and the contacting asperities within rock fractures. Especially, it is apparent that pressure solution has non-negligible influence for hydraulic properties of fractured rock [1]. Existing THMC simulators may not consider pressure solution at the contacting asperities within fractured rocks in detail. In our previous study [2], a THMC simulator was developed and it considers pressure solution only at the grain contacts in the rock. Therefore, in this study, we improved the THMC numerical simulator by newly considering pressure dissolution (PS) at both the grain contacts and the contacting asperities within rock fractures so as to predict hydraulic properties change of rock in detail.|","Document Type

There are many types and forms of supporting systems available in the mining/tunneling industry. In the last decade, a new polymer-based surface support material, thin spray-on liner (TSL), has started to take place of conventional surface support materials. TSL is defined as generally cement, latex, polymer-based and also reactive or non-reactive, multi-component materials applied to the rock surface with a layer of few millimeter thickness. They have the advantages of low volume, rapid application and low operating cost. The majority of current TSLs are two-part polyurethane/polyuria or Portland cement based latex products that are mixed on site before spraying onto surfaces. They are now being considered for highly stressed, deep, rock bursting conditions as a reinforcement and retaining element together with bolts and screen. In this study, the creep behavior of a cement-based TSL was investigated. For this purpose, 7-day cured dogbone TSL specimens were tested under 23±2°C laboratory conditions. A range of dead weights (80, 60, 40, and 20 % of the tensile strength) were applied until the rupture of the specimens. As a result of this study, the time-dependent strain behavior of a TSL was presented for different constant load conditions. Moreover, a new equation was derived to estimate tensile failure time of the TSL for a given loading condition. If the tensile stress acting on the TSL is known, the effective permanent support time of the TSL can be estimated by the proposed relationship.
1. INTRODUCTION
The major aim of rock support systems is to establish a safe and stable working condition for excavations through the planned service life. Since the 1990’s, in order to increase the safety during screening and bolting in the mines and to decrease the exposure to this process, thin spray-on liner (TSL) support which has been adapted from isolation industry has become the focus of the mining industry due to its considerable operational benefits, with the potential to reduce mining costs.

S., Texas A&M University| Shen, X., Georgia Institute of Technology| Arson, C., Georgia Institute of Technology","|ABSTRACT: Triaxial compression tests of synthetic salt-rock are conducted to investigate microfracture development in a semibrittle polycrystalline aggregate. The salt-rock is produced from uniaxial consolidation of granular halite at 150 °C. Following consolidation, the sample is deformed by cyclic loading at room temperature and low confining pressure (Pc = 1 MPa). Load cycles are performed within the elastic regime, up to yielding, and after successive increments of steady ductile flow. At the tested conditions, the samples exhibit ductile behavior with slight work hardening. The microstructure at different stages of deformation indicates that grain-boundary cracking is the dominant brittle deformation mechanism. Microcracking is influenced by the loading configuration and the geometric relationships between neighboring grains. These microcracks display a preferred orientation parallel to the load axis. With cyclic loading, microcracks increase in density and form linked arrays parallel to the direction of loading. As the linked arrays lengthen, grain contacts are progressively opened, which eventually leads to loss of cohesion along surfaces parallel to the loading direction. The observations of crack-network development in salt-rock can improve our understanding of progressive damage and spalling at salt cavern walls.
1. INTRODUCTION
Salt-rock is a viable geomaterial for hydrocarbon storage and waste disposal, because of its favorable creep characteristics and ultra-low permeability for sealing. In the case of storing high-pressure natural gas for balancing seasonal supply, or for pressurized gas associated with wind energy storage, salt caverns are subjected to long-term cyclic loading such that cavern stability becomes a major concern (e.g., Brouard et al., 2012; Minkley et al., 2015). A common stability issue is spalling at salt cavern wall, which not only alters the cavern geometry but also can damage the hanging string and cause roof collapse. Salt block fall due to spalling has been reported in numerous salt caverns, for example the Kiel salt cavern of Germany (Baar, 1977) and the Big Hill cavern of USA (Munson et al., 2004).|","Document Type

Hence, the effects of number of segments in the ring were investigated among which the worst case has been selected for further investigation. Subsequently, the influence of Key-segment location has been considered in-depth. To construct the required models, the beam-spring concept has been employed. The required input data was obtained from Line-4, Tehran subway tunnels. Abaqus, a finite element program, was used to analyze the problem. This program has the capability of analyzing tunnel structures by considering the effect of two-dimensional rotational behavior of intersegmental joint condition. The results demonstrate that as the number of segments per ring increases, the corresponding maximum bending moment within the lining system decreases. Consequently, the related displacement due to the lining flexibility increases. Finally, it has been concluded that due to increase of the number of segments per ring, the importance of position dependency of the Key-segment within the lining system is significantly reduced.
1. INTRODUCTION
Shield tunneling has become a widely-used method, in particular, for urban and suburban tunnel construction due to its superior performance compared to conventional methods. The method attributes negligible effect on surrounding environment, fast and safe construction, and outstanding performance in earthquake resistance. (Nadimi et al. 2010 and 2011, Zhang et al. 2004). The arrangement and number of segments in Shield tunneling may differ based on the existing situation; however, the entire assembling process is generally the same (Chen and Mo 2006). The design of the precast segmental lining is based upon the proposed tunnel alignment and the expected geological and hydrogeological conditions at the tunnel level. The existence of joints in a tunnel ring will influence the behavior of the support system and the induced stress pattern in the linin. Actually, inter-segmental joints can be used for the force and lining behavior evaluation. The segmental joint will have a behavioral mode somewhere between a total fixation and a hinge (Majdi et al., 2010, Nadimi and Shahriar, 2013). The orientation of joints within each segmental ring may vary along the tunnel route depending on the tunnel boring machine steering alignment. Furthermore, the possible mode of the joint orientation is governed by the joint numbers. The combination of these two factors might influence the stresses induced in the tunnel lining. Accordingly, both cost and planning purpose might be affected (Hefny and Chua, 2006). Therefore, the main purpose of this research is to investigate the influence of joint numbers and their orientations on the tunnel lining behavior. However, the tunnel lining design is almost based on empirical and analytical methods like the “beam spring model” which was proposed to analyze the tunnel lining under the ground loads (Murakami and Koizumi 1978). This method has become the standard technique to design shield tunnel lining in Japan (JSCE 1996). In this study, the model was used for representing the segmental joints and surrounding ground as rotational springs and non-tension ground springs, respectively.|","Document Type

Due to the presence of cleats and natural fractures, the coal commonly features low mechanical strength, remarkable brittleness and heterogeneity, frequently resulting in borehole instability issues during drilling, completion and production. In this present work, we developed a hydro-mechanical model to predict the borehole breakout and assess the stability of wells drilled in coal seams. The deformation and damage of the coal and the pore fluid flow within the coal are treated in a fully coupled manner. The mechanical behavior of the coal is represented by using an elastoplastic model incorporating post-peak strain softening, which has been evidenced to be essential for faithfully predicting the shape and size of the damage zone. In addition, the permeability of the coal within the damage zone is related to the damage state of the coal through an empirical relation. An inertia-based stabilizing method is proposed and implemented to overcome the loss of numerical convergence due to the abrupt strain softening constitutive behavior. The model has been applied to simulate the borehole breakout evolution and analyze the stability of coalbed methane wells drilled in the Qinshui basin located in north China. The effects of the drilling mud density as well as the mud infiltration are demonstrated, and some implications for drilling stable wells in coal seams have been provided.
1. INTRODUCTION
Economic production of methane from coal seams has been actively pursued in China during the last two decades, encouraged by the great success of the coalbed methane (CBM) industry in the United States and also by the abundance of CBM resources in China. Various technologies have been developed for enhancing the CBM production, among which horizontal drilling is more and more frequently utilized to increase the effective drainage volume, especially for those low permeability CBM reservoirs. Despite many efforts, maintaining wellbore stability remains one of the major challenges during the well construction and subsequent production processes due to the weak character of coals. It has been reported that nearly 40% of the horizontal CBM wells drilled by a major operator in the Qinshui basin, which is located in north China, have encountered borehole instability related problems, causing remarkable loss in time and cost (Yang et al., 2014). Thus, it is desirable to understand the damage process and borehole stability characteristics of wells drilled in coal seams and to provide some insights for successful well planning.|","Document Type

A comparison between inelastic time-dependent deformation of shale samples with different mineralogies at high pressures demonstrates that carbonate-rich shales show creep-hardening behavior at higher levels of stress whereas clay rich shales appear to creep more at high pressures and show creep-softening behavior.
1. INTRODUCTION
Oil and gas production from very low permeability unconventional resources requires hydraulic fracturing. There is a wide range of variations in characteristics within the shale formations; some of the formations are relatively brittle and enabling hydraulic stimulation to enable production, while other shale formations deform ductily and may act as fracture and flow barriers [1, 2, 3]. Predicting the magnitudes of the least principal stress within sedimentary basins has significant practical value in the petroleum industry.
Mineral composition has a direct effect on viscoplastic deformation of shale rocks. Higher amounts of clay and organic matter makes the shale formations deform with time which would likely lead to the formations acting as fracture barriers in the reservoir. In addition, it is important to understand the degree of anisotropy in the rocks and its affect on hydraulic fracturing [4, 5, 6].
In this study, we conducted creep experiments under constant applied differential stress of 30 MPa, 40 MPa and 50 MPa on clay- or carbonate-rich shale samples collected from the Wolfcamp formation in the Permian basin formation in West Texas, USA. Using the results of these experiments, we calculated the creep parameters from a power-law model to study how mineral composition and sample structure change the deformation of samples at different stress levels in longterm. The results help us to better understand the timedependent response of shale formations with various properties at different stress states.|","Document Type

D., Stanford University| Andrew, M., Carl Zeiss Microscopy","|ABSTRACT: Characterizing the heterogeneous structure of shale rocks plays a critical role in understanding their gas storage, fluid transport, and geomechanical properties. In this study, multiple imaging scales are used to better view features involved in the geomechanical properties of shales. Imaging techniques are combined with routine analytical measurements (e.g., X-ray diffraction and mercury injection) to investigate multiscale heterogeneity of a carbonate-rich 2.54-cm core sample from the Eagle Ford shale of southern Texas. A stitched computed tomographic (<U+03BC>CT) image was collected using an X-ray microscope with a voxel dimension of 13.4 <U+03BC>m. Within this image, several regions representing different matrix densities and features such as fractures were selected and imaged using a non-destructive method called “interior tomography” with an improved resolution of 3.6 to 3.7 <U+03BC>m. After the interiors were imaged, 5-mm diameter cores were drilled from the regions corresponding to the interior tomography regions using fiducial marks on the exterior of the core as reference points. High-resolution <U+03BC>CT scans of 5-mm cores have voxel lengths of 4.5 to 5.1 <U+03BC>m whereas interior tomography images have voxel sizes of 1.1 <U+03BC>m. The 5-mm cores were similarly subsampled as 1-mm cores that are imaged as whole cores and an interior tomography. The resulting data collection allows the comparison of <U+03BC>CT data at different scales and core diameters as voxel dimensions alone are not sufficient for this task. For instance, the interior tomography for the 2.54-cm core has smaller voxel size (3.6 – 3.7 <U+03BC>m) compared to that generated by the 5-mm core scan (4.7 – 5.1 <U+03BC>m); however, small features in the 5-mm core scan are better resolved than in the 2.54-cm core interior scan. Image quality and ability to segment properly is affected by the different <U+03BC>CT settings and additional rock volumes that the X-rays penetrate. In addition, volumetric data generated by segmenting 3D reconstructions of <U+03BC>CT data are compared to independent mineral, organic matter, and porosity measurements. The interpretation of multiscale <U+03BC>CT images improves our understanding as to the porosity distribution and rock fabric in this shale sample. These two properties factor into the geomechanical behavior of carbonate-rich shales.
1. INTRODUCTION
The unconventional hydrocarbon plays from mudrocks or “shales” contribute about half of the overall gas and oil production in the United States; this proportion is expected to increase over the next twenty years [1, 2]. The development of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has made hydrocarbon production from these unconventional reservoirs possible technically as well as economically feasible for the oil and gas companies. In order to employ these techniques, characterization of the physical and fluid flow properties of shale reservoir rocks has become both a necessity and a complex problem [3, 4]|","Document Type

The sensor is made of two plastic optic fibers that are aligned side by side and glued together. The tips of these fibers are cut so that outward normal vectors of the cut surfaces are 90 degrees apart and at the same time each of them is at 45 degrees from fiber axes. As light is sent into the first fiber and reaches its tip, part of the light gets refracted and goes out of the fiber into the material ahead. The other part gets reflected, goes out of the first fiber through its side face and gets into the second fiber. This light reaches the cut surface of the second fiber from within and then part of it goes out into the material outside. The remaining light gets reflected and travels through the second fiber back to a photo sensor to be digitally recorded. The intensity of the recorded light is a function of differences between refractive indices of the plastic optic fiber and the material ahead of the fiber tip. Analysis of this intensity leads to understanding of if the fiber tip is in air or in water in geo-material, which is of great interest in geotechnical engineering projects.
1. INTRODUCTION
Use of optic fibers in geotechnical monitoring is twofold. In the first method, a long and continuous fiber is used to measure strain, temperature, etc. at arbitrary points on the fiber (for example, Hill et al 1978, Meltz et al 1989, Funnel et al 2015) laid out in a closed topology. In this method, grated fiber made of glass is generally used over a large area and collected data are post-processed to obtain final results. No light is transmitted between the fiber and an outside environment; namely in geomaterials. In the second method, on the other hand, an open-ended topology of optic fiber is used for data collection. Akutagawa et al (2014a, 2014b, 2015) have reported several examples in which plastic optic fibers are used as though they are lowest-resolution cameras. In this method, plastic optic fiber is used as a one-pixel camera to watch deformation of sand particles, passage of water in granular material, passage of air bubble, wetting process of dry sand and so on. Yoshikawa et al (2015) has also applied this method to dynamically monitor change in sea bed elevation during storm. Optic data transmitted from the front face of the fiber can be either recognized by naked eyes, or they can be recorded by photo sensors on a real-time basis. This paper introduces a new strategy to be added to a series of monitoring tools developed in the line of the second method, so that differentiation of a material in front of the fiber tip; namely, whether it be water or air, becomes far easier than before by uniquely cut fiber surfaces. Reflection and refraction of light play a key role in the proposed method. Several examples are described to show how this new sensor works and its future potentials are discussed from a viewpoint of applying this new technology in various geotechnical engineering projects.|","Document Type

W., Bureau of Ocean Energy Management","|ABSTRACT: This study provides an improved interpretation and delineation of pore pressure in the Chukchi shelf region. Between 1989-91, five exploration wells were drilled on the Chukchi shelf and an array of drilling performance and petrophysical data were acquired. Resistivity, conductivity, sonic travel time, sonic porosity, and drilling exponent data were used to evaluate formation pore pressure. Normal compaction trendlines were established using depth-dependent relationships then integrated with Eaton and adapted Eaton equations to estimate formation pressures. Four of the five wells were found to contain significant overpressure at onset depths ranging from 1098 to 2317 meters subsea. The overpressure is mainly associated with organic-carbon-rich source rocks that have experienced thermal exposures sufficient for hydrocarbon generation. The driving mechanism for the origin and maintenance of the overpressure appears to be linked to hydrocarbon generation at the wellsites and access to hydrocarbons migrating from the regional generation center beneath the Colville basin to the east.
1. INTRODUCTION
Pore pressures in many deep sedimentary formations often exceed hydrostatic pressures, a condition termed “overpressure”. If not properly balanced by drilling fluids, an overpressured formation may cause a well to flow to the surface. Overpressure thus forms a hazard to drilling operations if not anticipated in well planning.
The purpose of this study was to develop an improved interpretation and delineation of pore pressure in the frontier Chukchi shelf region. The Chukchi shelf is located offshore northwestern Alaska in water depths typically 50 meters (165 ft) or less. Five exploration wells were drilled on the Chukchi shelf during open water seasons from 1989-91 and an array of drilling performance and petrophysical data were acquired. In this study, resistivity, conductivity, sonic travel time, sonic porosity, and drilling exponent data are used to evaluate formation pore pressure. Normal compaction trendlines are established using depth-dependent relationships then integrated with Eaton and adapted Eaton equations to calculate formation pressure. Four of the five wells penetrated overpressure and hydrocarbon generation is suggested as the driving mechanism behind the origin and maintenance of formation overpressure in the Chukchi shelf region.|","Document Type

Y., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign| Vilarrasa, V., Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research","|ABSTRACT: In geologic CO2 storage, it is important to find a proper barrier material that will avoid or limit acidic fluid migration. Shales that are ductile and have high capillary entry pressure and low permeability can be considered as good candidates for the caprock. Faults may contain high percentage of clay and act as barriers for fluid flow in reservoirs. Experimental techniques have been developed to characterize the behavior of clay-rich materials at elevated pressures. Intact and remolded specimens of Opalinus clay – a Jurassic shale from Switzerland – are brought to the conditions of deep (> 1 km depth) geologic storage and fully saturated with in-situ brine. Poromechanical parameters and failure characteristics are measured in drained and undrained conventional triaxial compression experiments. CO2 breaktrough pressure and permeability of shale are assessed in oedometric tests on thin (12 mm) samples. Experimentally measured parameters are used in numerical simulations to assess fault stability and the shaly caprock integrity for the case of geologic carbon storage, where cooling is likely to occur around injection wells. It is found that clay-rich faults may induce microseismic events, but without leading to CO2 leakage.
1. INTRODUCTION
Safe long-term carbon dioxide (CO2) geologic storage largely depends on caprock integrity (IEAGHG, 2011). The caprock may be especially altered at the early stages of injection, when the maximum overpressure is reached (Vilarrasa et al., 2010). As CO2 is injected in the storage formation, it tends to advance through the top of it and below the caprock due to buoyancy (Hesse et al., 2008). Furthermore, the injected CO2 will reach the bottom of the well at a colder temperature than that of the storage formation (Paterson et al., 2008). As a result, a cold region is formed around the injection well, but the cooling front advances much behind than the CO2 plume interface (Vilarrasa and Rutqvist, 2017). Thus, the lower boundary of the caprock is in contact with CO2 saturated pore water or pore fluid that consists almost of pure CO2, which may be cold (Figure 1). These thermal and chemical interactions between the pore fluid and the caprock may change its material properties and affect stability.|","Document Type

A., TNO Applied Geosciences","|ABSTRACT: The understanding of geothermal fields requires coupling between heat flow through fractures and induced seismicity. In this context, we develop a semi-analytical approach for estimating (1) thermo-poro-elastic stresses in a fractured geothermal system, and (2) seismicity rates based on the model of Dieterich (1994). Cold water is injected at constant rate into a single fracture surrounded by hot impermeable layers. Heat flow is dominated by advection and conduction respectively inside and outside the fracture. Poro- and thermo-elastic stresses are estimated separately following the nucleus-of-strain concept; and for any potential fault around the single fracture the induced Coulomb stress rates are resolved. For this particular scenario, the thermal stresses are dominant. We show that thermal-stressing rates can induce an increase in the rate of seismicity of more than hundredfold at distance up to 200m from the single fracture. Our fast forward model is suitable for data assimilation, and by predicting the spatio-temporal evolution of the locations of increase/decrease of seismicity rate one might optimize geothermal systems while keeping seismicity at a relatively low magnitude.
1. INTRODUCTION
The sustainability of geothermal fields is based on a paradox. On one side fractures are targeted for heat-flow improvement, and on the other side these same fractures are avoided because of induced-seismicity risk. More specifically, slip along fractures can enhance the heat flow but can also lead to large seismic events. The grail is to take advantage of fracture conductivity while keeping seismicity at a relatively low magnitude avoiding risks of large earthquakes (Zang et al., 2013). Our present model contributes to a better understanding of this complex coupling between heat transfer, flow, fractures, and earthquakes.
Flow through a fractured geothermal system is often modelled with complex numerical approaches, taking into account the interaction between multiple fractures (Taron et al., 2009; Izadi and Elsworth, 2010; McClure and Horne, 2010). These models give detailed pictures of the Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical couplings, but the drawback of this time-consuming model is that processes and physical parameters cannot be updated via a data assimilation scheme.|","Document Type

To solve this problem, this paper presents a full-automatic recognition method of structural plane parameters in the obtained borehole image from borehole camera or imaging system. This method uses image gray, gradient values and projection method to distinguish the occurrence region of borehole structural planes, and then uses standard sine function matching method to search the structural plane in the region. Results show that this method can automatically identify the structural planes in the borehole image continuously and quickly, and obtain the corresponding structural parameters, such as the central positions, orientations and dip angles of structural planes in borehole images. It is stable and reliable, and greatly improves the working efficiency. This full-automatic recognition method can realize the automatic features picking of structural planes and the analysis of geometric parameters in borehole images after drilling engineering. This paper has provided an effective and reliable solution for the improvement of drilling information acquisition technique and borehole image signal processing technique.
1. INTRODUCTION
Knowledge of a rock body’s structural stability is often necessary in geotechnical, geological, oil extraction, and also geological disaster control projects. The reliability of a project can heavily depend on the structural planes found in rock bodies, such as joints, faults, weak planes, and bedding planes [1-3]. A digital panoramic borehole camera system can obtain the high-definition images of boreholes that offer an accurate representation of their structural planes characteristics. Therefore, the accurate recognition of structural planes and rapid extraction of their parameters are highly valuable for actual drilling engineering [4-6].
Present identification methods of structural planes in borehole images mostly rely heavily on human reading. Generally, the structures identification and parameter extraction process may involve computer-aided preprocessing or characteristic curve fitting. Through using human-assigned control points on the structural plane or other necessary parameters, the methods can obtain the sine curve’s parameters of structural planes in borehole images [7-9], which is a laborious and slow process that requires human intervention. And the obtained structural plane parameters are often vary depending on individual readers [10-12]. This kind of manual identification process can become a drain on time and human effort in engineering practice, particularly when the boreholes are deep or numerous. Thus, the full-automatic recognition of structural plane parameters in borehole images for actual drilling engineering becomes urgent and very valuable.|","Document Type

This study aids analysis of critical stress conditions for well integrity and initiation of damage in wellbore cement during operation of geothermal wells using a combination of analytical and discrete element models. The analytical models are used to determine wellbore stresses that are applied to 3D discrete element models of typical well sections. Wellbore models and boundary conditions are based on subsurface conditions encountered in well IDDP-1 of the Iceland Deep Drilling Project. Possibilities of using the discrete element models to test the behavior of well materials under realistic pressure and temperature conditions in this type of wells are explored. The workflow may be used to test novel well materials and designs at different depths.
1. INTRODUCTION
Maintaining long term wellbore integrity in high temperature environments is one of the key challenges for the commercial success of geothermal projects. Geothermal drilling environments are often hostile to well materials, especially in magmatic settings where properties of well casing and cements may rapidly change as a result of high temperatures and chemically active formation fluids. Prevention and mitigation of well integrity problems under these conditions is aided by detailed knowledge of critical conditions for wellbore failure and by analysis of special requirements for well materials. The integrity of wellbore cement is particularly important in high temperature geothermal wells as cement damage promotes migration of reactive fluids along and through the cement sheath, and reduces thermal isolation of the casing by the cement sheath. The resulting reduction in zonal isolation, enhanced casing corrosion, and elevated thermo-mechanical stresses may significantly reduce the lifetime of geothermal wells.|","Document Type

The advantage of CWFS over conventional shear strength failure criterions in describing the process of extensile fracturing (spalling) makes it ideal for modelling damage processes in hard rock pillars. The majority of numerical studies of pillars to date, however, have focused on the application of strain-softening material models; while these models may be suitable for capturing mine-scale behavior of pillar systems, they provide little insight into the mechanisms governing pillar stability. Recently, the concept of an S-shaped strength criterion was introduced which combined the CWFS strength model (at low confining stress) with the classical shear strength envelopes (at higher confining stress). Theoretically, such a model should better capture the brittle fracturing phenomenon along the ribs and the shear fracturing inside the pillar where confinement is high. In this study, the progressive S-shaped strength envelope has been implemented in FLAC3D using a bilinear strength model and has been demonstrated to exhibit some well-documented behavior seen in failing pillars. As a final step, a range of width/height ratios were tested and the results were compared against published field data, empirical strength envelopes, and previous modelling attempts presented in the literature.
1. INTRODUCTION
With underground mining extending to depths over 2 kms, it is essential to design stable pillars which can provide local as well as regional support [1]. Pillar design is based on two important parameters – strength and applied stress, both of which are difficult to estimate analytically. Numerical modelling offers a convenient alternative to estimate these quantities, and is often employed during the design phase of a project. The success of such modelling is governed by the selection of a proper constitutive model and associated input parameters.
In this paper, an attempt is made to develop a local constitutive relationship that can account for micromechanical damage processes while exhibiting emergent macroscopic failure behavior in rock pillars. The developed constitutive relationship, termed as the progressive S-shaped failure criterion in this study, is first tested for its ability to qualitatively capture observed rock damage processes using a pillar model in FLAC3D, followed by comparison against an empirical pillar strength database from literature.|","Document Type

The authors developed and performed a three-dimensional physical model experiment to understand these phenomena. In spite of having highly advanced computational techniques, researchers still heavily depend on physical model tests before constructing any underground excavation to understand the phenomenon’s like tunnel damage process, deformation pattern, subsidence and caving mechanism etc. A variety of distinct physical modelling techniques has already been developed and proposed by several researchers all over the world to study the ground response around the tunnel opening and monitoring the surface settlement. These techniques range from simple “base friction models” to highly advanced “manually controlled centrifuge models” that simulates the failure mechanism and distortion behavior of tunnel under variable engineering and geomechanical conditions. The present study shows a laboratory model conducted under the effect of gravity to study the deformational behavior, tunnel mechanical features, failure mode and ground settlement profile. The ground deformation was observed with the help of normal measuring tape attached on transparent acrylic wall and video recording of events. The outcome of these tests were then compared with empirical equations and well-established mathematical models.
1. INTRODUCTION
Due to the rapid increase in the infrastructure development, there is a terrible need to understanding the behaviour of geotechnical structures before the collapse and during the failure of underground excavations. Tunnelling has now become a common construction method for most of the design engineers all over the world as urban expansion surges and nonavailability of surficial land. Hence, it is very important to have a proper understanding of tunnel induced stresses, movements and their influences on neighbouring civil constructions (Meguid et al. 2008). In most of the cases, tunnels are built at shallow depth for comfortable access to the immediate vicinity to the existing infrastructure. So, in urban regions tunnels were often constructed in soft ground (Idinger et al. 2011). In spite of having significant advancement in tunnelling technology in past few decades, the soft ground has always possessed some inherent difficulties associated with it to create problems during tunnelling. To study these issues, researchers have proposed several empirical, numerical methods along with some physical models. All these tools have some advantages and some disadvantages. The empirical methods, based on data collected in the field, is used by various researchers to investigate the lining stress or surface settlement profile (Hoek and Brown 1980; Mair et al. 1993; Hoek and Diederichs 2006; Meguid et al. 2008; Ma et al. 2014).|","Physical model,  Shallow tunnel,  Soft ground,  Surface settlement profile,  Face stability"

Among the different numerical methods, researchers commonly use Discrete Element Method (DEM) to study the rock cutting process. DEM 2D models give good qualitative results. Unfortunately, the calculated cutting forces are not in agreement with the ones measured in laboratory by cutting tests. To be able to compare correctly cutting modeling and cutting laboratory tests, we decided to use the geometric feature of 2D numerical models where the sample and the PDC cutter have the same unit width of one meter and adapted it for the laboratory tests. For this purpose, we prepared rock samples in order to have the same width than the PDC cutter used. Using this method, we highlight the good quantitative correlation between laboratory slab tests and the results provided by the numerical models. Indeed, the evolution of cutting forces depending on the depth of cut is comparable to laboratory tests and they are quite similar in terms of magnitude.
1. INTRODUCTION
During this low prices period for oil and gas on the market and the uncertainty about the evolution of these prices, it is important for the oil and gas industry to optimize its whole process costs. One of the aspect to optimize is the drilling operation, which requires a better understanding of the destruction mechanism of rock. For this work, we decided to focus on the specific rock cutting mechanism involved by Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) drilling tools. We made this choice because these drilling tools are increasingly used due to the improvement of the mechanical properties of the PDC cutters.
Currently, two methods are essentially used to study the rock cutting mechanism: laboratory tests and numerical modeling. Researchers increasingly used numerical modeling, which allows having a more precise comprehension of the mechanism and requires less laboratory instrumentations. Among the different modeling methods, they often used Discrete Element Method (DEM) due to its capacity to take into account the granular aspect of the rock at a small scale and to represent the propagation of fractures into the rock materials.|","Document Type

These are on the one hand the allowable maximum and necessary minimum internal pressure to ensure a gastight and stable cavern over decades and on the other hand the limitation of the withdrawal and refill rates between these geomechanical limits.
During the withdrawal phases of the gas the temperature decreases which can lead to stress states in tensile regions at the cavern wall. Because the tensile strength of rock salt is relatively low compared to its compressive strength it is likely that tensile stresses lead to discrete fractures orthogonal to the direction of the tensile stresses. If fractures of this kind are created - whether vertical or horizontal - the gas will penetrate into the fracture at the relevant pressure and further extend the length of the fractures under certain circumstances.
There are currently research projects in work that can describe whether the fractures might propagate into the not by temperature changes influenced rock salt mass during repeated cyclic pressure changes.
Salt caverns cannot be entered but only explored by sonar measurements, with which it is not possible to detect tensile fractures at the cavern wall. Within this paper examples from mining configurations will be shown where temperature changes lead to tensile fractures in the surrounding rock salt. These fractures have been well mapped while the temperature development is well documented.
The paper deals with recalculations under consideration of different salt properties of the temperature distributions and the resulting stress state in the surrounding rock salt mass. The stress calculation results and the consequences for the dimensioning of natural gas caverns are going to be discussed and assessed. A special aspect within this topic is the cooling of the cavern surrounding rock salt mass after the leaching phase with relatively cool fresh water and the influence on the first operation period.|","Document Type

N., The University of Texas| Torres-Verdin, C., The University of Texas| Spikes, K. T., The University of Texas| Laubach, S. E., The University of Texas","|ABSTRACT: Layering-induced anisotropy of shale formations increases uncertainty in determining in-situ mechanical properties and stresses, thus increasing the risk associated with implementing advanced drilling and hydraulic stimulation in shales. We conduct simultaneous triaxial stress tests and ultrasonic wave propagation monitoring to quantify static and dynamic stiffness anisotropy in Mancos Shale. Two case studies evidence the impacts of (1) confining stress and (2) presence of pre-existing fractures, on dynamic-static transforms of Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios with increasing deviatoric stress. The first case shows that confining stress more heavily impacts dynamic mechanical properties than static. The effect is most prominent at high deviatoric stresses, where stress-induced damage increases the difference between dynamic and static Young’s moduli. The second case shows that samples with pre-existing fractures exhibit even higher differences between dynamic and static Young’s moduli than non-fractured (intact) and damaged rocks. Fractured samples exhibit ratios of Edyn/Est between 5:1 and 7:1, whereas intact samples generally remain near the 3:1 ratio. Pre- and post-test X-ray microtomography imaging confirm that bedding planes and pre-existing fractures act as planes of weakness, while sample layering causes mechanical stratigraphy, where changes in lithology may cause fractures to reorient. Results highlight the limitations of tangent linear elasticity moduli to explain complex deformational behavior in shales and the need for better models that address the strain-magnitude dependence of rock properties.
1. INTRODUCTION
Shale layering causes bed-parallel differences in rock properties, a component of mechanical stratigraphy (Laubach et al. 2009). Stratigraphic variations in mechanical properties are known to influence the growth of engineered fractures (Bosziak et al. 2014). A further element of bed-perpendicular anisotropy can be introduced by pre-existing fractures, which can impact rock stress-strain response (Bergbauer and Pollard 2004). Over geologic time, subsurface stresses may vary, which can cause natural fracturing. Chemical alteration (diagenesis) might stiffen natural fractures, therefore their orientations might not be aligned with current stresses or layering (Laubach et al. 2004). Consequently, the attributes and orientation of layering and diagenetically altered open fractures can impact rock mechanical behavior, engineered fracture growth, and rock failure under a range of loading paths. Layering and pre-existing fractures are suspected to influence the behavior of shales undergoing hydraulic fracture treatment (Suarez-Rivera et al. 2013, Gale et al. 2014).|","Document Type

This discrepancy is due to improving the conductivity of natural fractures in geothermal reservoirs is essentially different from traditional hydraulic fracturing in conventional oil and gas reservoirs. The effective conductivity aperture of natural fractures becomes an important parameter to characterize fracture conductivity in geothermal reservoirs, which is affected by initial fracture roughness, shear-induced dilation, thermoelasticity as well as chemistry of hot dry rocks. A coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical-chemistry model was developed to analyze the composition of the total hydraulic aperture and primary role in different fracture section. The result shows that thermal effect plays a major role in increasing the conductive aperture in the near borehole area, which is also an effective way to reduce the surface pumping pressure at the hydraulic fracturing site. However, relative to thermal induced aperture, shear dilation remains stable along the fracture and increases with the injection pressure. The effect of chemical dissolution/precipitation of short-term hydraulic fracturing on fracture aperture is too small to be negligible. Therefore, Long term high pressure injection is the best way to enhance the conductivity of several hundred meters of underground water circulation and heat exchange fracture network.
1. INTRODUCTION
Geothermal energy is renewable, clean and green energy that is generated by the continuous decay of isotopes and stored in the Earth. As of the end of 2015, there were 12.5 GW of potential capacity additions in 82 countries spread across 700 to 750 identifiable projects (Barbier 2002; Matek 2016). There is about 42.7<U+00D7>106EJ geothermal resource over a depth of 3km and 80% of them from hot dry rock reservoir, which is about 300 times the fossil energy (Dickson and Fanelli 2013; Glassley 2014).The most important consideration for geothermal energy development in non-hydrothermal scenarios is the use of hydraulic fracturing technology to establish an effective network pathway to conduct fluid from injector(s) to producer(s). Most of the hot dry rock is base-crystalline rock and they are always a high mechanical strength, non-permeability in matrix and formed a large number of natural fractures under the action of tectonization. Therefore, the high injection pressure gradient and low injectivity indices become the primary problem in the development of hydraulic fracturing in hot dry rock geothermal development (Garnish 2002; Norbeck et al. 2015).|","Document Type

D., University of Colorado| Buscarnera, G., Northwestern University","|ABSTRACT: Hydrocarbon production or other activities involving extraction of underground fluids often cause surface subsidence with a time-lag. Such delay is often attributed to the rate-dependent rheological behavior of reservoir rocks. This paper proposes a thermomechanical model able to capture the rate-dependent behavior of unconsolidated sand while tracking grain breakage processes at the microscale. The energetics of subcritical crack propagation at grain scale is firstly investigated and the characteristics of its dissipation function are observed. A similar strategy is then used to generalize the dissipation function of a continuum breakage model. The extended model is characterized by a mathematical structure resembling Perzyna-type viscoplastic formulations and only involves two additional parameters, one controlling the magnitude of rate effects, and another coincident with the intrinsic corrosion index of the grain-forming mineral which controls both the intensity of the rate effects and the shape of the creep curves. The model is benchmarked against oedometric compression data for quartz sand. The predicted creep responses at various stress levels agree well with recorded measurements. In addition, the stress corrosion index indirectly calibrated from macroscopic data falls within the range observed from fracture tests on typical rock-forming minerals, thus corroborating the validity of the selected approach.
1. INTRODUCTION
Surface subsidence due to extraction of hydrocarbons has been shown to contribute significantly to the land loss of coastal areas, thus exacerbating the impact of natural subsidence associated with sediment supply. A notable example is coastal Louisiana, where surface subsidence and sea level rise have caused severe loss of vegetated land. With more than 2 million residents living in the coastal zone, it has been estimated that the land loss projected for the next 50 years will cost Louisiana more than $37 billion [1]. The primary cause of such significant subsidence has been actively investigated during the last few decades. Natural processes include compaction of Holocene sediments deposited in the Mississippi Delta, lithospheric flexure due to the sediment load, and faulting activities [2, 3]. However, these processes are estimated to cause rates of subsidence lower than 5 mm/yr, which is significantly less than the observed rate of 9<U+02DC>23 mm/yr [4]. Therefore, such mismatch is often attributed to the extensive oil and gas production activities characterizing the area. From a geomechanical perspective, the primary cause of surface deformation caused by fluid withdrawal is reservoir compaction due to effective stress increase during depletion. To tackle this problem, poroelastic analytical solutions have been developed by assuming a simple disk-shaped reservoir [5]. Recent studies, however showed that the viscous rheological behavior of the reservoir rocks needs to be taken into account in order to explain the observed accelerated subsidence rate which has followed the peak production rate in this region [4]. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the physical origin of such time-dependent process [4, 6, 7]. Among them, creep of weakly consolidated formations is has been identified as one of the primary causes [8, 9]. Such behavior has often been modeled through empirical or phenomenological models, as power law functions [7, 8, 10], viscoelastic models [9, 11, 12], and viscoplastic models [6]. However, few of these approaches have taken account for the particle-scale mechanisms that govern the macro-scale time effect.|","Document Type

This selection is not trivial given the inherent heterogeneity of rock masses. In strong rocks, step-path failures may develop through combination of planar shear along joints and failure through intact rock. The presence of rock bridges between discontinuities increases shear strength along potential failure surfaces. However, estimating rock bridge percentages is challenging in the absence of mapping and joint persistence information. The lack of joint continuity data is common to many open pit projects until construction begins and the rock masses are exposed. This paper describes the rock bridge characterization approach used for the proposed Jay Pit area of the Ekati Diamond Mine, for which joint persistence data are not currently available. The approach involved developing a discrete fracture network (DFN) model to estimate the amount of intact rock between discontinuities as a percentage of the total failure surface length. The model used discontinuity orientation and spacing data from borehole drilling at the site, and discontinuity persistence data from wall mapping in a nearby pit. Possible stepped failure paths were determined for various DFN model realizations, and rock bridge percentages were calculated along these paths. Rock bridge statistics were applied in the stability assessment to steepen the recommended pit slopes by up to 6°. |1. INTRODUCTION |As indicated by Call and Nicholas, 1978, a potential slope failure mode in jointed rock masses is a stepped path where the failure surface follows a combination of rock discontinuities. Where intact rock is present between discontinuities (i.e., rock bridges), the step-path surface must fail through the intact rock. While relatively small rock bridges of intact rock between otherwise continuous joints substantially increase strength, mapping of each joint and rock bridge is impossible on a practical basis (Einstein et al., 1983). When information on joint continuity is absent, before construction begins and the rock mass is exposed in the pit walls, alternative approaches are required to characterize rock bridging. One alternative approach consists in developing a discrete fracture network (DFN) model to estimate the percentage of intact rock between discontinuities. This method was used in the Feasibility Study for the Jay Pit at the Ekati Diamond Mine in Canada’s Northwest Territories.|","Document Type

For the first time, impacts of vertical confinement are incorporated to evaluate: flow-induced poro-elasto-plastic stresses, failure mechanism/s, and failure planes. A new fully-coupled numerical model is developed where the response of the injection layer in the plane perpendicular to injection flow is simulated through adopting “interface” – a plane on which sliding or separation can occur – analogous to the Winkler model. An assessment of pore pressures, stresses, and failure planes confirms two types of induced behaviors: dilation in the well vicinity; and compaction, a main cause of physical clogging which impacts competence of the operation. Numerical results describe multiple distinct zones evolving with time around the injection well: (1) liquefied domain, (2) multiple plastic domains, (3) elastic region. Inner plastic domains are prone to occur.
1. INTRODUCTION
The geo-environmental consequences of injecting large volumes of fluids into geological strata – a common practice in enhanced oil recovery, geothermal exploitation, aquifer storage and recovery, and deep waste disposal operations – remain a topic of dispute. The very essence of a safe and sustainable operation is to be able to quantify and control the induced subsurface flow and deformations, specifically to ensure preservation of sealing integrity of the confining rocks. This involves a realistic grasp of the interactions between the injection layer and the sealing strata, which entails a comprehensive understanding of the involved geomechanical processes.
Numerical computation of the injection problem in a confined weakly-consolidated formation is challenging due to the following: strong coupling between the diffusional-mechanical processes; high fluid-solid matrix stiffness contrast; plasticity and parting, where the strength and stiffness of the medium become effectively zero. This results in numerical instabilities and a considerably long run time of simulations. A common simplifying assumption in most available work in the literature is plane strain conditions perpendicular to the injection flow. This assumption is most appropriate for a case where a weakly consolidated reservoir formation is confined with stiff sealing rocks. In cases where the sealing rocks are of a softer nature, or when the stiffness of the reservoir layer increases over time during prolonged injection cycles, the plane strain assumption is no longer appropriate and the overall response of the injection layer is indeed governed by the behavior of the confining strata.|","Document Type

Conventionally, it has been believed that increase in size leads to decrease in strength. A few investigations have reported different trend to that consider conventionally where the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) follows ascending and descending behaviour. Masoumi et al. [1] investigated this behaviour from analytical and experimental viewpoints that resulted in the formulation of the unified size effect law (USEL) which accounts for the reverse size effect behaviour of intact rocks. A limitation of the current USEL is that at very large sizes, the UCS prediction by USEL tends to zero. This paper outlines an improvement to USEL to overcome this limitation based on the multifractal theory. Attributes of the improved USEL model were highlighted and verified using UCS data from different rock types. Finally, it was demonstrated that there is a good agreement between the improved USEL prediction and the experimental results.
1. INTRODUCTION
Size effect has been an important research issue in the general area of geomechanics where some investigations have focused on the mechanical properties of intact rock at different sizes. In this paper, the influence of three dimensional volumetric changes on the mechanical characteristics of intact rock is defined as the size effect.
Uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) is one of the most important mechanical properties of an intact rock which has long been studied by different researchers from the size effect viewpoint ([2-18]). Generally, it is believed that increase in size leads to decrease in strength. Initially, the size effect was explained by Weibull [19] as on a statistic phenomenon, whereby larger samples contain more micro-cracks than a smaller sample and thus the probability of failure at lower stress is higher with a larger sample. In other words, increase in size causes reduction in strength. This trend has been confirmed by other theories including fracture energy [20] and multifractals [21].|","Document Type

Most previous testing used pillar-shaped rock specimen as a result of the inconvenience and difficulties in processing rock into other geometry. The development of diamond-impregnated wire saw for rock processing provides us the opportunity to get large quantities of notch-precisely-machined specimens, whose shape are Double-Cantilever-Beam planks. The study here used Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) testing to obtain highly repeatable values of rock fracture toughness. Particle Flow Code 5.0 2D (PFC 2D) was used to simulate the whole testing process, on the other hand, the testing results were used to calibrate the PFC parameters in turn. Conclusion shows that model I fracture toughness of Longmaxi formation outcrop is around 1.55MNm-3/2. Critical tensile force has positive correlation with width of notch/crack tip. The study also indicates that in PFC simulation, micro tensile strength among balls (pb_ten) determines both model I fracture toughness and uniaxial compression strength. The study may guide the drilling process in recognizing the strength of rock fracture and provide experiment-based fracture toughness for the simulation of fracturing process.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fracture toughness of rock was scholars’ highly concern as most issues of rock mechanics are closely related to failure process, such as mining process and hydraulic fracturing, etc.
Lots of work has been done since the first suggested method of International Society for Rock Mechanics for rock fracture toughness testing1 was published. Since then, the testing method mentioned above is regarded as the standard method for static fracture toughness testing of rock. As the availability of pillar-shaped rock specimen, almost all the suggested methods used rock pillar to conduct fracture toughness testing. The machined specimen is shown in Fig. 1 (Atkinson 1987). In order to obtain the intrinsic fracturing property of rock, the notch of the specimen is machined to the shape of V or chevron. Displacement and force used to calculate fracture toughness is recorded after the fracture propagates a small distance to form a natural sharp crack, and that is what the shape of notch used to. This elaborate design eliminates the influence of machined notch width on fracture toughness because that the ‘natural sharp crack’ is thought to be a parameter merely related to rock property.|","Document Type

The comparison shows a good agreement between Simpleware and Comsol with a difference of <U+02DC>1% for effective elastic properties, <U+02DC>1-3% for permeability and 5% for effective conductivity. The Simpleware Physics Modules allow a streamlined workflow to compute effective properties and is especially suitable for processing a large number of digital samples. Comsol Multiphysics on the other hand allows more multiphysics coupling and access to internal field variables useful for research purposes. The NIST codes for elasticity and electrical conductivity are very efficient but are specifically only for those two physical properties.
1. INTRODUCTION
Computation of physical properties on 3-D CT-scanned digital rocks is used in geosciences applications, and a number of different workflows and algorithms have become available. We discuss a comparative study on elasticity and electrical conductivity in different rock types (Figure 1) using Simpleware, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Comsol Multiphysics codes. Permeability is also investigated using Simpleware and Lattice-Boltzmann permeability simulators. The 3D CT-scan images of different rock types are Sandstone (S2), Berea Sandstone, Fontainebleau Sandstone, Carbonate (C1) and Carbonate (C2), as well as digitized version of Finney pack with identical spheres (Figure 1). The materials for the grains and pore-fill assumed for the study were water, quartz, and calcite (for the carbonate rocks), with the following elastic properties and conductivities:
2. VOLUME MESHING
2.1. Simpleware (SW)
We import the 3D scan volumes of each sample in Simpleware ScanIP (Synopsys, Mountain View, USA) for image processing and segmentation. Since all of our 3D scan volumes are 100<U+00D7>100<U+00D7>100, each stack has 100 images of 100<U+00D7>100 size. We perform meshing using the Simpleware +FE-Free meshing algorithm with tetrahedral elements. For permeability, the Simpleware Physics Modules +SOLID, +FLOW and +LAPLACE are used with different mesh coarseness Since the rock model is based on a pre-segmented image (a binary image without any greyscale information reflecting the sub-voxel geometry of the sample), it is best to select the “Binarise before smoothing” option. In this way the meshing algorithm in Simpleware does not try to use any spurious greyscale information that might have been introduced into masks by thresholding, and the generated mesh has porosity closer to that of the original image.|","Document Type

In this paper we present results from CT imaging and mineralogical investigations of an Opalinus Clay core on different scales and different regions of interest, emphasizing especially the 3D evaluation and distribution of cracks and fractures and their impact upon mechanical testing of such material. Enhanced knowledge of the behaviour of the Opalinus Clay as a result of these tests is of great interest, especially since this material is considered for a long term radioactive waste disposal and storage facility in Switzerland. Hence, results are compared regarding the mineral (i.e. phase) contrast resolution, the spatial resolution, and the overall scanning speed.
With this extensive interdisciplinary top-down approach it has been possible to characterize the general fracture propagation in comparison to mineralogical and textural features of the Opalinus Clay. Additionally, and to the best of our knowledge, a so called mylonitic zone has been observed for the first time in an experimentally deformed Opalinus sample. The multi-scale results are in good accordance with data from naturally deformed Opalinus Clay samples, which allows systematic analysis under controlled laboratory conditions. Accompanying 3D imaging greatly enhances the capability of data interpretation and assessment of such material.
1. INTRODUCTION
In this study we present the investigations of an experimentally deformed Opalinus Clay (OPA, Kaufhold et al., 2016). The aim is the visualization of the shear failure at various scales to get more information about the deformation process. Enhanced knowledge of the testing behaviour of the OPA is of great interest, especially since this material is considered for a long term radioactive waste disposal and storage facility in Switzerland.
X-ray CT equipment are now frequently used for sample analysis because almost all geoscientific samples show 3D features which would be missed if analysing 2D sections only (e.g. by classical microscopy). These features include, for example, the abundance of minerals, location of particular particles towards bedding (or texture in general), pore system, cracks, and veins. The 3D distribution of these features can be extracted and used for a variety of numerical modelling purposes (Andra et al., 2013).|","Document Type

G., Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro| De Simone, M., Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro| Roehl, D., Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro","|ABSTRACT: This work presents a probabilistic analysis of wellbore integrity using analytical and numerical (finite element method - FEM) approaches. The safety of the wellbore is evaluated through a casing integrity criterion. To evaluate the stresses considering the construction and production phases, the analytical solution considers the main steps of the wellbore lifespan: initial stress state in the formation, drilling operation, casing construction, initial stress state in the cement, pressure changes inside the casing and pore pressure variation. For both approaches, plane strain conditions, continuous homogeneous isotropic media and linear elastic materials are considered. Although the model hypotheses are similar, the FEM modeling allows the construction of a wellbore model with imperfections such as a cement channel. The uncertainties in the elastic parameters of casing, cement and formation are incorporated into the analysis using the AMV+ and LHS methods. The failure criterion to assess loss of wellbore integrity is given in terms of the cumulative distribution curve. In addition, the most important variables are identified. With this information, it is possible to define a risk scenario, mitigation strategies and procedures for better data acquisition and monitoring during wellbore operation lifetime.
1. INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW
In the oil industry, several hazards, such as gas migration (Ravi et al., 2006 and Martins et al., 1997), are related to wellbore construction and production. To overcome these problems, simple solutions considering the relevant aspects of the engineering systems are a good tool for a preliminary design for everyday scenarios.
Many studies have investigated the wellbore stresses during the wellbore lifespan. Analytical solutions can reach good results and can simplify the assessment of the interaction between variables and their impact on the results. Xu et al., 2015 present a solution considering the thick walled cylinder theory for casing, cement and formation with internal pressure acting inside the casing. For the contact between materials, a fully sticky condition is adopted. In addition, an instantaneous uniform temperature increment is applied to all materials.|","Document Type

During the last few years, many works showing different discoveries about Vaca Muerta mechanical rock properties have been published. All of them are an invaluable piece of work; nevertheless, they do not give a full characterization of Vaca Muerta mechanical rock properties. Until today, many meters of core samples were recovered from Vaca Muerta formation and a complete set of rock mechanics laboratory tests have been performed on core plugs to accurately characterize all the parameters that governs the mechanical behavior of the rock. In addition, to further understand the variability in the mechanical response of the rock, changes in the setting up of the laboratory tests were done in similar plugs on a same core sample (sister samples). It is the aim of this paper to present an overview of recent Vaca Muerta research works which include mechanical laboratory characterization of the rock and discuss about how different laboratory test parameters such as temperature, confining pressure, time, and fluid saturation among others affects the mechanical response of the rock. To complete the understanding of the Vaca Muerta formation mechanical behavior, special laboratory studies like Biot's coefficient and creep test were performed in some core shale gas samples; nevertheless, in this work, the quality and validity of these results are left as an open discussion. The most important conclusion of the analysis done in this work is that some elastic properties are not mainly controlled by the “rock families or facies”. As a result, a unique correlation between many elastic properties has been found and a simple workflow to fully characterize the rock mechanical properties of Vaca Muerta formation is proposed.
1. INTRODUCTION
During the exploration, delineation and development of the principal shale oil and gas reservoirs in Argentina, several studies like petrophysics, geochemistry, biostratigraphy and geomechanics haves been done. In order to calibrate the parameters of different models many meters of core has been recovered from the Vaca Muerta formation in the Neuquen basin, Argentina. This core acquisition was fundamental for the correct characterization of the mechanical rock properties. These properties play a fundamental role in every stage in the life of a well i.e. drilling process (wellbore stability), fracturing process and finally production forecasting.|","Document Type

T., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","|ABSTRACT: In order to understand and to predict the response of EBS, we simulate a clay-rock repository case considering chemo-mechanical coupling, in which chemical changes affect the mechanical behavior of the bentonite through the evolution of volume fraction of smectite, exchangeable cation concentration, and ionic strength (via osmotic suction). The mechanical model for the buffer is based on an existing double-structure formulation that accounts for the deformations at two structure levels, microstructure and macrostructure. Chemical effects are defined and coupled with the mechanical model at the microstructural level. This new model is implemented into a numerical simulator based on sequential coupling of the reactive transport simulator TOUGHREACT and the geomechanical simulator FLAC3D. The simulator denoted TOUGHREACT-FLAC is used to model the EBS behavior to predict the effects of chemical reactions on the stress evolution for generic case of a repository in a clay host rock. The simulation results illustrate the phenomenon of chemical-mechanical interactions and geomechanical performance of the repository to evaluate the potential deterioration of EBS bentonite, and to support the decision making in the design of a nuclear waste repository.
1. INTRODUCTION
Engineered Barrier Systems (EBS) are designed to isolate the high-level radioactive waste emplaced in tunnels in deep geological formations. The heat emanated from the waste can drive the moisture flow transport, induce coupled chemo-mechanical processes within the system, and may also impact the evolution of the excavation disturbed zone and the sealing between the buffer and walls of an emplacement tunnel. Rocks with low permeability and low diffusion coefficient are considered as host rock for geological disposal. Potential host rocks include granite (Gens et al., 2009), salt rock (Blanco-Martin et al., 2015; Zhu and Arson, 2014) and clay/shale formations (Gens et al., 2007; Rutqvist et al., 2014). Bentonite-based clays are chosen as the buffer in EBS because of several favorable properties such as its swelling capability when hydrating. This characteristic of bentonite can provide a swelling stress and support on the wall of emplacement tunnels that reduces the effects of fractures on bulk permeability and is of particular importance for the sealing and healing of disturbed rock zones. However, the induced chemical alteration of bentonite-based buffer through illitization may compromise the function of these EBS components by reducing their plasticity and capability to swell under wetting.|","Document Type

Recently, sudden permeability jumps have been observed in the deeper part of the basin after significant drawdown. The behavior has been explained by the desorption induced loss of horizontal stress, resulting in stress anisotropy and shear failure of coal. The permeability models currently used are capable of predicting coal permeability prior to failure, that is, in the elastic zone, but not beyond that. This paper is an attempt towards developing a permeability model beyond the linear elastic behavior of coal in the reservoir. The model is able to predict the sudden uptick in permeability with increased dilatancy and coal failure. At this time, the permeability model is empirical, and piece-wise for the three zones: elastic, dilatancy and post-failure. The model is able to match experimental data available for San Juan coal well. Advancing the model would not only enable prediction of coal permeability over the entire life of a producing reservoir but it can be extended to shale gas formations as well.
1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The performance of a reservoir depends largely on its permeability, which, in turn, changes dynamically over the life of a reservoir. The permeability change in sorptive rocks, like coal and shale formations, is even more significant compared to conventional reservoirs given their unique gas storage characteristics, where a significant portion of the gas is in adsorbed state. In coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs, it is well accepted that permeability is dependent on two different dynamics affecting the reservoir simultaneously. First, the mean effective stress increases with depletion, inducing compaction in the reservoir and leading to a decrease in the permeability. Second, with depletion in CBM reservoirs, coal matrix shrinks, resulting in relaxation of the matrix and, hence, increased permeability. These two processes are dominant in the elastic deformation of the reservoir. There have been several studies and permeability models published in the literature, coupling the two phenomena for elastic deformation in CBM reservoirs (Cui and Bustin, 2005; Liu et al., 2012; Palmer et al., 2009; Sawyer et al., 1990; Shi and Durucan, 2010, 2005, 2004).|","Document Type

The low permeability nature of coal seams exacerbates with the stress increase at deeper levels. This growing challenge is often not addressed effectively by the current gas drainage methods applied in coal mines. In recent years, slotting via hydraulic or mechanical force along underground gas drainage boreholes, as a general solution to stimulate low permeability coal reservoirs, has attracted increasingly attention. However, the role of prevailing stress state, coal properties, and slot geometry are the critical parameters to be considered in slotting operations. There has been no systematic research on assessing these key parameters and understanding the sensitivity of individual parameters in affecting slotting performance. By quantitatively assessing a series of numerical modelling scenarios, this paper aims at identifying the key parameters controlling slotting operation, analysing the sensitivity of individual parameters, and optimising slotting operation. Internal friction angle, slot diameter and the ratio of the maximum principal stress to minimum principal stress have been identified as the top three parameters affecting slotting performance.
1. INTRODUCTION
Coal mining is extending to deeper and deeper levels, facing ever increasing coal seam methane contents and much higher methane emissions at production districts. Increased gas content of coal seams with depth, and the introduction of concentrated coal exploitation within the last 15 years, has been the major reason for the increase of methane emissions. The increased release of methane observed with increasing depth is not only a serious safety risk, but also represents a problem for coal production, as it limits the advance rates of both headings and longwalls.
It has been recognised that gas drainage boreholes deployed from the underground and/or surface to capture coal seam gas before it migrates into the ventilation air or atmosphere provide a feasible solution to the gas emission problem. The primary limitation of applying methane drainage systems to reduce emissions in coal mining comes from the low permeability nature of coal seam reservoirs. For example, except for the Qinshui Basin, coal permeability in China, the largest coal producer and consumer in the world, is generally very low (1<U+00D7>10<U+2212>19 – 1<U+00D7>10<U+2212>18 m2), about four orders of magnitude lower than that of some US coals (Cheng et al., 2011). In some European coal basins, the permeability is reported to be as low as 10<U+2212>21 m2, and normally in the range of 1<U+00D7>10<U+2212>17 – 1<U+00D7>10<U+2212>12 m2 (Durucan and Edwards, 1986). Gas pre-drainage from boreholes drilled into these low permeability coal seams becomes ineffective due to extremely low gas flow rates. This situation may be further exacerbated since the average low life-span of underground drainage boreholes seriously limits the drainage time.|","Document Type

Such mechanical responses especially to hydraulic fracturing fluids control the leak-off rate and near fracture permeability evolution and therefore is crucial for hydrocarbon production. Therefore, we ran a series of systematic experiments by exposing organic matter rich shale samples to ionic solutions (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2 and CaCl2) with different concentrations (0.2, 1 and 2M) at controlled temperature. Images of the samples at their initial and wet states (exposed to ionic solutions for 7 hrs at 25 °C temperature) were taken using environmental electron microscope. The image processing was performed to register the images and extract the evolved features. Digital Image Correlation was further employed to calculate the strain field developed by change in sample structure in order to investigate the likelihood of micro-fracture development. From the results of this study, it was found that a) the sample exposed to 0.2M NaCl solution experienced the most significant micro-structural changes especially clay hydration while the sample exposed to 0.2M CaCl2 solution almost showed no changes, b) the sample exposed to 0.2M KCl solution on the other hand showed no/little swelling but its pore space was increased, c) surprisingly the micro-structural changes were more pronounced at 1.0M concentration of all ionic solutions especially for those with divalent ions, d) Digital Image Correlation analysis confirmed that micro-fracture development is more likely to occur when the sample is exposed to solutions of monovalent ions in particular NaCl.
1. INTRODUCTION
Despite long-time research carried out on clay rich sediments, the micro-structural evolution of these types of rocks when exposed to different ionic solutions has not been yet fully understood. Understanding such micro-structural evolution has wide range of applications in many engineering disciplines such as petroleum engineering [1, 2], nuclear waste disposal [3] and groundwater investigation [4]. This is especially pronounced for hydraulic fracturing operation as one of the key requirements for development of many unconventional resources. Among several examples, the low recovery of hydraulic fracturing fluid in unconventional shale reservoirs and its link to microstructural alteration is of great interest [5, 6].|","Document Type

In this paper mechanics analysis and numerical simulation based on boundary element method have been done to caculate refracture morphology under the altered-stress condition and discusses related influencing factors. Then both of large scale experiment in lab and tiltmeter monitoring in field confirmed fracture reorientation. It showed there were three possible refrac results: (a) a new fracture would initiate at some angles even orthogonal to the azimuth of the initial fracture which is closed. (b) the initial fracture would reopen firstly and a new fracture would initiate at some angles subsequently. (c) instead of new fracture initiation, the initial fracture would reopen and reorient along the direction of maximum stress. The initial and reversal stresses, rock tensile strength, Young Modulus, fracture toughness and pumping parameters determine refrac results together. Field test also confirmed temporary plugging could make multiple fractures initiation to increase drainage area and enhance well production in refracturing. Although a part of the experimental settings is prepared for the special oilfield in China, the conclusions drawn in this study are rather general for refracturing design.
1. INTRODUCTION
As the crude oil price is depressing in the recent years, Refracturing is playing more and more important role in enhancing oil recovery and lowing development cost for many international oil companies[1-3]. Especially for unconventional reservoirs, due to the ultra-low permeability, the well production keeping stable yield is difficult after first fracturing and it decreases severely in short term. In order to boost oil or gas flowing channels, improve the reservoir producing reserve, and enhance the oil or gas well ability of stable production for longer period, refracturing treatment is the first choice.
Elbel [4] proposed the mechanism of in situ stress field redistribution around refracturing wells. It said that the existence of initial fracture and the pore pressure decreasing due to production would cause the changing of the in situ stress direction and value around the wellbore. In extreme conditions, the reversal of the maximum and minimum horizontal principal stress direction could occur. Then the initiation and propagation of refracture would become more complicated. Siebrits [5] established a three-dimensional numerical model to simulate the disturbing in situ stress field and analyzed the sensitivity factors effecting on the disturbed stress caused by pore pressure. The optimization principles for refracturing wells were also discussed. Wei-ping du [6], Liu hong [7], Yongquan Hu [8], Nicolas [9] established more advanced three-dimensional numerical model, and introduced the factor of initial fracture opening into the model. So much more comprehensive studies about the influence on the re-orientation stress field were conducted. Liu[10], Sieberits[11] have studied the refracture propagating path under changed in-situ stress conditions according to physical simulation experiment and field refracturing monitoring. Through the analysis of well production, it confirmed the re-orientation of refractures could help enhancing the well performance.|","Document Type

Here we show how fracture opening affects the in situ elastic stresses and the pore pressure diffusion profiles, and subsequently potential of shear slippages along pre-existing fault planes. We compute the Coulomb failure function for a stationary hydraulic fracture by combining the elastic stress perturbations due to opening of the fracture and the pore pressure changes due to fluid diffusion in the surrounding rock. Results show that for a fixed length of hydraulic fracture, the first events in time occur near the crack tip region where the Coulomb stress changes are positive due to elastic stress perturbations. The pore pressure diffusion subsequently leads to microseismic events near the fracture face where elastic stress perturbations have a stabilizing effect. Thus the elastic stress changes ahead of the crack tip due to fracture opening facilitate failure and this process affects the spatio-temporal distributions of microseismicity.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs like shales and tight sands open cracks and fractures thereby enhancing permeability and subsequent hydrocarbon production. The creation/reactivation of a fracture network perturbs in situ stresses causing small energy release in the form of microseismic events. Monitoring of these microseismic events helps in spatial mapping of the hydraulic fractures (Rutledge and Phillips, 2003; Maxwell et al., 2002; Cipolla et al., 2011). The spatio-temporal patterns of microseismic clouds around hydraulic fractures can reveal features of the various physical processes active during hydraulic fracturing.
Most studies of injection induced seismicity assume that the changes in pore pressure alone are responsible for triggering seismicity (Pearson, 1981; Shapiro et al., 2002). In this study we show the impact of the opening of a hydraulic fracture on in situ stresses and pore pressure diffusion profile and subsequently on the observed microseismicity. We compute the Coulomb failure function on pre-existing faults due to a stationary hydraulic fracture modeled as a penny shaped (oblate spheroidal) cavity filled with fluid at uniform pressure. The elastic stress changes are computed using Eshelby’s equivalent inclusion method whereas pore pressure diffusion profiles are generated by considering the fluid filled cavity as the source. For a stationary fracture we show that the first events occur close to the crack tip region. Furthermore the microseismic cloud mimics the shape of the hydraulic fracture especially close to its surface.|","Document Type

This report outlines the system, the gives examples of application to open-cut excavation and tunnel construction, and presents details of the system using construction information modeling/management concepts.
1. INTRODUCTION
The deformation and failure of slopes are important considerations in excavation under difficult ground conditions such as in areas with soft ground, in areas prone to landslides, and in urban areas with neighboring constructions. Therefore, to evaluate the stability of rock slopes and ensure the safety of a construction, many sensors are typically placed to monitor the condition of the ground as the construction progresses.
However, it is difficult to integrate data processing with a variety of measuring instruments that are supplied by different manufacturers and placed on the ground and underground. Furthermore, quick and comprehensive processing of measurement data is absolutely imperative for understanding the situation when slope deformation or failure occurs as a result of rain or an earthquake, but a problem with conventional systems is that they require a long time to comprehensively evaluate stability when data from different measuring instruments must be processed separately. To solve this problem, we have developed a slope-measuring three-dimensional information and communication technology (3D-ICT) system, called the Hazama Ando Automatic Monitoring System (HAMONIS), that can handle various measuring instruments and that integrates the measurement data and provide them over the Internet in real time (see Fig. 1).|","Document Type

E., Schlumberger Moscow Research","|ABSTRACT: A hydraulic fracture does not immediately stop and close at the time of well shut-in, but keeps growing and stays open for certain time after the end of the treatment. In this paper, we study the dynamics of continued hydraulic fracture propagation in rocks followed by subsequent fracture closure for different parametric regimes of fracture propagation. Because of possible deviation from a viscosity-dominated regime, we revisit the classical PKN model of hydraulic fracture by including the influence of fracture toughness of rock. That allows us to keep track of the time interplay between all volume and energy components, including viscous and surface dissipation rates. Depending on the parameters of fluid injection and rock, after the pumps are stopped, a hydraulic fracture continues to grow. After the termination of growth, the fracture stays statically open for a limited time, which is indicated by a specific signature in the wellbore pressure record. The final stage of fracture closing is associated with the heterogeneous fracture closure from the tip to inlet.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is widely used to increase transmissivity of reservoir fluids from rock to a fractured well (Valko and Economides, 1995; Economides and Nolte, 2000). To create the hydraulic fractures, the fluids are pumped into a wellbore from surface using the high- pressure pumps. During the fluid injection, the hydraulic fracture is entirely mechanically open and readily transports the injected fluids and proppants along the fracturing path. After the injection is finished, the fracture aperture gradually decreases. Rigorous fracture modeling shows that after shut-in the fracture does not close immediately but stays open for a noticeable amount of time (Detournay et al., 1990; Garagash, 2006; Lakirouhani et al., 2016). The duration of “open fracture life” is important for stimulation treatment because only in this period may the fracture continue propagating, keep and transport significant fluid volumes inside. Such a transient fracture behavior is important for flowback operation too. The recovery of injected water may depend on the time of flowback, fracture length, opening and storage volume.|","Document Type

The increase in these forces decreases the transfer efficiency of energy, which limits the potential depth the drill string and tubulars can reach. This paper illustrates the benefit of incorporating barite nanoparticles (NP) into Water Based Mud (WBM). Two formulations of 10 ppg API standard barite WBM with different rheologies were utilized as base cases. Chemical and mechanical methods of barite NP generation were used. This facilitated a better understanding of the effect of each NP generation mechanism on the friction coefficient (CoF). The experiment speculated that nano sized particles can generate a smooth film that coats the surfaces resulting in friction reduction. NP also increase mud rheology by providing more individual particles for a given concentration. This research aims to continue understanding barite NP performance, behavior, and their effect on the CoF and mud rheology for WBM systems. An application will be discussed in this paper to highlight the potential benefits.
1. INTRODUCTION
WBM is gaining more popularity worldwide. It has started to overtake the Oil Based Mud (OBM) market share. This trend is influenced by the changing in environmental regulations, cost and more importantly the advancements in WBM technology. Developing WBM systems that match the performance of OBM is demanded now more than ever. Lubrication additives, borehole stabilizers, and enhanced high temperature polymers are all being sought (Sifferman et al. 2003).
The successful application of nanotechnology in medicine, electronics, paints, coatings, and many other fields motivated the oil industry to take the same path. Reservoir data has also been gathered utilizing nano-sensors and nano-markers (Hoelscher et al. 2013). These achievements have inspired the investigation of nano additives in drilling fluids in an attempt to address existing difficulties; namely shale inhibition, rheology modification, wellbore strengthening, and lubricity.
A clear illustration of the importance of developing such innovative NP WBM drilling fluids is the mitigation of the frictional forces in horizontal or extended reach wells. It can substantially increase the rig and equipment reach limit by efficiently transferring energy. A finite element analysis (FEA) approach, taken by Hareland, indicated the benefits gained by lowering CoF in complex directional wells. As a sample illustration, a 3,900 ft of lateral extension were obtained while keeping torque, buoyancy and downhole weight on bit constant (Hareland et al. 2012).|","Document Type

A unique Pore Pressure Transmission (PPT) apparatus was used to evaluate the plugging capabilities of the mixtures. Results showed that the presence of nanocomposite was conductive to forming a thinner impermeable mud-cake to effectively reduce water invasion and prevent pore pressure transmission into the water-sensitive shales formation at an earlier stage of the shale-fluid interactions. However, the pore pressure would gradually increase over time if only LCM materials were in the existence of the drilling mud. When the test time went on for 8 hours, the downstream pressure increased to 80% of the upstream pressure. Results also showed that the combination of nanocomposites and the conventional LCM materials in appropriate proportion could create a lasting and effective sealing during drilling in shales, but the combinational material was incapable of sealing the fracture seen by the naked eye. Hence, the fast sealing developed through the combinational method was essential to resolve the problems of wellbore instability in Shales.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wellbore instability in shale is one of the most common and costly problems in drilling operations since shales with high clay content is high sensitivity to water-based muds (Steiger and Leung 1992). According to the statistics, shales occupy over 75 % of drilled formations, and about 90% of borehole instability problems caused by shale formations (Lal 1999). Meanwhile, the drilling problems also lead to annual expenditure of $700 million for oil and gas industry (Tare et al. 2000). In the past, some research indicated that it was impossible to minimize drilling fluid loss effectively towards to shale formations with the conventional sealing-agent. This was because that the range of throats sizes in shales was in the range of 5-50nm that was much smaller than the size of conventional plugging materials (Abrams 1977, Al-Bazali et al. 2006, Sensoy et al. 2009, Kuila and Prasad 2013). It was believed that traditional drilling fluids could not form mud cake in the vicinity of the borehole (Hoelscher et al. 2012). Notably, it was because of the low permeability and high capillary suction of the shale matrix that the drilling mud pressure in the borehole was easily transmitted to the pore fluid pressure, leading to wellbore instability when drilling in shale formations with overbalance pressure (Al-Arfaj et al. 2014).|","Document Type

This paper suggests a new method for detecting fracture surfaces from CT images using an edge detection algorithm that is known well in the field of image processing as Canny edge detection. Applying this edge detection method to the CT images of a single granite fracture, 15 mm in diameter and 30 mm in length, this study successfully measures the fracture surface geometry, the aperture distribution, and the contact ratio.
1. INTRODUCTION
Taking precise measurements of the geometric characteristics of rock fractures, such as the elevation distribution of fracture walls, the distribution of apertures, and the contacting asperities within the fractures, is essential because of their significant influence on the mechanical and hydrological behaviors of rock fractures. On a laboratory scale, the elevation distribution of fracture walls can be measured with micrometer accuracy using a system that combines a laser displacement sensor and a high-precision automatic positioning stage (e.g., [1]).
However, the distribution of apertures and the contacting conditions within a fracture are rather difficult to measure experimentally. In previous researches, various techniques have been proposed, such as 1) the surface topography approach, in which the topography of a pair of fracture surfaces is measured separately by a laser beam profiler, while the aperture is computed indirectly as the distance between the two fracture surfaces [2, 3]; 2) the injection approach, in which the specimen containing the fracture is cut into slices after some resin has been injected, and the aperture is measured as the thickness of the injected resin [4, 5]; and 3) the casting approach, in which replicas of the fracture apertures are made by casting [6].|","Document Type

Specific energy data were collected during drilling of over 100,000 blast holes. Specific energy is affected not only by the geomechanical properties of the rock being drilled, but also by drilling parameters, equipment wear, and drilling depth. The influence of these factors is partly mitigated by adjusting the dataset for drilling depth and applying a bilateral smoothing filter. The specific energy dataset is compared to known pit-scale faults, UAV photogrammetry, LiDAR models, and rock mass data from geotechnical drilling. Planar concentrations of low specific energy data are seen to correspond to the location of major faults. This is evidenced further by showing that specific energy increases with distance from faults, similar to rock mass quality.
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding the spatial distribution of rock strength and the location of faults is important for open pit slope design. The spatial distribution of rock strength can indicate the location and size of faulting, weathering, and weaker geotechnical units. Because of the cost of geotechnical drill holes, the spatial distribution of rock strength and the locations of faults are often interpreted from limited data. For example, the orientation of a fault intersected by a geotechnical drill hole might be measured using oriented drill core. This measurement may be representative of the fault at the intersection, but may not reflect the complex orientation or shape of the fault at the pit slope scale. A data set with broader spatial coverage is needed to improve fault interpretations.
’Specific energy’ is defined as the energy required to excavate a unit volume of rock and when first introduced (Teale, 1965) was noted to be a function of rock strength. Given the spatial coverage of blast holes in open pit mines, specific energy has significant potential for the identification of zones of weak rock and in the interpretation of faults for open pit slope design.|","Document Type

M., Principal Research Engineer","|ABSTRACT: A numerical-model-based approach was recently developed by researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for estimating the changes in both the horizontal and vertical loading conditions induced by an approaching longwall face. In this approach, a systematic procedure is used to estimate the model’s inputs. Shearing along the bedding planes is modeled with ubiquitous joint elements and interface elements. Coal is modeled with a newly developed coal mass model at NIOSH’s Pittsburgh Mining Research Division (PMRD). The response of the gob is calibrated with back analysis of subsidence data and the results of previously published laboratory tests on rock fragments. The model results were verified with the subsidence and stress data recently collected by PMRD from a longwall mine in the eastern United States, and with published cases studies from both eastern and western U.S. mines.
1. INTRODUCTION
In 2015, there were 40 longwall mines operating in the United States, each producing an average of 4.5 million tons of coal per year. The largest concentrations of longwall faces are found in West Virginia with 13 longwalls, followed by Illinois (7), Pennsylvania (5) and Alabama (5) (Fiskor, 2016).
In 2015, these forty longwall mines supplied 60% of the U.S. underground coal production. This represents a substantial increase from 50% over the previous three years (Sears et al., 2017). During this period, reportable roof fall rates in U.S. longwall mines also increased. Large roof falls that can block the gateroads are not only a ground fall hazard; they disrupt the ventilation system, can block the escapeways, and can increase the potential for elevated methane levels in the gob. To address the recent increase in reportable roof falls, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Mining Research Division (PMRD) started a research project to improve ground control in longwall gateroads.|","Document Type

In this work, six mudstone source rock samples from unconventional reservoir wells have been tested for measuring their grain bulk moduli, bulk moduli, and the stress dependent Biot’s effective stress coefficients. Grain bulk moduli of these samples range from 60 GPa to 90 GPa. Biot’s effective stress coefficients for all the samples decrease from 0.90 or higher to 0.70 or lower with increasing effective stress illustrating the stress dependency of Biot’s coefficient. Furthermore, the different values of Biot’s coefficients along the vertical and horizontal directions indicate that Biot’s coefficient is indeed a tensor quantity for anisotropic mudstone source rocks, so that pore pressure changes not only modify the normal stress but also induce shear stress changes. Experiments also show that mudstone source rock samples expand when nitrogen gas is used as the testing fluid (gas absorption), and the degree of such expansion is related to the absorbed gas quantity and organic matter content.

Rockfall scars are identified and isolated by comparing successive LiDAR point clouds. Rock bridges are first characterized visually using 2D photographic trace mapping, and categorized as either coplanar with existing discontinuities or non-coplanar. Using an automated facet detection technique, and comparing the results to known mapped structures, we estimate the proportion of non-coplanar rock bridge fracturing contributing to rockfalls of various sizes. Roughness is used as an indicator of coplanar rock bridge fracturing, and roughness thresholds are estimated by comparing areas of highest roughness to damage trace maps. Finally, intact rock bridge estimates are used in a time-dependent degradation UDEC model to simulate progressive damage over the life of the mine. Modelling results show similar behavior to measured slope displacements, showing the importance of accounting for progressive intact rock fracturing over time. |1. INTRODUCTION |The contact walls of a glory hole at Diavik Diamond Mine present a challenge for predicting the magnitude and frequency of rockfall. On the southeast (SE) contact wall of the A154S kimberlite pipe, steeply dipping, highly persistent discontinuities are observed. When rockfall does occur, it is due to a combination of failure along the surface of these discontinuities and progressive brittle fracturing in intact rock. As mining progresses downwards and ore rock is removed, progressive brittle fracturing in the exposed host rock occurs from a combination of loss of confinement and introduction of freeze-thaw cycles. Previous studies have shown that a larger scale pit wall failure would require shearing through intact rock (Elmo et al., 2009; Moffitt et al., 2007), which appears to occur at smaller scales as well. |This study shows the potential for terrestrial LiDAR in understanding past rockfalls and evaluating future ones. Terrestrial LiDAR can be used forensically to characterize failure surface morphology and estimate brittle fracture progression prior to rockfall.

J., The University of Texas| Sharma, Mukul M., The University of Texas","|ABSTRACT: Boundary element methods such as the displacement discontinuity method (DDM) are promising for describing the geo-mechanics of growing fractures as they reduce the dimensionality of the problem by one. Still, this advantage is overshadowed by the computational power required to model stage scale simulations of hydraulic fractures primarily due to the nonlinearity arising from fluid flow inside the fracture. Typical assumptions to improve the computational efficiency lead to the inability of simulators to describe proppant transport which is critical to treatment design. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to increase the speed of convergence of coupled geomechanics (DDM) and fluid flow problem. The algorithm employs an analytical, local linear approximation of the Reynolds lubrication equation to solve the coupled non-linear system of equations. An initial solution is estimated through the linear system, and it is then used in the iterative solution approach for the non-linear system as an initial guess. This improvement has allowed us to use the algorithm to develop a fully three-dimensional hydraulic fracturing simulator which can run in an acceptable runtime using commonly available computational power.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing has made economical recovery from low permeability shale reservoirs possible. With the advancement of hydraulic fracturing technology, multistage fracturing of horizontal wells has become ubiquitous. The complexity of the involved physical process, geological spatial variability and complexity, and limited access to the treated formation make it difficult to achieve reliable completion designs (Damjanac and Cundall, 2015). To address this problem, the selection of crucial design parameters is commonly done by duplicating a completion design from successful analog fields and optimizing it by trial and error. As every shale is unique, this strategy is costly and has an associated learning curve for design engineers (Leem and Reyna, 2014). Also, the behavior of proppant transport inside multiple growing fractures adds additional complexity to the process, and hence it becomes too intricate to model without numerical and computational techniques. This generates the need for a comprehensive hydraulic fracturing simulator which can account for all the key factors and assist in the completion process, thus reducing the cost and time required for achieving optimum designs.|","Document Type

We show that size effect in direct tension is statistically insignificant. Sample size is not critically important in calibrating the tensile strength. On the other hand, failure mechanisms in the Brazilian test depend on not only the material properties but also sample size. In addition to the conventional diametrical splitting failure resulted from initiation and propagation of a center crack, alternative failure scenarios involving formation of damaged zones near the loading points are also possible. The Brazilian tensile strength could either underestimate or overestimate the intrinsic tensile strength. Direct tension instead of the Brazilian test should therefore be conducted for material property calibration. We also show that a displacement-softening contact law can resolve the issue of low compressive over tensile strength ratio in DEM modeling. By adjusting the softening coefficient, a realistic strength ratio can be obtained and the conventional diametrical failure pattern can be reproduced in the Brazilian test.
1. INTRODUCTION
Tensile strength of rocks is often measured indirectly through laboratory tests such as the Brazilian test and three-point bending. These tests are indirect because the stress state at the location where failure initiates is not in uniaxial tension and the tensile stress along the failure plane could be non-uniform. Nevertheless, compared with the direct tension test, these indirect tests are more robust to perform in the laboratory and are justified since experimental evidences indicate that failure in confined extension still occurs according to the uniaxial tensile strength, if the magnitude of the compressive principal stress in a biaxial stress state is no more than a few times of the tensile stress (Brace, 1964; Murrell, 1965; Hoek and Bieniawski, 1965; Ramsey and Chester, 2004; Hoek and Martin, 2014).
Differences in the tensile strengths obtained from the indirect and direct tests are well recognized. An extensive survey of the experimental results (Perras and Diederichs, 2014) suggests that depending on the rock types, the Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) could both overestimate and underestimate the uniaxial tensile strength (UTS). The ratio of BTS/UTS was found to scatter in between 0.56 (trachyte) and 1.86 (sandstone).|","Document Type

The injection process is modeled with the simplification that fluid leakoff is negligible. The fluid can penetrate in between grains and fluid front advances only if the gap size between two neighboring grains exceed a threshold value. Such a simplification can be considered as similar to taking into account of the effect of surface tension. Dependence of the fluid-grain displacement patterns on the threshold gap size is analyzed for the cases of constant rate injection. A bifurcation analysis for cavity expansion of a thick-walled cylinder is performed to predict the borehole pressure versus volume relationship. The critical pressure corresponding to the onset of bifurcation is compared with the peak injection pressure obtained from the numerical simulations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Failure mechanisms due to fluid injection in a nearly unconsolidated formation are not yet well understood due to the highly nonlinear and coupled nature of the problem. It is generally assumed that onset of failure may occur in a tensile or a shear mode, depending on whether cohesion is present or not. In a cohesive medium, fluid pressurization in a borehole is assumed to lead to tensile crack initiation and propagation. On the other hand, for a cohesionless material, a constitutive model of Coulomb type predicts that the material must fail in shear and failure may be manifested in the formation of spiral-shaped shear bands.
Evidences of shear band development were observed in the cavity expansion experiments in dry sands in Alsiny et al. (1992), where borehole pressurization is realized by inflating a membrane. In these experiments, the membrane does not penetrate into the sands. Meanwhile, the experiments in Chang (2004), performed by injecting a highly viscous fluid into dry sands or silica flour, demonstrate that planar features resembling an opening mode crack can be created in a purely frictional granular material. A major difference between these two experiments is the pressurization mechanism. We therefore conjecture that the action of fluid penetration to cause grain displacements is a critical element in producing the opening mode crack- or finger-like features.
In this study, the effect of fluid penetration on the fluid-grain displacement patterns in a cohesionless medium is investigated using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) code PFC2D® (Itasca, 2015). A numerical scheme is devised to consider a particular case, where the injected fluid is highly viscous and can penetrate into open spaces in between grains if the gap size between two neighboring grains exceeds a threshold value. Such an implementation could be considered analogous to taking into account the effect of surface tension without leakoff; the larger the critical gap size, the higher the surface tension or the fluid viscosity.|","Document Type

The added fibers not only assist in the transport of proppant based on mechanical suspension but also prevent proppant settling during fracture closure. Although the chemical composition of the fibers used is not described, their characteristics suggest that they are made of PLA materials. In our experiments, we tested both PGA and PLA fibrous materials using a small scale slotted equipment. The results showed that mixing fibers with a small amount of polymer significantly helped transporting proppant. From the preliminary tests, PLA fibers crumbled and tended to induce proppant screen-out often; thus, only PGA materials were used for the proppant transport experiments. Since the PGA materials were cost prohibitive, we determined the optimum concentration of PGA fibers by changing the polymer concentration of frac fluid and injection rate. We concluded that the suitable amount of fibers is around 0.567 kg (1.25 lbs) / 3785.4 liters (1000 gallons) of slick water. This concentration is economically feasible given that the total fluid injection volume is large for hydraulic fracturing applications.
1. INTRODUCTION
We have been testing PGA (Polyglycolic Acid) and PLA (Polylactic Acid) materials for seven years as a fluid-loss control agent. Since the combination of PGA fibers and PGA powder was proven an effective fluid-loss control agent, we further tested it for transporting proppant while minimizing fluid-loss for slick-water fracturing. The tests used a clear small scale proppant transport system. PGA fibers and proppant were mixed with slick water and pumped through a slotted panel made of acrylic plastic to study proppant transport in an open fracture. We pumped the slurry at constant flow rates and observed the proppant distribution. The experiment demonstrated relatively uniform distributions of proppant flow without the formation of proppant bank near the inlet.
A service company has documented the application of a low viscous, fiber-laden fluid that can transport proppant effectively. The fibers assist in the transportion of proppant based on a suspension mechanism and prevent proppant settling during fracture closure. The company mentions “degradable materials,” “biodegradable fiber” or “degradable divergent agents” without explicitly citing chemical names and their necessary properties for applications.

O., Itasca Consulting Group, Inc.","|ABSTRACT: We explore the feasibility of using a bonded-particle model (BPM) to simulate the rock disaggregation process occurring near a wellbore perforation in sandstone by addressing the simpler question: Can we construct a 2D BPM that produces surface fragments when subjected to boundary conditions similar to those around a wellbore perforation in dry sandstone? The answer to this question is yes. We can construct a 2D flat-jointed material to represent Castlegate sandstone. Our synthetic material matches much of the macroscopic response (including the direct-tension and unconfined-compressive strengths) and many of the mechanisms that occur during direct-tension and compression tests as well as the trends in the macroscopic response and the primary mechanism that occurs during thick-walled cylinder (TWC) tests to produce a breakout failure type. The primary mechanism is termed “buckling-assisted fragmentation,” in which a buckling and spalling process produces thin fragments of rock similar to onion skins, and thereby produces a breakout failure type. The perforation-collapse behavior of our synthetic material is related to the hole resolution (defined as the number of grains across the borehole diameter), with TWC strength decreasing as hole resolution increases. This observation suggests that perforation strength in a given material will decrease with increasing perforation size.
1. INTRODUCTION
The sand-production process that occurs near a wellbore perforation in competent sandstone in response to hydrocarbon production can be described by a two-stage conceptual model in which the perforation becomes filled with detached fragments during the first stage, and with further drawdown during the second stage, these fragments become smaller. The first stage of the process is characterized by properties obtained from laboratory tests (such as tensile, triaxial and thick-walled cylinder) and assessed by calibrated continuum-based sand-prediction models, but the second stage of the process is difficult to characterize and assess quantitatively. The second stage has been assessed via empirical equations linking the rock strength degradation to production conditions (Xiao and Vaziri, 2011). A long-term goal of the present work is to quantify the entire rock strength degradation process by employing a bonded-particle model (BPM, Potyondy and Cundall (2004); Potyondy [2015]) in which the relevant grain-scale processes are modeled directly so that the rock strength degradation becomes an emergent property of the model arising from the microstructural interactions of the grains and cement.|","Document Type

Understanding the geomechanical and petrophysical properties of the rock materials from these layers is of much interest for CO2 storage, salt water disposal, and injection induced seismicity problems. In this paper, we present some results of a geomechanical characterization effort to determine the rock mechanical properties of the Arbuckle Group and its bounding formations. Static and dynamic elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio, shear strength, friction coefficient, and cohesion have been measured. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and Mohr-Coulomb failure envelop also have been estimated for every tested specimen. In addition, mechanical anisotropy of the rocks has been evaluated using both dynamic and static laboratory measurements. Furthermore, natural fracture properties have been measured under triaxial conditions. The characterizations of the rock mechanical properties of the Arbuckle group provide valuable data for ongoing numerical modeling of CO2 storage and seismicity in Oklahoma.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Arbuckle group is a major geological formation in the midcontinent of the United States that underlies several important petroleum producing zones such as West Mayfield in Anadarko basin, Wilburton in Arkoma basin and Cottonwood Creek in Ardmore basin (Fritz et al., 2013). In the state of the Oklahoma, the Arbuckle group serves as the primary saltwater disposal zone. According to Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), from 2010 to 2013, 14.47%-20.86% of SWD wells were completed in the Arbuckle group, and received 51.74% to 61.94% of the injected water volume (Murray, 2014). Understanding the rock and fracture properties of the Arbuckle geological formation would be beneficial to the well safety designs, and moreover, would provide reliable parameters for numerical modeling of production and seismicity. However, the literature contains very little to no data on the geomechanical properties of this important formation. Therefore, a laboratory geomechanical and petrophysical characterization program was developed to determine the much needed rock properties. Because actual core is not available, we used a block of the Arbuckle formation collected from outcrops in the Arbuckle Mountains in south-central Oklahoma along the I-35 in north of Carter County (34°22”6’, <U+2212>97°8’45”), as shown in Fig. 1, where the rock was not highly weathered and resembled the actual cores reserved in the Oklahoma Petroleum Information Center (OPIC) (Morgan, 2015). A series of experiments have been carried out on eighteen specimens extracted from the block to measure various rock and fracture properties.|","Document Type

The process reactivates pre-existing fractures, making them slip and dilate using fluid pressures below the minimum principal stress resulting in increased permeability. It can also cause fracture propagation in the shear and tensile modes creating secondary cracks. Control and optimization of shear stimulation can be achieved by studying how fracture permeability evolves with shear slip and dilation. However, most experimental studies that have considered fracture slip and permeability evolution have used force-driven shear tests or have manually displaced the specimens to represent fracture slip. A few studies have considered fluid injection-driven slip but only using saw-cut smooth joints. In this work, we have conducted shear slip test by water injection on rough fractures. Water was injected into a granite sample containing a single tensile rough fracture to induce shear slip under triaxial conditions. Flow rate during shear slip was measured to investigate fractures’ permeability evolution. In addition, the effects of confining pressure, differential stress, and injection pressure on stress-dependent permeability of the granite fractures were characterized. We tested three separate samples using different methods. Non-shear flow tests were conducted on a fractured Sierra White granite sample (SW #1) under both hydrostatic and triaxial conditions to characterize stress-dependent fracture permeability. We observed a linear relationship between flow rate and injection pressure, and an exponential relationship between flow rate and confining pressure. In addition, fluid injection-driven shear tests were performed on fractured samples SW #2 and SW #3 using constant stress mode and constant displacement mode, respectively. Shear rates observed during the constant stress test were <U+02DC>10<U+2212>3 m/s and yielded up to 3 orders of magnitude increases in flow rate while the constant displacement mode caused <U+02DC>10<U+2212>5 m/s sliding rate and 20 times increase in flow rate through the fracture. Furthermore, permeability evolution during injection-driven shearing tends to linearly evolve with the shear slip and dilation. The irreversible behavior of shear slip was found to explain the permeability hysteresis during shear sliding.
1. INTRODUCTION
Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) represent enormous renewable energy reserves (Tester et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2012). Field experiments have been carried out at sites such as Newberry, Desert Peak, Fenton Hill, Soultz-sous-Foretz and Rosemanowes. The primary objective of these field demonstrations has been to create flow paths through basement rock to facilitate heat transfer. Various stimulation mechanisms have been tested at these sites depending on the geology of the host rock, fault structures, natural fractures etc. Shear slip (Pine and Batchelor, 1984; Willis-Richards et al., 1996; Baria et al., 1999; Rahman et al., 2002; Nygren and Ghassemi, 2005; Cheng and Ghassemi, 2016) and the propagation of natural fractures are important mechanisms of permeability enhancement in EGS reservoirs (Min et al., 2010; Ghassemi, 2011; Huang et al., 2013; Jung, 2013; McClure and Horne, 2013; Kamali and Ghassemi, 2016). Often, crystalline basement rocks have pre-existing sealed fracture networks that are activated prior to the creation of new fractures since the sealing material is usually much weaker than the surrounding rock. The objective of shear stimulation is to create a stimulated volume with increased permeability to circulate large volumes of water. This is carried out at pressures below the minimum principle stress to avoid excessive fracture growth and large surface area. Fractures that are sheared tend to self-prop due to asperities.|","Document Type

Elements were mapped at the indentation sites using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The reduced elastic modulus, Er, hardness, H, and contact creep modulus, C were similar to those reported previously for source rocks from the US, except that the Vaca Muerta shale had a population of indentations with very low Er, H and C. High H was usually associated with pyrite, dolomite, calcite or quartz inclusions; the lowest values (H < 0.1 GPa) were found at sites within the clay matrix in oil-window samples, possibly owing to the presence of organic material. We could not use EDX to verify this conjecture because the measurement sensitivity for C is low. Volumetric averaging of elastic and contact creep moduli from indentation tests gave values consistent with short-term triaxial tests on inch-scale shale samples, but these values were inconsistent with those measured in the lab over longer durations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Recent technological advances such as horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing have greatly increased the economic importance of source rocks by allowing hydrocarbon production from ultra-low permeability shale reservoirs, but these processes also require better knowledge of mechanical properties. In particular, characterization of rock heterogeneity, anisotropy, and creep is needed to optimize resource utilization (Sone and Zoback, 2010, 2011, 2013a, b; Ambrose, 2014; Su et al., 2014; Abedi et al., 2016ab; Slim, 2016; Yang and Zoback, 2016). The effect of organic matter on mechanical properties also needs to be understood (Zargari et al., 2013, Wilkinson et al., 2015, Slim, 2016). Nano-indentation tests provide a convenient and quick way to characterize mechanical heterogeneity, using only small sample volumes. Results for these tests may also be useful in assessing the time-dependent penetration of hard proppant particles into the rock, a process that could reduce the transmissivity of the hydrofractures (Abedi et al., 2016ab, Slim, 2016; Alramahi and Sundberg, 2012, Zhang et al., 2015).|","Document Type

Y., Cairo University| Al-Mahallawy, M., Raw Materials Processing Laboratory","|ABSTRACT: The Nile sediments are characterized by its unique behavior where silt size particles exhibit significant plasticity. Cohesive Nile Sediments are collected and resedimented in two different forms of consolidometers. The paper presents a standardized process of resedimenting the silty clay in the laboratory. This research aims at characterizing the physical and mechanical properties of silty clay samples obtained from Mariouteya region in the Nile valley. The experimental program investigates the index properties of the sediments and grain size distribution using hydrometer and laser scattering particle analysis techniques. Results show how different classification approaches give different indications of sediment behavior. The compression behavior of the sediments is studied during resedimentation and by separate one-dimensional consolidation (oedometer) tests at pressures up to 3.2 MPa. The paper highlights and discusses the differences observed in compressibility during resedimentation and with conventional testing. The results show that the compressibility of Resedimented Nile Silty Clay (RNSC) at low pressures is within range measured from testing undisturbed samples from several locations along the Nile Valley and recorded in the literature. At high pressures the compression index decreases significantly and drops by 20% when pressure increases by an order of magnitude.
1. INTRODUCTION
Cohesive sediments have been transported by the Nile River to the river’s banks and off of the Mediterranean Egyptian shores for thousands of years. Plans for deep drilling activities in Offshore Egypt and mega projects (Factories, Power Plants, Highways, etc.) onshore require a good understanding of the geomechanical behavior and geotechnical properties of these sediments. The paper discusses the classification; and the compression behavior of two series from these sediments taken from the Mariouteya area in Giza, Egypt. The issue of classification presents a challenge because the paper shows that the Nile Silty Clay comprises relatively large size and irregularly shaped particles. The paper also considers the compression behavior of the sediments at pressures higher than 3 MPa, which is beyond the typical range of pressures considered by geotechnical engineers.
Casey (2014) demonstrated the possible confusion resulting from adopting different classification methods and different definitions for fine grained (cohesive) materials. Fine sediments are defined as clay according to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) depending on how the Atterberg Limits fall on the Casagrande Plasticity Chart, while according to another definition, when more than 50% of the particles are smaller than 0.002 mm.|","Document Type

Experimental study shows that an increase in the number and volume of pores for all rocks after freezing. However, the influence of nitrogen freezing on carbonate was not obvious because of intense mineral compaction and poor connectivity of pores. There was also an obvious reduction in Young’s modulus and unconfined compressive strength for coal. Especially, the average decrease ratio of Young’s modulus was approximately 0.43 and the average decrease ratio of unconfined compressive strength was 0.63 after and before freezing for all coal samples, which reflected strong freezing damage capability of liquid nitrogen. The mechanical properties also clearly decreased after liquid nitrogen treatment for sandstone samples. Unpronounced changes in shale, and carbonate correlate with tight mineral compaction. These conclusions reflect the characteristics variations of pore structure and mechanical properties were influenced directly by the type of rock during liquid nitrogen freezing. Also, it can provide some insights for avoid wellbore instability during hydraulic fracturing process with liquid nitrogen.
1. INTRODUCTION
Currently, hydraulic fracturing has become a common practice in the exploitation of low-permeability hydrocarbon reservoirs. However, large-scale hydraulic fracturing generally consumes a large amount of water and show some drawbacks such as mineral swelling in clay-rich formation and block oil and gas flow path, thus stimulation effectiveness and production is heavily affected [1-3]. Meanwhile, the consume on water during fracturing is vast and most of water can be lost, the residual fracturing fluids with chemicals trapped in formations sometimes have the potential to contaminate groundwater, thus hydraulic fracturing technology is strictly prohibited by some states in U.S.A. and a few European countries [4,5]. Accordingly, the application of water-less fracturing fluids like liquid nitrogen (LN2) is proposed for its great advantages of formation protection, less water demand and environmental impacts.|","Document Type

The tangential component Rt shows a dependency on the incoming direction, where the coefficient increases slightly with the increase in the angle. The two types of physical modeling for the falling sphere are introduced; mass point and rigid sphere. The both models with the contact system well explain the increase of the coefficient restitution Rt with increase of the incoming angle. The change in the rotational energy is only explained with the rigid body modeling. This paper provides very important data for the coefficient of restitution and a possible numerical method which can capture the behavior of boulder during the impact. An alternative fully three-dimensional numerical procedure for single block dynamics is presented, incorporating the contact model. This model applies to rockfall simulation to delimit the area where possible falling rock may exist.
1. ROCKFALL TRAJECTORY SIMULATION AND INPUT PARAMETERS
When assessing rockfall hazards, it is very important to be able to estimate travel distance of potential falling rock blocks and their velocities at a given point. These results affect protection measures against rockfall. Numerical simulation is often presented to study the characteristics at given sites. The numerical tools selected must be expected to produce all possible trajectories and end points to delimit the endangered zone on the area at the given sites. Estimations of them affect protection measures against rockfall. In such a numerical simulation, the most important input parameter controlling the outputs must be the coefficient of restitution. The reliability of input parameters used in numerical simulations must be examined.
When a falling rock block strikes the ground, the block does not bounce much. The block loses the kinetic energy at impact. This energy loss can be simply represented by the coefficient of restitution for mass point motion. The components of the coefficient are given by:|","Document Type

In a research project completed a few years ago, it was observed that characteristics of microseismicity around a longwall working panel were fairly consistent over the monitoring period until a heterogeneous zone with a relatively high coal strength was reached. The current research presented in this paper aims at achieving a better understanding of the effect of heterogeneity on microseismic activity in longwall coal mining. A microseismicity modelling approach which combines deterministic stress and failure analysis together with a stochastic fracture slip evaluation was used to simulate the evolution of microseismicity induced by the progressive face advance passing through a heterogeneous zone. The heterogeneous zone was taken into account by varying the material strength of the elements within the high strength zone and the fracture attributes within this zone. Results have shown that both the high rock strength of coal lithotype and low fracture intensity within this zone contribute to the decrease in seismic event counts, and that the increase in energy released results from the combined effects of increased stress drops and slipped fracture sizes when the high strength zone is approached.
1. INTRODUCTION
Underground mining activities are usually accompanied by microseismic events. Extraction of large volumes of rocks at depth brings about changes in stress conditions around mine openings and beyond. It has been widely accepted that microseismicity is predominantly caused by slip of pre-existing planes of weakness (e.g. fractures) and geological discontinuities (e.g. faults) (Stiller et al., 1983; Spottiswoode, 1984).
Seismic events are typically characterised by the magnitude of released energy, event counts, and the scaling of microseismic event magnitude. Energy released from a microseismic event is predominantly dependent on fracture size, stress drop along the fracture surface, and rock properties (Salamon, 1993). The stress drop is in turn affected by the prevailing stress conditions and rock properties.|","Document Type

The homogenous sandstone was the candidate of the control group. The macro fragmentation behaviors and their micro structures were acquired by the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Computed Tomography (CT) techniques. Results show that there are big difference of fragmentation behaviors between shale and sandstone. The efficiency of shale waterjet drilling is ultralow, which the erosion rate and the ultimate drilling depth cannot reach the half of those of sandstone. For the initial crushing hole, the compression-shear failure does not happen since the static pressure of waterjet is lower than the compression strength. However, the tensile fracture occurs and makes the rock spallation. In the state of the deep hole producing, the waterjet impinging force is not able to make the rock tensile or shear failure. Only the mineral particle erosion appears due to the high velocity erosion. This work provides the theoretical guide for improving the shale rock drilling efficiency by water jetting.
1. INTRODUCTION
Drilling through the Longmaxi shale formation is still time consuming and various approaches to achieve the cost efficient well plan have been attempted, involving the use of high pressure waterjet (Chen Mian et al., 2015; Li Gensheng et al., 2016). The drilling fluid is pumped through surface equipment or downhole intensifier to be high pressure waterjet. The success of waterjet technology requires more insight into the rock failure mechanisms under waterjet impinging. Until now, this topic still attracts much attention and many hypothesis and theoretical models were proposed to understand rock failure mechanics with the help of laboratory analysis, numerical simulation, and micro-structure analysis (X. Liu, Liu, & Ji, 2015; Y. Liu, Wei, & Ren, 2016; Lu, Huang, Liu, & Ao, 2015; Oh & Cho, 2016).
Previous studies have already demonstrated that the failure induced by waterjet is due to dynamic stress waves, static pressure loading, and abrasive erosion (Momber and Kovacevic 2012; Dehkhoda and Hood 2013; Liu, Wei et al. 2016). The degree of failure caused by each of the above depends on the rock properties and jet parameters. Compared to the metal material, the failure mechanics of rock material is more complicated due to its being a porous medium and complex mineral structures (Crow 1974). The apparent features of waterjet drilling have been confirmed through experimental works (Hashish 1988; Hood, Nordlund et al. 1990; Agus, Bortolussi et al. 1993). Particularly, the effects of waterjet parameters on drilling performance are fully recognized. For example, the key parameters that influence drilling performance involve the stand-off distance, jet pressure, jet impact angle and treating time. Based on the experimental studies, several semi-empirical models were proposed to predict the cutting depth and quality and had a good agreement with available data (Harris and Mellor 1974; Zeng and Kim 1996; Aydin, Karakurt et al. 2013; Oh and Cho 2016).|","Document Type

Following this, the effect of humidity on the tensile strength of coal bearing rocks, arkose sandstone and fine-grained sandstone from Mchenga underground coal mine, was studied aiming to clarify the mechanism of roof fall in the underground mines and proposing countermeasures against the roof falls. Rock samples from the mine were treated in varying humidity levels. Some specimens were oven dried at 80°C and a desiccant was used to attain low humidity. Moderate humidity was obtained using magnesium-nitrate-hexahydrate, high humidity was achieved by pure water and some specimens were vacuum saturated. Subsequently, Brazilian test was carried out to obtain indirect tensile strength along the sedimentary plane. For comparison, Neogene tuffaceous Kimachi sandstone from Japan was also tested, following the same conditions. It was confirmed that indirect tensile strength of the rocks decreased with increase in humidity. The sensitivity of indirect tensile strength to humidity for arkose and fine grained sandstones was 12% or 29% larger than that for Kimachi sandstone. The stronger sensitivity for Mchenga roof rocks would be because the rocks contain illite, whose strength is very sensitive to water, while Kimachi sandstone contains only less sensitive zeolite for clay minerals.
1. INTRODUCTION
Historically, mining has been imperative to human and social development, and the industry will continue to make investments that meet the increasing needs of society (ICMM, 2012). Moving from being an agrobased economy, Malawi has ventured into mining as its alternative economic driver towards the future. Coal offers an alternative for electrical energy in the country due to insufficient power generation from hydroelectric power stations along the Shire River in Malawi. This has put coal as the strategic commodity for the mining sector, focusing on the establishment of coal-fired power plants in the country. There are seven coalfields spread across the country, with four coalfields of bituminous coal in the Northern Region. Currently, four underground coal mining operations are running with additional two open pit mines in these coalfields.|","Document Type

P., University of Pittsburgh| Prioul, R., Schlumberger-Doll Research Center| Aidagulov, G., Schlumberger Dhahran Carbonate Research","|ABSTRACT: Carbonate-rich rocks, such as limestones, comprise commonly-encountered reservoir rocks in the oil and gas industry. This paper shows the impact of acidic fluid on the hydraulic fracture initiation through laboratory experimentation. The results show that, compared to water injection, acid injection results in more rapid initiation of the hydraulic fractures under so-called static fatigue or pressure-delay conditions wherein a certain pressure, insufficient to instantaneously generate a hydraulic fracture, is maintained until a hydraulic fracture grows. Acid injection also is shown to generate a dissolution cavity in the vicinity of the wellbore. The breakdown of the specimen is, in addition, observed to be explosive in the case of acid injection, probably due to the generation and the subsequent rapid expansion of carbon dioxide as a part of the dissolution reaction. Finally, the time to breakdown, or specimen lifetime, is shown to be related not only to the magnitude of the wellbore pressure, but also to the apparent permeability of the specimen. Altogether, the results indicate firstly that acid injection can be expected to improve the initiation of multiple hydraulic fractures within multistage hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells by decreasing the time required for initiation at subcritical wellbore pressures. The results also show that the current theoretical framework can capture the overall negative exponential relationship between the time to breakdown and the wellbore pressure, but it is insufficient to account for the secondary dependence on rock permeability.
1 INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracture initiation is classically considered to be governed by a binary criterion determining whether the wellbore pressure is sufficient to overcome the strength (or fracture toughness) of the rock. Either the pressure is sufficient to generate a hydraulic fracture, or it is not. Recent efforts have shown this to be an incomplete picture, that, in fact, the pressurization of a wellbore to a level insufficient for instantaneous initiation can instead lead to delayed initiation. This delayed initiation of hydraulic fractures was proposed based on theory by Bunger and Lu (2015). The existence of time-dependent hydraulic fracture initiation has been confirmed experimentally in the laboratory for sandstone and granite (Lu et al. 2015; Uwaifo 2015). At the same time, there are still some open questions. First, while the specimen lifetime, referring to the time between the start of the pressurization and the loss of specimen integrity due to hydraulic fracturing, has been shown to be dependent on wellbore pressure with an exponential, as predicted by the theory, the scatter in the data indicates that the pressure is probably not the only critical characteristic of the initiation. Second, all experiments to date have been conducted under conditions where no chemical interaction/reaction is expected between the rock and fluid. Here we present laboratory research aimed at this second issue, addressing the question of how the pressure-delay initiation phenomenon occurs in an acidic environment in a carbonate rock. There are reasons to expect that acidic fluid will have an impact. Past experimental analyses (e.g., Hill et al. 2007; Wu and Sharma 2015) show that the erosion by acid can weaken the strength of the rock matrix and make the rock easier to break. That idea inspires us to hypothesize that the acidic fluid injection will reduce the breakdown period and accelerate the speed of the delayed initiation. We evaluate experimentally, for the first time, the potential for hydrochloric acid to reduce the delayed initiation time for hydraulic fractures.|","Document Type

C., National University of Kaohsiung| Tsai, S. J., National Taiwan University","|ABSTRACT: A consequent slope comprises weak planes in the same dip direction along a slope face. This study investigated scale effects on the gravitational deformation of consequent slopes. A series of centrifuge model tests under simplified environmental conditions were performed. Particle image velocimetry was then adopted to evaluate the displacement distribution from the centrifuge model test results. Subsequently, the discrete element method (DEM) was used to execute simulations to provide detailed descriptions of the crack development and failure mechanisms associated with consequent slopes at different scales. The results of this study are summarized as follows. (1) The slopes exhibited similar deformation patterns in the centrifuge model tests. As the gravitational force increased, the magnitude of slope deformation increased significantly. (2) A modified dimensional relationship of material parameters was proposed for DEM simulation. According to this relationship, the simulated deformation patterns were in strong agreement with the actual deformations at various slope scales. (3) According to the DEM simulations, for the slopes with the same slope and weak plane angles, more cracks and displacements were generated in the higher slopes, leading to a greater sliding volume.
1. INTRODUCTION
A consequent slope, also called a dip slope, comprises weak planes in the same dip direction along a slope face. Because of the ease with which rock masses slide along the direction of the weak planes, translational sliding is the typical motion type associated with the failure of consequent slopes, and sudden and rapid sliding commonly induces severe disasters (Varnes 1978; Hung 2002; Wyllie and Mah 2004; Evans 2006; Weng et al. 2011). For example, buildings in the region of Ciao Ling and Chiufenerhshan in Taiwan were destroyed by landslides during the Chi-Chi earthquake in 1999. In 2010, the translational slide of a consequent slope near the Formosan Freeway in northern Taiwan buried a section of the freeway that was 190 m long and 35–43 m wide, killing four people. These landslides provided a reminder of the dangers associated with the development of consequent slopes. Therefore, identifying potential sliding mechanisms is imperative, and establishing an early warning system is essential (Hung 2010; Wang et al. 2013; Lo et al. 2015).|","physical model,  discrete element method, centrifuge,  dip slope,  consequent slope"

B., University of Minnesota","|ABSTRACT: This study investigates the elastic anatomy of fractures in rock using full wavefield measurements. In this spirit, a 3-step experimental campaign is pursued in a laboratory setting, namely: (1) full-field ultrasonic testing of the intact rock, (2) fracturing, and (3) ultrasonic interrogation of the fractured rock. Experiments are performed on a slab-like prismatic specimen of charcoal granite. The sample is illuminated under the plane stress condition, prior and posterior to fracturing, by a shear piezoelectric transducer at 10 and 30kHz. The (in-plane) velocity response of the rock is monitored via the 3D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer over a rectangular region in the fracture neighborhood. Upon proper signal processing, (i) the maps of elastic modulus in the specimen (before and after fracturing) is computed via elastography, exposing the geometric and elastic properties of the process zone; (ii) the fracture geometry is reconstructed, and (iii) profiles of shear and normal specific stiffness at the fracture interface are identified.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fracturing-induced damage in rock and its elastic attributes, namely: (i) the modified material properties in the damage zone and (ii) the heterogeneous contact condition at the fracture interface, are the subject of mounting interest in various aspects of geophysical science and technology including energy production from unconventional resources (gas/geothermal) (Baird et al. 2013, Verdon and Wustefeld 2013, Taron and Elsworth 2010), environmental protection (Place et al. 2014), seismology (McLaskey et al. 2012), and mining (Gu et al. 1993). The variation of elastic moduli in the damage zone may trigger aseismic slip along rock faults (Calo’ et al., 2011). Furthermore, such non-uniform stress distribution gives rise to a heterogeneous elastic contact at the boundary of fractures and faults, that is often parametrized in terms of a distributed (shear and normal) specific stiffness, relating the contact traction to the jump in displacements across the interface (Schoenberg, 1980). The interfacial stiffness - strongly correlated with the surface roughness, static pre-stress and material properties of the bulk rock (and pore/interfacial fluid) (Pyrak-Nolte and Morris 2000) - plays a critical role in the stability and strength of rock discontinuities, and controls the key characteristics of fracture networks in reservoirs. In particular, the inhomogeneous contact condition is responsible for the progressive failure along discontinuities that may occur well before the frictional resistance of the entire interface is surpassed (Hedayat et. al., 2014; Eberhardt et al., 2004). Moreover, the hydraulic properties e.g. fluid conductivity of subsurface discontinuities is directly connected to the elastic nature of their interface (Pyrak-Nolte and Nolte 2016). Therefore, a proper elastic representation of fractures in the continuum models of the subsurface may lead to better understanding of subterranean fluid flow e.g. through the fractured reservoirs, and thus, enhance the (gas/geothermal) reservoir prognosis (Pyrak-Nolte and Nolte 2016). On the other hand, the marriage between such “enriched” models of discontinuity and active seismic imaging tools (Pourahmadian et. al., 2015, 2016) opens a path forward for finding timely precursors of instability along rock faults. This work aims to decipher the elastic nature of fracturing in rock in a laboratory setting. In this spirit, a 3-step experimental campaign is designed by taking advantage of the 3D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV) that is capable of monitoring triaxial particle velocity, with frequencies up to 1MHz, over the surface of rock specimens with 0.1mm spatial resolution and O(nm) displacement accuracy. Full-field ultrasonic measurements are performed prior and posterior to fracturing the specimen which are then used to quantify (a) the variation of the sample’s elastic constants due to fracturing, and (b) the induced fracture geometry and its heterogeneous interfacial condition.|","Document Type

W.,","|ABSTRACT: The cracked chevron notched semi-circular bending (CCNSCB) method falls into a significant testing category of chevron notched specimens for measuring the mode I fracture toughness, of which the progressive fracture mechanism deserves to be further assessed. In this study, the discrete element method (DEM) is adopted to depict the fracture processes of the CCNSCB specimens considering different supporting spans and heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that the crack front of the CCNSCB specimen with any loading condition is prominently curved, which violates the straight-through crack propagation assumption and may induce some errors in the fracture toughness measurements. The peak force of the CCNSCB specimens evidently increase with decreased supporting span. For a relatively large span, the crack grows restrictively in the notched ligament, which conforms to the ideal assumption of the fracture process and contributes to an accurate measurement of the mode I fracture toughness. Thus, a large supporting span is suggested for the semi-circular bend tests. In addition, the tanglesome weak elements distribution in the heterogeneous specimen can disturb stress distribution, and the more heterogeneous specimen corresponds to the lower peak force. This study calls for more attention on how to accurately determine the fracture toughness via chevron notched samples.
1. Introduction
Rock fracture induced by various loadings is frequently encountered in engineering applications involving drilling, rock bursting, oil-well fracturing and tunneling, etc. These failure processes of rocks are affected by various fracture parameters, among which, rock fracture toughness, reflecting the capability of rocks to resist crack propagation, is regarded as a significant parameter. Depending on the suffered stress experienced by the crack, a crack grows with the superposition of three basic failure modes (Anderson, 2005). For engineering rocks, the mode I (the opening or tension mode) fracture is frequently encountered. Therefore, the studies on the mode I fracture toughness determination have attracted wide researches.|","heterogeneity,  DEM,  CCNSCB, Numerical investigation"

Lost circulation may have serious safety consequences and heavy financial costs in the form of losing mud fluid to the fractures, wellbore stability issues and losing rig time while dealing with the problem. Despite recent advances, lost circulation materials used in the field still have disadvantages such as plugging tools due to the large size of the particles, damaging production zones and failure to minimize lost circulation when heavy mud columns exists in the annulus. In this work, we introduce a new class of “Smart Lost Circulation Materials” to effectively seal the fractures and minimize lost circulation by increasing hoop stress. Our smart LCMs are made out of thermoset shape memory polymers which are activated upon exposure to the formation’s in situ temperature that causes expansion and acts as an effective seal for the fractures. The physical properties of our smart lost circulation materials prevent damage to production zones and tool plugging. In addition, the expansive property of the smart LCM provides compressional forces that strengthen the wellbore by artificially reducing the fracture gradient. We conducted a series of experiments using a HPHT particle-plugging apparatus (PPA) to measure the sealing efficiency of the smart LCMs. In addition, a fully coupled CFD-DEM model is developed to further study the effectiveness of various particle size distributions and the corresponding stress release to improve the design of this product.
1. INTRODUCTION
One of the problems in rotary drilling is lost circulation. In order to transport cuttings and cool the bit, drilling fluids are supposed to be circulated down to the bottomhole and come back to the surface (White, 1956). When lost circulation occurs, drilling fluids are lost. To stop further fluid loss, loss circulation materials (LCMs) have to be added to the mud. This kind of incidents may have a heavy financial and environmental burden, which justifies the high price of LCM products. It would also increase the high cost of nonproductive rig time that is very valuable (Whitfill and Hemphill, 2003). The US Department of Energy reported in 2010 that on average 10% to 20% of the cost of drilling high-pressure, high temperature wells is spent on mud losses. Above all, lost circulation can lead to mud levels falling, which can cause an underbalance pressure state of the well. In severe cases, it may lead to a kick or even a blowout (Arshad et al., 2014). Instances of lost circulation usually occur in cavernous, karst, highly permeable and naturally fractured formations (Al-Saba et al., 2014). If lost-circulation zones are anticipated, preventive measures should be taken by treating the mud with loss of circulation materials (LCMs) and preventive tests such as the formation integrity test should be performed to better define the mudweight window to limit the possibility of loss of circulation. Hence, lost circulation is a very important issue which has led to a lot research dedicated to minimize its negative impacts and the biggest breakthrough has been LCMs. They are designed to seal fractures and minimize mud loss. The seven categories of LCMs classified by Nygaard et al. (2014) are: fibrous, granular, flaky, acid/water soluble, mixture, high fluid loss LCM squeeze, swellable/hydratable LCM combinations and nanoparticles. Each material varies in its chemical properties, flexibility, shape and the way they seal the fracture.|","Document Type

R., University of Alberta","|ABSTRACT: In this paper we demonstrate our attempts to model fluid injection induced fault movement using the Cohesive Zone Method (CZM) within the framework of the Finite Element Method (FEM). We build a concept model with stress state similar to that of Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. In our concept model, a strike-slip fault is represented by a thin layer of cohesive elements. The constitutive equations of the cohesive elements are prescribed to represent the rheology of the fault. Our benchmark test with changing stress states shows that our approach can effectively model the stick-slip process of an earthquake. We further apply this method on a transient test with the injection/extraction histories similar to a hydraulic fracturing operation. The simulation results show that the increase in pore pressure due to fluid injection leads to the reduction of the fault’s shear strength which is represented using a damage factor D in our model. The fault’s slip rate is highest while the bonding between two sides of the fault plane is being broken down. After the bonding is completely broken, the fault will continue to slip but at a smoother and slower rate.
1. INTRODUCTION
In the past decade, researchers have suggested that fluids injected into the subsurface during reservoir stimulation operations may perturb the in-situ state of stress sufficiently to re-activate the motion on the nearby faults (Bachmann et al., 2012; Ellsworth, 2013; McGarr, 2014; Zang et al., 2014). The displacement along such faults, while small relative to major tectonic events, can produce swarms of small earthquakes and potentially results in property damage (Lei et al., 2008; Keranen et al., 2013). This issue has been brought to broader attention with the increasing application of enhanced hydrocarbon recovery via hydraulic fracturing in low permeability reservoirs with clusters of low magnitude earthquakes occurring near some of the shale oil/gas plays across North America (Davies et al., 2013; Holland, 2013; Schultz et al., 2015; Skoumal et al., 2015; Atkinson et al., 2016). A great deal of effort has been expended on the monitoring and characterization of these earthquake swarms by industry, regulators and academia. Semi-permanent broadband seismometers have been deployed in areas of interest to allow for more precise estimates of event locations, magnitudes and focal mechanisms (Schultz and Stern 2015; Wang et al., 2016). In some cases the induced events may be related to features in local geology (Rutledge et al., 2004; Schultz et al., 2016) or the stress regimes (Zoback and Hickman, 1982). Overall, there appears to be strong statistical evidence in some areas for a link between reservoir stimulation and induced seismicity.|","Document Type

For consideration of compaction-drive in the sequential coupling between fluid flow and geomechanics, we developed and applied a new alternative approach of linking volumetric strain to the fluid mass balance through a correction of rock compressibility in the fluid flow simulator. Using this approach, we conducted model simulations for understanding the impact of porosity change on deformation and gas production, including sensitivity studies with regard to material properties and operation parameters for the optimization of gas production. The model simulations showed that the reservoir compaction can increase or decrease the gas recovery depending on the specific porosity and the permeability changes in the reservoir. This result shows that the interaction between fluid flow and geomechanics should be considered for optimal reservoir management and TOUGH-FLAC with the implemented coupling approach can be an effective tool for such analysis.
1. INTRODUCTION
Biogenic gases have become increasingly attractive targets of oil and gas exploration and production activities in the worldwide. However, production of the gases from poorly consolidated or unconsolidated soft sediments in shallow reservoirs can be technically challenging operations because of depletion-induced reservoir compaction. Fluid production from such reservoirs and associated pressure drop may cause reservoir compaction and consequent surface subsidence (Settari, 2002), potentially resulting in surface facility damage (Mayunga, 1969), fault reactivation (Segall, 1989, Odonne et al., 1999), or wellbore instability (Bruno, 1992, Rutqvist et al., 2012). Pore collapse of weak sediments during compaction could drastically degrade reservoir quality by significantly reducing porosity and permeability. Meanwhile, the reservoir compaction can maintain reservoir pressure being an important driving mechanism enhancing oil and gas production (compaction-drive). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of and impact of reservoir compaction is essential for reservoir management and risk control. However, such interaction between fluid flow and geomechanics may not be properly handled with conventional reservoir simulators where compaction is calculated as a function of pore pressure only, while neglecting stress changes due to deformation.|","Document Type

This paper presents the results of a series of numerical analyses performed to investigate HW sloughage potential in open stope underground mines. Hybrid DFN-3DEC models were developed to assess the sloughage zone that can form in a stope hanging wall that consists of a weak and highly fractured rock mass quality. The influence of leaving 1 m and 2 m of ore-skin of higher rock mass quality, unmined along the weak hanging wall zone, on the potential hanging wall sloughage was investigated. The main advantages of hybrid DFN-3DEC models for assessment of hangingwall sloughage potential are their capacity to represent the structural complexity of the rock masses (through the DFN model) and to address the effect of confining stresses on the unravelling process.
1. INTRODUCTION
Underground open stoping is a popular bulk underground mining method usually selected for its safe non-entry stopes and for the relatively high production rates that can be achieved using larger excavations and mechanized equipment. Steeply dipping tabular ore-bodies with medium to narrow width are ideal for open stope mining. The ore-body is generally divided into a series of regularly shaped, large open stopes, which are extracted in sequence. In Canada, a significant portion of underground metal mines production rely on open stope mining.
In this method, the stopes remain generally unsupported during the mining process. This can result in instability of stope walls that can lead to significant dilution rates. Field observations show that one of the main sources of unplanned ore dilution in open stoping underground mines is hangingwall sloughage (Ran, 2002, Saeedi et al., 2010, Henning and S. Mitri, 2008). Hangingwall sloughage is related to the stress relaxation process that occurs as the volume of rock that constitutes the stope is being extracted. The stope extraction leads to the redistribution of in-situ stresses around the excavation such as the minor principal stress at the face is lowered to zero. In countries like Canada, where the minimum principal stress is nearly vertical, the redistribution of the in-situ stresses, combined with progressive mining along the ore body strike will cause the stope hanging wall (HW) and footwall (FW) to be in a relaxed stress state, with no more confining stress. Hence, the rock blocks located within the relaxation zone become more susceptible to the influence of gravity and will start to unravel. At this point, the gravitational forces are more important for the stope stability than the load bearing capacity of the rock mass, causing the structural geometry of the rock mass and the shear strength of the discontinuities to be the major controlling parameters for the HW sloughage.|","Document Type

However, its capacity and service life are significantly reduced if the metallic body is subjected to corrosion. In some hard rock mines in the US, highly corrosive ground conditions exist and the bolts corrode within a few months after installation. To provide mining industry a corrosion resistant expandable bolt, Keystone Mining Services, LLC (KMS) analyzed corroded bolt samples, identified root causes, evaluated properties of various coating materials, and developed a new Python M3TM rock bolt that is protected with an innovative PyFlexU2TM coating. The Python M3TM bolt features improved steel chemistry for reliable performance and modified profile for better inflation, surface preparation, and coating application. With a flexible, adhesive, and highly corrosion-resistant undercoat, and a very hard sacrificial topcoat, the PyFlexU2TM coating system provides the Python M3TM a superior protection against chemical corrosion and physical scratch damage. The product has been tested in the most challenging conditions including extreme laboratory corrosion tests and field borehole scratch insertion tests. With demonstrated performance, the product has been embraced by hard rock mines in the US. This paper identifies the root causes of the bolt corrosion, briefs analysis process, and details laboratory and underground test results on the Python M3TM rock bolt coated with PyFlexU2TM.
1. INTRODUCTION
Expandable rock bolts have been widely used for rock reinforcements, particularly in underground hard rock mines, for over 35 years due to low cost, easy installation, effectiveness, and favorable deformability in shear mode. An expandable rock bolt, such as Python, is made of a steel tube that is folded into an omega-shape in the cross section (Fig. 1). During installation, the bolt is inserted into a borehole and inflated with high pressure water. The inflated tube generates frictional full-length anchorage due to contact stress and mechanical interlock at the bolt-rock interface.|","Document Type

While this system has been used for many years, it results in a stiff support system that is unable to yield with the squeezing ground and takes hours of curing to reach full strength. Noticing a void in this ground support technique, Jennmar Corporation, Inc. and its subsidiary Keystone Mining Services, LLC (KMS) developed and fine-tuned the Multiple Point Anchor (MPA) hollow core yielding bolt with the injectable J-LokP resin system. The MPA is a self-drilling hollow core rock bolt designed to yield statically up to 20% before bolt failure. The MPA can also yield dynamically in high stress zone where sudden rock bursts may occur. The injectable J-LokP resin system consists of a limestone filled two-component pumpable polyester resin, J-LokP, and a specialized J-LokP pump. When used with the MPA, J-LokP is injected into the bolt through the use of a grout swivel mounted on the drill head. This allows the miner to install and anchor the bolt remotely reducing his exposure to hazards. Full anchorage of the MPA installed with J-LokP is typically obtained in less than 5 minutes. With demonstrated improvements to the safety of the miners and reduced cycle times, these products have been greatly welcomed by hard rock mines in the United States and Canada.

High-stress and squeezing ground conditions are one of the greatest challenges to ground control in the mining industry. With increasing mining depths and scale, these conditions are becoming more and more prevalent requiring the development of specialized ground support systems. Recently, Jennmar Corporation, Inc. and its subsidiary company Keystone Mining Services, LLC (KMS) completed extensive research and testing on the Multiple Point Anchor (MPA) hollow core yielding bolt with the injectable J-LokP resin system to control these difficult conditions. The system is specifically designed to allow for immediate rock support with a long term bolt. Normally these new systems become too complex or impractical for the end user.

UCS results obtained from lab testing are used in various petroleum geomechanical workflows for calibrating log-based UCS estimations during drillability, mud-weight window selection, optimum well trajectory selection, and hydraulic fracture design. ASTM or ISRM standards prescribe high-quality, intact right circular cylindrical sample core plugs, with a diameter covering 10 grains or more, and a length (L) to diameter (D) ratio (L/D) of 2.0 to 2.5. However, L/D ratio of the core samples obtained from wireline rotary sidewall coring or shale or fragile samples rarely meet these specifications. The current review work shows that the UCS increased rapidly as soon as L/D < 1 due to an absence of a shear plane that causes failure in compression testing. For L/D 1.0-1.5 the decrease in UCS is greatest, for L/D 1.5-2.0 the decrease is moderate. Further, the data analysis shows how L/D correction can be obtained for any formation type in any test plan.
1. INTRODUCTION
Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) is the simplest, least-expensive, most commonly used and understood parameter by professionals in geomechanics, formation evaluation, reservoir characterization, drilling, completion, and the hydraulic fracture community. UCS results obtained from lab testing are used in various petroleum geomechanical workflows for calibrating log-based UCS estimation. The calibrated log of UCS is then used in rate of penetration or drillability estimation, mud-weight window selection for casing depth selection, optimum well trajectory selection for most stable and productive wells, and custom design of hydraulic fracturing.
1.1. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS)
UCS is the ultimate strength of a rock formation sustained under ideal conditions and one-dimensional compressive loading. If the load applied is under tension or shear, the ultimate strength is characterized as tensile or shear strength. Under compressive loading, failure usually occurs along a shear plane that is inclined approximately 30° to 50° from the loading direction. UCS measured in a laboratory is highly variable in nature due to mineral, mechanical and microstructural components and the way it is measured by people, the load frame, and the surrounding conditions. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) or The International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) or a similar standard in cement and concrete industry prescribe a guideline to follow during the process. However, deviations always occur; sometimes beyond the control of people, their expertise, and the heterogeneous nature of rocks type. For example, depending upon the standard deviations obtained in the laboratory, there is a suggested procedure to perform 8 to 10 repeat tests before reporting. Because of the limited resources of sample availability, difficulty in sample preparation, time and cost at hand, many times only one or a few tests are done.|","Document Type

Kinematic analysis with DIPS 5.1 software found the hanging wall to be threatened mostly by wedge failure, with less potential for planar and toppling failures.
1. INTRODUCTION
Pit slope failure can impact safety of personnel and equipment, ultimately affecting profitability of mining operations. While mining activities such as drilling, blasting and material excavation can alter the integrity of slopes and cause them to fail, conditions including pit stress distribution, presence of geologic structures and groundwater, rockmass strength and pit geometry can be major contributing factors to slope failures in mining operations. Stability of rock slopes is often significantly influenced by geologic structures (bedding planes, joints and faults) of the rock in which the slope is located.
Rock slope stability analysis is routinely performed for assessing safe and functional design of excavated slopes (such as open pit mines, road cuts, etc.) and/or equilibrium conditions of natural slopes. The analysis is usually conducted to determine rock slope stability conditions, investigate potential failure mechanisms, determine slope sensitivity to different triggering mechanisms and design optimal slopes with regards to safety, reliability and economics (Eberhardt, 2003). Paul and Freiberg, 2006 state that geological investigation of rock slope is an important exercise for stability of slopes and safety of personnel. This study thus aimed to assess the stability of open pit slope at Goldfields Ghana Limited located at Tarkwa in the Western Region of Ghana.|","Document Type

However, the effects of imbibition on fracture conductivity are still unclear. In this paper, the fracture conductivity and imbibition experiments are conducted, and the correlativity between fracturing fluid imbibition and fracture conductivity damage is analyzed to explore the micro mechanism. The study finds out that fracturing fluid imbibition can obviously reduce fracture conductivity, and the conductivity damage degree of shale is much higher than that of conventional reservoir. After fracturing fluid entering shale, the interaction between shale and fracturing fluids is so strong as to cause the strength weakness and creep aggravation, which results in proppant embedment and fracture conductivity reduction. The interaction strength is not related to imbibition rate, but it is positively correlated with driving force coefficient. The research is significant for a deep recognition on interaction between fracturing fluid and shale.
1. INTRODUCTION
Multistage fracturing is the most important technology to form massive complicated fracture network in shale reservoirs and achieve efficient exploitation of shale gas. However, the efficient exploitation not only depends on the fracture network, but also needs to keep sufficient conductivity of artificial fracture network (Novlesky et al., 2011). The phenomena that the proppant is seriously imbedded into fracture surface can obviously reduce the artificial fracture conductivity and the shale gas production (Pritz et al., 2011).
The fracture conductivity has received Considerable attention. However, there are few researches on the influences of fracturing fluid imbibition on fracture conductivity. Field observations indicate that more than 70% of fracturing fluid are detained in shale formation (Makhanov et al., 2014). It is generally recognized that the fracturing fluids imbibition into matrix pores is the key factor to result in low flowback efficiency. To a large extent, the interaction between fracturing fluid and shale is caused by imbibition, which both reduces the shale strength and proppant embedment (Zhou et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015).|","Document Type

H., The University of Oklahoma| Ghassemi, A., The University of Oklahoma| Hachan, J., The University of Oklahoma","|ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the effects of fluid injection and heat extraction on pressure and temperature diffusion processes, and fracture/matrix deformation in an enhanced geothermal reservoir. The geometry of a single linear fracture in a 2D permeable rock matrix is chosen. Using an instantaneous point source solution, expressions are derived for the pore-pressure diffusion in the fracture and the reservoir. Moreover, heat transport within the fracture includes advection and conduction from the fracture walls, while heat transport in the reservoir includes only conduction and is assumed one dimensional and perpendicular to the fracture. Based on these assumptions, a Green’s function approach is used to find the two-dimensional solution for the pressure and temperature diffusion. A numerical example illustrates the time-dependent variation of each of the two variables; fluid pressure and temperature and their sensitivity to the fracture/formation properties. The resulting solutions can be used, amongst others, to study wellbore stability and in fracture propagation models to simulate secondary fracture propagation from the main fracture.
1. INTRODUCTION
The geothermal energy harnessed from hydrothermal and Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) proves to be important for humankind. It is clean, sustainable and economical. These Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are usually characterized with predominantly dry, impermeable rock with some pre-existing fractures. Additional fracturing is needed to improve the reservoir permeability through creation of a fracture network. Figure 1 shows the heat injection/extraction approach. The approach involves the drilling of two wells, one for injection and another one for extraction. Cold water is injected into the HDR system at sufficient pressures and is later extracted at much higher temperatures and transported to a power plant. The injection/ extraction (Fig.1) processes lead to the perturbation of in-situ stresses and pore pressures.
On the other hand, the cooling/heating of the reservoir rock introduces thermal effects that have proven to directly impact on the fracture and matrix deformation (Cheng et al., 2001), (Ghassemi et al., 2008), (Tarasovs and Ghassemi, 2011), (Tarasovs and Ghassemi, 2012). Therefore, the response of fractures to injection and extraction operation is required for a better design and management of the reservoir. Studies have also shown that secondary fractures are very likely to stem from pre-existing or main fractures due to cooling without considering the role of water pressure. Hence, the study of fracture initiation and propagation and the reservoir matrix deformation should incorporate an analysis of both the pore pressure and temperature in the system and their evolution through time. These functions should be considered when analyzing problems such of wellbore stability and induced seismicity.|","Document Type

Therefore, natural fracturing and fracture network formation can occur in various context such as tectonic loading, erosion, or compaction disequilibrium due to significant sedimentation rate. During sedimentation, buried rocks are subjected to an increase in vertical stress that leads to a decrease of porosity and a significant rise in pore pressure. In present work, the case of fractures induced by significant sedimentation rate is studied using both analytical and numerical methods. The focus is put on a synthetic geological structure containing a caprock and a reservoir that are overpressured by a vertical mechanical load. For the numerical simulations, finite element modeling and cohesive model with damage are used. The context of poro-mechanics is considered to build an original analytical solution. The effect of several parameters is studied and the analysis lead to a fracturing criterion for sedimentation context. |1. INTRODUCTION |Basin modeling is commonly used to provide a better understanding of a sedimentary basin history and of its actual state. The actual state of a sedimentary basin in terms of pressure, fluid content, stress state and rock properties is the result of its complete history. Many processes are involved in a basin history such as sedimentation, erosion or tectonics. This phenomenon are known to induce change in pressures and stresses and possibly natural fracturing. Natural fracturing can therefore significantly modify rock transfer properties (Twenhofen, 1950; Schneider et al., 1999). The knowledge of fracturing processes enhances the description of overpressure history, which is a key issue to predict actual overpressures and the fluid content of the underground. Deep natural fracturing has been widely studied since the introduction of the effective stress concept by Terzaghi, (1936) and the concept of poroelasticity by Biot, (1941) to explain tensile stress at very high depth. According to these concepts fractures are initiated when the pore pressure and the total stress are such that a positive and significant enough effective stress locally appear. This phenomena is called natural hydraulic fracturing (Audet et al., 1992; Mourges R. et al., 2011). Lorenz and Finley, (1991) and Lorenz et al., (1991) have shown that it is not possible to initiate fractures in homogeneous poroelastic formation in regional context. Furthermore previous references showed that natural fractures are initiated in the vicinity of natural defaults in the rock which has been confirmed through numerical poroelastic modeling of natural facture propagation in the context of high sedimentation rate (Ouraga et al., 2016).|","Document Type

G., University of Utah","|ABSTRACT: A finite element based approach to design of foundations on jointed rock is described. Focus is on computation of load-settlement (P-<U+03B4>) plots that provide important design guidance in the form of foundation stiffness K where <U+03A1>=<U+039A><U+03B4>. While bearing capacity is an ambiguous term that may imply load or settlement, foundation stiffness relates to both. Combinations of joint properties and geometry with properties of intact rock between joints are endless, so site-specific analysis is highly desirable. However, tabulation of jointed rock foundation stiffness for selected combinations of three-joint set geometries can provide useful guidance during preliminary design stages. Examples illustrate application of the approach using tabulated data.
1. INTRODUCTION
Design of foundations on soil is evidently based on a legacy of limiting equilibrium analyses of strip footings (plane strain) from an era of pre-digital computer days. Collapse loads based slipline solutions to rigid-ideally plastic problems used with a judicious factor of safety or one specified by building codes are the norm. Such solutions are upper bound solutions. Lower bound estimates perhaps would be more useful and indeed much effort has been expended in developing such bounds (Chen and Han 1988, Chen 2008). However, estimates of collapse loads are silent on the critical question of settlement. To be sure, elasticity theory is also used in foundation analysis (Selvaduari and Davis 1996). While the literature concerning foundations on soils is enormous, the literature on rock foundations is sparse, indeed, and moreover tends to follow the soil mechanics tradition of focusing on collapse loads (Goodman 1980, Wyllie 1999, Kulhawy 2005).
A finite element based design approach uses current technology to obtain estimates of load and settlement quickly and accurately subject to the quality of available site data. A most important feature of such an approach is a technically sound accounting of joints at the site of interest. An equivalent properties computation that allows joint and intact rock between joints to yield as evolution of the stress field occurs under load meets this requirement (Pariseau 1999). Viability of the approach is demonstrated first in comparison with analytical solution to load-settlement of a strip footing without joints. The effect of joints on this solution is presented next. Example problems follow. A brief summary concludes this contribution.|","Document Type

Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) technologies enhance geothermal resources in the hot dry rock (HDR) through fracture operations, usually through hydro-shearing. Large scale deployment of geothermal power production requires the demonstration of successful EGS projects extracting heat from reservoirs constituting a variety of geological conditions. In this part, numerical models are very important to show how geothermal power plant operations can be less risky and safer. Owing the fact that, some major challenges in these operations are interaction between shear and tensile fractures with natural faults. These interactions can be seen in two different cases, either these faults are badly oriented or these faults are fill in pore fluids or gases which are mainly high pressure. Fluids and gases are important on account for because of the fact that these pore fluids can over whelmed the injection pressure and cause well blow out. Furthermore, to prevent these operational hazards, we use field data and analysis in combination with experimental tests and numerical/analytical models with finite element method software such as COMSOL Multiphysics. Further work will be required for improving enhanced geothermal production by optimizing hydro-shearing practices.
1. INTRODUCTION
Geothermal energy resources have been used by mankind in some form for thousands of years. Depending on the temperature of the resource, it may be used for power production, supply of heat or a combination of both. In order to expand the potential for geothermal power production, focus should be made on facilitating the deployment of the Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) technology. In this work, we investigate the role of temperature of injecting or pore fluids and gases for thermal stressing in rock texture and check these influences on numerical models.
To predict the fracture propagation system in geothermal reservoirs, numerical models should be able to show the temperature effects. This effect can cause small thermal expansions and generate thermal stresses. Also, thermal stress experiments have shown that cooling contraction produces a greater abundance of fractures in comparison with thermal expansion. Within an overall tensile cooling regime Mode, I crack propagate in small increments to make generally longer fractures. Finally, in our models we show how we can predict this temperature dependent fracture propagation system which is an additional propagation parameter in the system. Hydraulic fracturing (HF) is one of the best techniques employed in oil and gas reservoirs to improve the turnover of production. In this phenomenon a highly pressurized fluid is pumped into a borehole resulting in creation of cracks which will be used to reach in stored resources in hard layers reported by Dong e.g. Primary models of HF have assumed a neat crack evolving in a continuous medium which has been proved to be over idealized as nearly all reservoirs are full of faults affecting this phenomenon. The existence of faults – especially very large ones – could far change the crack propagation mechanisms; different behaviors of penetration, arrest, diversion and offset could be distinguished in case intersection takes place by Zhang e.g. Multiple parameters will be important in final behavior of the intersecting cracks; fluid viscosity, angle between interfaces, crack lengths, friction coefficient and far field stresses. But these parameters were not considered in these set of presenting models. HF in medias with initial faults has been studied by different methods. Akulich and Zvyagain have studied interaction between HF crack and natural fractures using a BEM procedure, where viscosity effects have been taken into account. Simulation of hydraulic fracture propagation near a natural fracture using virtual multidimensional internal bonds is represented by Zhang and Ghassemi. Zhang et al. has studied layered medium where the effects of different sequences of soft and stiff layers has been investigated. Gudmunsson and Brenner have performed similar study with more than two layers taken into account.|","Document Type

In this paper, the authors conduct the test of mineral composition and SEM to understand the reservoir characteristics. The diffusion experiments are conducted on crushed samples, and a new method is proposed to differentiate between matrix and microfractures by using diffusion data. A large amount of salt ions exit in shale pores and can diffuse into fracturing fluids after fracturing operations. To a great extent, ion diffusion rate is determined by the development of microfractures. The crushed samples with smaller grain diameter contain have lower diffusion rate due to the low probability of microfractures development. When the grain diameter is lower than critical value, the crushed samples cannot contain microfractures. As for Longmaxi formation sample, the fracture-matrix boundary is about 80mesh.The research contributes to understanding the reservoir characteristics and salinity profiles of gas shale.
1. INTRODUCTION
The field observations show that the salinity of recovered water is generally high. What’s more, the salinity increases continuously over time and even exceeds 10%. It should be noted that the salinity of slick water is about 0.1%. The researchers tend to attribute this observation to the salt ions diffusion into fracturing fluids (Wang et al., 2016).
The salt ions concentration and type in recovered water can act as the indicator to evaluate the development of fracture network. Unlike primary fractures, the secondary fractures are induced fractures that are covered by connate water film. The connate water film can mixes easily with fracturing fluids to increase the salinity of fracturing fluids (Woodroof et al., 2003). The secondary fractures with smaller aperture size tend to forms high exposure area that can enhance the ion diffusion capacity. In addition, the ion type in secondary fractures is different from that in primary fractures (Gdanski et al., 2007). The study found that Ba2+ exits in secondary fractures and the development of microfractures are evaluated based on the concentration of Ba2+ (Agrawal and Sharma, 2013).|","Document Type

An ideal case of a Griffith crack propagating in an ideal material has been calculated by Dr. Joseph Walsh. This ideal case is used to estimate stepwise or continuous fracture propagation for different fracture fluids for a rock with stiffness and strength simulating a shale at a depth of about 6000 feet. More compressible fluids such as CO2 and nitrogen foam show larger stepwise propagation with steps of possibly tens of feet. Indeed rocks are not ‘ideal’ materials, nor are insitu stress magnitudes uniform and continuous. Nevertheless, the calculations here present interesting perceptions of the role of the compressibility of fracture fluids on hydraulic fracture propagation.
Introduction: Hydraulic fracturing for oil/gas well stimulation involves fluid driven fractures that propagate under high compressive insitu stresses. The process is particularly complex in heterogeneous and discontinuous rock formations such as the shales. Because of the great importance of the problem, much research has been performed to model such fracture propagation. In the research, practitioners have attributed fluctuations in treatment records -- with varying amplitudes and frequencies -- as indicative of local or larger scale heterogeneity and consequent propagation complexity. However, in considering different time scales in the fracture propagation, other complexities exist with which we are familiar. For example, the so-called dry zone near the fracture tip is a classic situation where the fracture may grow faster than the fracture fluid can progress. After the fracture is arrested, the fracture fluid can partially or completely ”catch up” with the fracture tip, and another discrete propagation step may occur.
This becomes a particularly interesting phenomenon when considered in conjunction with a fracture approaching a discontinuity.
Realizing that fracture fluid and system compressibilities have similar, unexploited effects when considering the repetitive incremental propagation of a hydraulically generated fracture, this paper “steps back” from the complicated scenario as above and considers an ideal case for a Griffith crack propagating. From such ideal calculations, an estimate can be made of the fracture growth step length that might occur. Different treating fluids such as water, CO2, and a N2 foam are considered in these calculations. For this idealized case, step lengths vary from zero to tens of feet for different in situ stress environments, formation properties and treatment fluid characteristics. The relevance is the implications of such incremental propagation for arrest or deviation of the fracture. And, how the incremental propagation length will influence whether a fracture will cross a discontinuity, branch and progress, or progress along the discontinuity. Discussion is also presented regarding how step versus no step fracture growth could influence localized fracture growth “fingering”.|","Hydraulic Fracture,  Fracture Propagation,  Rock Mechanics,  Fracture Fluid"

The laminas can act as weak interfaces confining the hydraulic fracture height growth and becoming potential fracture propagation path. We developed a numerical simulator using Finite-Discrete Element Method (FDEM) to simulate the complex fracture propagation in laminated shale formations. This is a 2D coupled fluid flow and geomechanics code which is capable of simulating fracture propagation in naturally fractured, laminated reservoirs. Several cases of multi-stage, multi-well fracture propagation were conducted using this simulator. Our simulation results show that for multi-stage hydraulic fracturing propagation, the fracture length along the BP is a deterministic factor affecting the neighboring fracture propagation path due to the induced stresses. Moreover, we proposed a novel multi-fracture, multi-stage fracturing design, which can create larger stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) than classical Texas two-steps technique in laminated shale formations under some specific scenarios. This paper provides a framework for more realistic prediction of fracture height and fracture evolution under multi-fracture, multi-stage schemes in laminated shale formations in hydraulic fracturing treatment.
1. INTRODUCTION
Horizontal wells with multi-stage hydraulic fractures (HFs) are proved to be the key techniques for maximizing the oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs with ultra-low permeability. During hydraulic fracturing treatments in unconventional reservoirs, complex fracture network can be developed for transporting hydrocarbon to the wellbore [1]. Many factors, such as mechanical properties of formations, properties of weak interfaces and completion designs etc., can have huge effect on complex fracture geometry. Shale formations typically have laminated structures which is in the form of bedding layers and stratification. The laminas can act as weak interfaces, and fractures can propagate along the BP interfaces [2]. Such geological media exhibit transversely isotropic mechanical behavior, which means that five independent mechanical material constants: Eh, Ev, Vh, Vv and G[3] are needed for mechanical characterization. Here, Eh and Ev are Young’s moduli in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively, Vh and Vv are Poisson’s ratios in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively, and G is shear modulus. Novel hydraulic fracturing simulations should contain these features to overcome the limitations of classical fracturing models.|","Document Type

C., Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC Rio)| Vargas, E. A. Jr., Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC Rio)| Palmeiro do Amaral, C., State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ)","|ABSTRACT: This paper presents analysis of the mechanical behavior of a tunnel, specifically assessing the degradation of gneiss rock mass excavated over time, in the southeastern region of the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The underground excavation has a depth of 300m in a rock mass containing three families of discontinuities, the intact rock showing degrees of alteration of its minerals. Scenarios for analyses are evaluated in conditions of very persistent and moderately persistent discontinuities with the purpose of observing their influence on the stability of the tunnel. Three scenarios of in-situ stress conditions are considered. Excavations with and without support elements were also considered. The supports were shotcrete with steel fibers, reinforcement cables and a mixture of the two. Two-dimensional numerical analyses of the stability of the excavation were carried out using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) through the software UDEC (Itasca, 2011). Failure mechanisms were observed plotting maximum shear displacement values in discontinuities. Sensitivity analyses were carried out in order to determine most sensitive parameters in relation to failure conditions.
1. INTRODUCTION
The behavior of a tunnel excavated in fractured rock mass depends of the resistance of the rock mass, in other words, of the intact rock and, mainly, of the existing directional features and discontinuities (fractures, joints, schist, plans of stratification), and the stress state acting around the excavation.
When the stresses induced around the opening exceed the resistance of the rock mass, plasticity effects occur, eventually leading to failures. The latter requires the installation of support to keep the stability of the excavation. This scenario is made more critical when, after the excavation of the tunnel, with and without support installed, weathering effects causes the reduction of the parameters of resistance of the rock mass. In particular, this is the case in Rio de Janeiro, where the hydrothermal alteration of the minerals determines a high degradation (change in the mechanical properties) of the rocks, causing a matter of concern due to the changes suffered by the rock. More precise numerical analysis of the stress-strain response of the rock mass requires discontinuum based models, amongst these the discrete element method (DEM). In the present paper, the software UDEC (Itasca) was used. It simulates discontinuum related behavior such as the fall of blocks of rock and large displacements in the fractured region. It allows studies of the current and future behavior of excavated tunnels in fractured rock masses, considering the inclusion of different constitutive models and pertinent geotechnical parameters for the different geological materials as well as different support systems.|","Document Type

M., Texas A&M University| Chester, J. S., Texas A&M University","|ABSTRACT: Uniaxial consolidation tests were conducted on reagent-grade granular salt in dry conditions at 150 C. 2D-microscopic images, parallel to the axis of consolidation, were obtained at several stages of progressive consolidation from 15% to 3% porosity. Microstructure image analyses were performed to obtain probability density functions (PDFs) of the area, solidity, coordination number, orientation, elongation and roundness of the grains, as well as the PDFs of the branch lengths, branch orientations and solid volume fraction, defined locally over polygons with edges matching grain centroids. It is found that sample deformation is mostly due to grain rearrangement and that upon consolidation, grains become less convex, and elongate in the direction perpendicular to the loading axis. Four fabric tensors were calculated to assess microstructure anisotropy induced by grain orientation, branch length orientation, grain solidity and local solid volume fraction. Fabric tensors were diagonal and orthogonal. Therefore, their product was used to define a global fabric tensor, which was introduced in the expression of the stiffness tensors. The constitutive parameters were calibrated against the consolidation tests. The approach paves the way to enrich continuum damage and healing mechanics model with fabric descriptors that can play the role of internal variables.
1. INTRODUCTION
Salt rock is often considered as an ideal material for geological storage of compressed air and nuclear waste, because of its low permeability and favorable creep properties. Salt is a polycrystalline material made of bonded crystals (called grains in the following). Salt stiffness depends on rock microstructure, which changes during the geostorage process. A micro-macro mechanical model is proposed to predict the evolution of stiffness, deformation and microstructure development during consolidation.
A fabric tensor is a symmetric tensor that captures anisotropy due to the presence of heterogeneities in a rock. A fabric tensor can be defined in many ways to characterize the microstructure arrangement of geomaterials, and is usually regarded as the second microstructure measurement, after porosity. Crack fabric tensors were defined with space distribution, density, shape, dimension, and orientation of cracks. A fabric tensor was defined based on the density, dimension, and angular distribution of branches linking particle centers (Oda, 1982). Stereological methods were used to characterize the distribution of directional data (Kanatani, 1984). A fabric tensor can be determined by calculating the local porosity on test lines drawn in various directions of space. A set of probe lines drawn at 10° (Muhunthan and Chameau, 1997) or a set of parallel test lines in a given direction were commonly used as test lines (Kou et al., 1998). The volume fraction, the mean coordination number, and the correction factor depending on grain size distribution were found to be essential descriptors of rock microstructure, and were introduced in the trace of fabric tensors (Madadi et al., 2004).|","Document Type

D., University of Colorado Boulder| Buscarnera, G., Northwestern University","|ABSTRACT: This paper focuses on the simulation of localized compaction in granular rocks. For this purpose, a continuum framework referred to as Breakage Mechanics is used to capture the role of microscopic crushing on the mechanical response of grain assemblies. In particular, grain size dependencies are introduced by connecting the physics of grain-scale fracture to the energetics of collective crushing. It is shown that this approach enables the simultaneous consideration of changes in grain sorting and average grain size, where the role of the latter is modeled via central splitting and contact fracture laws. Using this constitutive framework, the localization potential of Bentheim sandstone has been studied with the purpose to emphasize the role of grain scale characteristics in the inception of compaction banding. The analyses show that the model captures correctly the increase of the localization potential resulting from a coarser gradation or a narrow grain size distribution.
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding the processes that control compaction and faulting in reservoir rocks is crucial for many branches of geophysics and geo-engineering. In this context, a considerable challenge is due to compaction banding, a mechanism by which strains localize into narrow tabular zones (Aydin, 1978, Mollema and Antonellini, 1996, Fossen et al., 2007). These deformation bands are critical for the energy industry in that they lead to marked pore collapse and permeability loss, thus having considerable impact on reservoir integrity and injection/extraction efficiency (Wawersik et al., 2001).
A widely adopted tool to assess the localization potential of rocks is the bifurcation theory proposed by Rudnicki and Rice, 1975, often used in combination with elastoplastic constitutive laws. Among its many applications, this theory has been used to study compaction banding in porous rocks (Issen and Rudinicki, 2000) via cap-plasticity (Challa and Issen, 2004) or critical state models (Buscarnera and Laverack, 2013; Das and Buscarnera, 2014). These models are typically calibrated on the basis of the results of laboratory tests, which, in addition to measurements of stress-strain response, have often provided a link between shear-enhanced compaction and inelastic phenomena at the grain-scale (Wong et al., 1997, Klein et al., 2001, Wu et al., 2000, Besuelle et al., 2003, Baud et al., 2004). Recently, such multi-scale links have been exploited in the context of the theoretical and numerical modeling of compaction bands. An example is given by the work of Das et al., 2011, 2013, who studied compaction banding in sandstones through a microstructure-inspired constitutive framework referred to as Breakage Mechanics (Einav, 2007a,b). Starting from thermodynamic principles, this theory links the macroscopic yielding of a granular rock to the energy released by crushing events, thus enabling the simulation of the changes in grain size distribution due to high-pressure compaction. Despite its links with the micromechanics of grain crushing, recent findings by Zhang and Buscarnera, 2014 pointed out that the model lacks an inherent length scale related with the size of the largest grains, thus preventing the model from capturing major grain-size dependencies. Hence, to incorporate such length scale, Zhang et al., 2016 have recently augmented the framework by proposing a linear scaling law that connects the fracture properties of grains to the macroscopic critical breakage energy of the solid, thus bridging the physics of fracture at particle scale with the energetics of comminution at continuum scale.|","Document Type

W., Los Alamos National Laboratory| Cusatis, G., Northwestern University","|ABSTRACT: A three-dimensional discrete dual lattice model is formulated to investigate the permeability and mechanical behavior of fracture-damaged shale. The mechanical lattice model simulates the granular internal structure of material at the grain level, and describes the heterogeneous deformation by means of discrete compatibility and equilibrium equations. A network of fluid transport elements built upon the mechanical lattice is used to simulate fluid flow along intergranular pores and cracks. The variation of permeability for cracked material is captured by coupling mechanical and transport lattice models. A numerical example of direct shear triaxial test on Utica shale is simulated by the formulated framework. Variation of shale shear strength with the angle between the vertical bedding plane and the shear plane is captured. The permeability of the fractured specimens was obtained by simulating water flowing along the specimens. The numerical results show that the simulated effect of cracking on the overall permeability is in general qualitative agreement with available experimental data.
1. INTRODUCTION
Material characterization of gas/oil shale and shale-like rock, including study of their mechanical and hydraulic properties, is needed in many engineering practices such as hydraulic fracturing. Investigating the fracture- and damage-induced permeability variation of shale is necessary to understand and optimize oil and gas production. This involves quantifying damage and fracturing of material due to nucleation and propagation of microcracks and correlating permeability variations with damage by taking into account the multiscale nature of shale (Hyman et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016). Despite the urgent need to understand and characterize shale fracture permeability behavior, little work has been published to the best of authors’ knowledge.
Most experimental work related to the evolution of rock hydraulic properties with cracking and damage has investigated the permeability of prefractured (split or sawn) specimens (Gutierrez et al., 2000; Davy et al., 2007; Jobmann et al., 2010; Cho et al., 2013; Mokhtari et al., 2014). These studies clearly show that rock permeability is strongly related to density, spacing, orientation, width, and length of fractures within samples. Nevertheless, studies on shale permeability are substantially limited. It was suggested by researchers (Carey et al., 2015a; Carey et al., 2015b; Frash et al., 2016) that permeability studies of rocks fractured at in situ conditions through triaxial compression or direct shear tests better represent fracture properties in the subsurface than the ones using prefractured or artificial specimens.|","Document Type

W., University of Arizona| Sandbak, L. A., Barrick Gold Inc.","|ABSTRACT: In this paper, the stability of the tunnels in an underground mine was investigated by three-dimensional numerical modeling. Based on the available geological, geotechnical, and mine construction information, a three-dimensional model was built using the 3DEC code. The model contains the features of the inclined lithologies, a large-scale non-persistent fault, and a complex tunnel system. Stress analyses were performed on the rock mass having the elastic-perfectly plastic and strain-softening behaviors, respectively. The effects of the horizontal in situ stress and the support system were studied through the distributions of stress, displacement, and yielded zone around the tunnels. By comparing the numerical modeling results with the field deformation measurements, it was found that the strain-softening cases with the lateral stress ratios of 0.5 and 1.0 are accurate and applicable for this mine.
1. INTRODUCTION
The stability of the development tunnels is critical for an operating mine in ensuring the safety of the working places and the successful ore production. However, the rock mass behavior around underground excavations is rather complex due to a lot of factors. As a geological material, the rock mass includes natural discontinuities, such as joints, faults, bedding planes, shear zones, and dikes, which can significantly weaken the strength of the material (Aydan et al., 1997). As excavation goes down deeper, the problem of high in situ stress is encountered, resulting in large deformations and failure zones (Kulatilake et al., 2013). Additionally, the excavation geometries, the excavation layout, as well as the constructing sequences also play important roles on the stability of the underground openings (Chen, 1997; Bhasin et al., 2006; Chryssanthakis et al., 1997; Lu et al., 2012). Therefore, the assessment of the rock mass stability around underground excavations is challenging. To take care of many such factors, the numerical method has been proved as an efficient tool (Jing, 2003). Because of the geological characteristics of the rock mass and the many discontinuity-related failures in underground problems, the discontinuum modeling has gained a lot of attention and been widely used (Barla and Barla, 2000; Jing, 2003).|","Document Type

To better understand the sealant behavior of Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer (EPDM) gaskets widely adopted in tunnel lining segmental joints, a finite element (FE) model was established. The Mooney-Rivlin model was used to simulate the hyperelastic sealing material and the analytical rigid part was used to model the concrete groove. The external hydrostatic pressure was applied based on the deformed gaskets. The numerical results indicates that the distributions of contact stresses along the contact interfaces were significantly affected by the lateral water pressure.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Zhoujiazui Rd. Tunnel is the latest shield tunnel undercrossing the Huangpu River in Shanghai city. This mega infrastructure is now under construction and plans to open to traffic in January of 2019 and unites the Puxi area and the Pudong area (Fig. 1(a)).
Fig. 1(b) shows the longitudinal profile of the investigated tunnel prototype. The tunnel is mainly situated within stratum <U+2461> to stratum <U+2467>, and the most unfavorable water head is 60 m. According to the geotechnical report, the Shanghai soft clay strata exhibited high permeability. Assuming that the groundwater at the tunnel level is interconnected to the overlying soil layers and the river above, the 60-m water head produced significant hydraulic pressures on the tunnel structure. Such high-water-pressure conditions motivated this study of the waterproof performance of the tunnel.
2. BRIEF LITERATURE REVIEW
The sealant behavior of tunnel gasketed linings received considerable attentions in the early 2000s. Lum et al. (2002) conducted a comprehensive experiment on the waterproof performance and compatibility of various gasket profiles recommended for the Inland Feeder Arrowhead Tunnels in Southern California. Schurch (2002) summarized the key design considerations of Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer (EPDM) adopted for sealing the segmental joints. Shalabi et al. (2012) experimentally investigated the leakage behavior of single-gasketed tunnel linings under the design static and dynamic loadings of the Los Angeles Metro. The authors’ previous work (i.e., Gong et al., 2014 and Ding et al., 2017) conducted a comprehensive experimental study to recommend an engineering-adopted sealing gasket profile for the Nanjing Weisan Rd.

G., SCT Operations| Han, Y., Aramco Services| Quinlan, K., CSIRO Energy","|ABSTRACT: Controlled fracture geometry is one of the most important criteria that measure the success of a hydraulic fracturing treatment. Typical stress conditions often lead to generation of a planar vertical fracture. Even for this simple geometry, fracture growth in a multilayered rock depends on many factors, such as stress, toughness and modulus contrasts across layers, fracturing fluid viscosity and injection rate. In the present work, a new cell-based pseudo-3D (P3D) model, which uses plane strain deformation in each vertical cross-section and simplified 2D flow assumptions, is described, with an aim to extend the classical P3D model to consider the effect of multiple elastic layers. To capture the effect of viscous fluid flow on height growth, the flow direction at a point along a cell is taken either lateral or vertical, depending on the local pressure level. The lateral flow region is divided into a so called central part that is subject to the maximum fluid pressure in a cell and the vertical flow region which is called the filling segment or part of the cell. The vertical and lateral fracture growth is controlled by the toughness criterion, and, the lateral stress intensity factor is used to convert a filling segment into the central part so as to accelerate lateral fracture growth by changing the local pressure level to the maximum of the cell. The governing equations associated with the problem are provided. A comparison is made between numerical results and the fully 3D (F3D) simulations for a vertically planar fracture propagating in a homogeneous rock subject to stress contrast. The numerical results appear reasonably acceptable. Some solution features associated with the proposed model are delineated. In addition, a special example for hydraulic fracture propagation in a layered rock is examined and the fracture height is found to increase much slower than the fracture length.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracture treatments in multiple-layer, low- permeability unconventional gas reservoirs provide an important stimulation technology. In a layered rock formation, there are dissimilarities in confining stresses and material properties across the layers. The fracture height growth can be enhanced or constrained by these stress and material property changes (Palmer and Kutas, 1991; Gu and Siebrits, 2008; Gu et al., 2008), as well as by any slippage along the interfaces (Gu et al., 2008; Fan et al., 2014; Chuprakov et al., 2015;). Fracture containment or limited fracture height growth may result in dominant lateral fracture growth with fluid flow localized in the lower-modulus, lower-stress layers (Jeffrey et al., 1993).|","Document Type

This anhydrite to gypsum transformation (AGT) results in an increase in the solid volume by 61% and in a decrease or increase in the pore volume. On a macroscopic scale the so far insufficiently understood phenomenon “swelling of anhydritic rock” is observed, which is known to cause massive damage to underground constructions, such as tunnels. This contribution focuses on one specific aspect of AGT, the precipitation of gypsum directly on the surface of the dissolving anhydrite, which creates a diffusion barrier for the dissolving ions and slows further anhydrite dissolution down (hereafter referred to as “self-sealing”). The development of such gypsum layers on anhydrite is investigated experimentally by storing natural rock specimens consisting of 96%-99% anhydrite in water and observing the thickness of the developing gypsum layer optically via photography during the tests and via microscopic analysis after drying of the samples. The measured thicknesses corresponded well to the amount of precipitated gypsum determined post test via thermogravimetric analysis and to predicted values which were calculated with an existing kinetic model. The plausibility of this model could thus be verified so far. |1. INTRODUCTION AND CONCEPTUAL MODEL |As anhydrite comes into contact with water it will begin to dissolve under most circumstances below 40°C (at atmospheric pressure). As the saturation concentration with respect to anhydrite (ceq,A) is higher than that of gypsum (ceq,G), anhydrite dissolution results in oversaturation with respect to gypsum, thus triggering growth of gypsum crystals, whereby the solid volume of gypsum is 61% higher than that of anhydrite due to the additional water molecules bound in the crystals. The chemical reaction from anhydrite (CaSO4) to gypsum (CaSO4 • 2H2O) will be referred to here as AGT (Anhydrite – Gypsum Transformation) and can be formulated in short as CaSO4 + 2H2O > CaSO4 • 2H2O.|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Oil and gas wellbores experience a number of phases and scenarios during their lifespan. Drilling, completion, production and abandonment imply significant changes in the mechanical behavior of the well and its surrounding rock formation. Over the operational time, full evacuation maintenance periods occur, during which the internal pressure in the casing is drastically reduced. Moreover, the flow of fluids at different temperatures produces thermal processes through the casing (liner, overlap and pipes) that lead to a temperature rise in the salt formation. The stress state and temperature changes are even more relevant in Pre-salt wellbores since the creep behavior inherent to the salt rocks is strongly influenced by these two state variables.
This work presents a comprehensive Pre-salt wellbore application addressing key stages of the well lifespan. A synthetic (but representative) wellbore model is adopted as object of study to simulate borehole drilling, liner running (installation of the outer casing), overlap running (installation of the inner casing) and full evacuation periods. It is assumed that both casing running’s are simultaneously followed the cementation of the corresponding drifts or annular spaces. The analyses are carried out with an in-house thermo-hydromechanical (THM) finite element simulator, GeoFlux3D (Quevedo, 2012). This tool holds a number of capabilities of interest for wellbore integrity analysis, including procedures to simulate borehole drilling, casing running, salt creep and non-uniform loading schemes.

The process of fracture propagation is recorded using high speed camera to determine fracture propagation velocity and morphology. Simple models related to expansion work and heat energy caused by SC- CO2 phase change are to explain the experimental observations and results. The experimental results show that, due to strength weakening from CO2 adsorbed into the nano-scale fracture surface, the magnitude of fracture initiation pressure of SC-CO2 fracturing is lower than that of water-based fracturing. It is of interest that fracture propagation velocity of SC-CO2 fracturing is two order greater in magnitude than that of water-based fracturing, which shows that the energy release rate maybe sufficient for fracture branching. The expansion and thermal stresses induced by CO2 phase change, when the fracture instability occurs, further extend the fractures or even create multi-fractures. Eventually, the intermittent dynamic growth of multi-fractures occurs under the effect of CO2 phase change in SC-CO2 fracturing.
1. INTRODUCTION
It is widely accepted that the traditional hydraulic fracturing has some disadvantages, such as excessive water consumption, reservoir damage and underwater contamination and so on. Thus many efforts have been dedicated to mitigate or avoid those adverse effects, and SC-CO2 fracturing as the waterless fracturing technology has been studied by some researchers recently (Verdon et al., 2010, Ishida et al., 2012, Kizaki et al., 2012, Zhou and Burbey, 2014, Fang et al., 2014, Middleton et al. 2015, Zhang et al., 2016, Papanastasiou et al., 2016).
From the 1981 (Lillies and King,1982) the CO2-Sand fracturing technology prevails gradually and has been applied in different permeability(0.1mD-10D)and temperature (10-100°C) of reservoir (Gupta and Bobier,1998). Unlike the CO2-Sand fracturing, SC-CO2 fracturing needs relatively higher wellhead temperature and pressure to reach the supercritical state before the CO2 is pumped into the reservoir. The passive seismic data from the injection of water and CO2 in the case of very similar conditions suggests that CO2 fracturing treatment can be learned from the abundant experience of conventional fracturing (Verdon et al. 2010). Some SC- CO2 fracturing experiments (Ishida et al., 2012, Kizaki et al., 2012, Zhang et al.,2016) show that the number of branches of fractures generated by SC-CO2 is more than that generated by water, and the magnitude of initiation pressure for SC-CO2 is also lower than that of water. Both fluid compressibility and viscosity influence fracture propagation, with low viscosity being the more important property (Kizaki et al., 2012). Viscosity can greatly affect hydraulic conductivity and leak-off coefficient (Zhou and Burbey, 2014). As a result, the SC-CO2 leak-off greatly increases pore pressure in the vicinity of fracture tip which leads to decrease the initiation pressure (Zhang et al., 2016). In light of abundant experimental results and some theoretical invitations, SC-CO2 fracturing is feasible for shale reservoir (Middleton et al. 2015). Consequently, among the parameters, other than low permeability of tight reservoir (Cipolla et al., 2010), the horizontal stress difference (Olson and Pollard, 1989, Blanton, 1986), the bedding and natural fractures (Daneshy, 1974, Warpinski and Teufel, 1987, Warpinski, 1991, Fan and Zhang, 2014), rock brittleness (Rickman et al., 2008) and the treatment conditions (Soliman et al., 2000), the CO2 phase change plays a vital role on formation of fracture complexity.|","Document Type

Ureolysis-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (UICP) has been investigated as a method to plug leakage pathways in the near wellbore environment or in fractures. The enzyme urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to react with calcium to form solid calcium carbonate (similar to limestone). UICP test specimens were prepared in triplicate by filling 2.5 cm diameter <U+00D7> 5 cm long molds with sand and injecting both microbial and plant- based enzymes with urea and calcium solutions to promote precipitation. For comparison, Class H well-, fine-, and Portland Type I- cement specimens were prepared by mixing the cement paste (API 10B) then mixing with sand (ASTM C305). Compression strengths of the plant-based enzyme specimens reached 77% and 66% of the compressive strength of the 28-day well-cement and Type 1 cement mortars, respectively. The specimens also reached 83% of the 14-day fine cement strength. The results of this study indicate that the UICP produced specimens may have adequate strength for field applications.
1. INTRODUCTION
Ureolysis induced calcium carbonate precipitation (UICP) has been investigated for a number of engineering applications, in particular, as an environmentally friendly method of improving the performance of cement or concrete structures (De Muynck et al., 2010; Ramachandran et al., 2001, Phillips et al., 2013a). Such improvements documented in the literature include the remediation of cracks in concrete (De Belie and De Muynck, 2008; De Muynck et al., 2008; Van Tittelboom et al., 2010), incorporating microbes into cement-sand mortars to alter material properties, (Ghosh et al., 2005; Halder et al., 2014), and self-healing applications (Jonkers et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2014).
In previous research, UICP promoted by microbially produced ureases has been demonstrated in the field to seal hydraulic fractures (Cuthbert et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2016) and was recently demonstrated in the field to improve wellbore integrity by sealing a channel in the cement behind the casing (Phillips et al., manuscript in preparation). Data collected in the field is limited to pressure and flow measurements which can be used with observations from subsurface logging tools to estimate the wellbore integrity after treatment. However, it is difficult to assess material properties of the seals formed down-hole. The motivation for the research described here was to assess the strength of the UICP materials in the laboratory and compare them to well-cements typically used in subsurface oil and gas well-cementing operations.|","Document Type

F., Laboratory of Mechanics of Lille| Bian, H. B., Universite de Lorraine","|ABSTRACT: This work is performed in the framework of feasibility study of underground repository for High-Levels radioactive Wastes. Based on the design concept of ANDRA, the retrievability of waster packages requires ensuring the mechanical stability of the steel liner for several thousand years. During the lifetime of repository, the host rock is subjected to various coupled loadings, such as mechanical loading/unloading, ventilation and temperature variation. Moreover, the steel liner may be corroded by the eventual contact of groundwater coming from the host rock and then induce a degradation of its useful properties, including strength, permeability, gas production, volumetric expansions, etc… The combinative effects of the steel corrosion and the evolution of host rock deformation may induce an eventual structural failure of steel liner and an amplified fracture damage zone in the host rock. Therefore, the long-term safety of the repository requires a detailed study on the thermo-hydro-mechanics coupling effect including corrosion phenomena on the response of host rock. In view of this, a disposal tunnel supported by a steel liner is simulated and analyzed. Using THM coupling model, a series of parametric study is then performed to identify the influence of different corrosion phenomena, for instance, the corrosion velocity, the volumetric expansion of corrosion products and the mechanical properties of corrode steel as well as the temperature. The analysis of numerical results allows us capture the important issues controlling the influence of corrosion process of steel liner on the THM response of claystone
1. INTRODUCTION
In the framework of feasibility study of underground repository for high level wastes (HLW), the facts supported the design choices are primarily linked to manage the impact of HLW and protect man and environment. In view of this, the basic layout of underground HLW disposal repository is principally guided by its long-term safety and reversibility (fig. 1). In order to achieved this basic layouts, a multi-barriers concept composed of geological barrier and engineering barriers, is commonly adopted.

Our triple-stage, triple-wellbore hydraulic fracturing simulations are accomplished using fully coupled pore-pressure-stress analyses, a well-established mechanism-based intersection model based on cohesive zone model, and a novel universal wellbore-perforation model for simultaneous and sequential fracturing scenarios. We quantified cluster stimulation, the activation of a complex natural fracture (NF) network, and fluid infiltration depending on the stimulation scenario, wellbore pressure drop, randomly distributed perforation lengths, and fracturing fluid viscosity. The stimulation patterns are featured by the following: 1) dominant effect of the perforation tunnel lengths in the cluster stimulation in the presence of the wellbore model; 2) doubled cluster stimulation in the absence of the NF network; 3) more control on the cluster stimulation and wider stimulated reservoir volumes in sequential fracturing compared to simultaneous fracturing; and 4) stronger stress shadowing effect in sequential fracturing with hydraulic pressure connectivity of stage clusters through the wellbore. This mechanistic model that integrates the NF network, its intersection with the hydraulic fractures, and the hydraulic connection of perforations through the wellbore clearly demonstrates a technique to refine stimulated reservoir volumes and better explain microseismic anomalies.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing stimulation has been widely deployed for the economic production from hydrocarbon-bearing ultra-low permeable shale formations. The design and optimization of these stimulation processes strongly depends on robust computational models because of numerous controlling parameters and the complexity of the geological formations. As a dominating complexity in the hydraulic fracturing design, the natural fracture (NF) network and connections to the hydraulic fractures may improve or damage the long-term production from the hydrocarbon reservoir. For instance, the damage to the long-term production may occur due to the fluid flow interference of the offset horizontal wells through the NF network induced by primarily independent hydraulic fractures. This interference can be observed frequently in microseismic surveys, e.g. for a four-well pad as shown in Fig. 1. In this figure, the events associated with the stimulations along each horizontal wellbore are grouped together by a unique color. Due to the color overlap between all neighboring well couples, the fracture runaway from one wellbore to the other one is eminent.|","Document Type

The common practice in simulation of rock failure using this model is to allow brittle fracture of the contacts between particles or at most tensile softening at the contact points ignoring the shear softening of the material. To overcome this shortcoming, a plasticity model that allows both tensile and shear softening of the filling material at the contact points of the particles was implemented in the CA2 computer program. The model was calibrated to mimic the elastic behavior of the Pennsylvania blue sandstone. It is shown that for a more ductile material, there is less scatter of micro-cracking at the peak load. Furthermore, the ductility parameter appears to be a good tool in controlling the ratio of compressive to uniaxial tensile strength of rock. While the ductility of the filling at the contact points of the particles has a drastic effect on the macroscopic post-peak rock behavior in the direct tensile testing, its role in dictating the post-peak rock behavior in compression is negligible and needs further study. The combined effect of ductility and initial micro-cracking on rock strength characteristics was studied as well. The numerical results suggest that the ratio of Brazilian to direct tensile strength of the simulated material is affected by the initial micro-crack intensity; this ratio is around 1 for a material with no initial micro-cracks but it gradually increases as the initial micro-crack intensity is increased.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Bonded Particle Model (BPM) has found a variety of applications in rock engineering and rock mechanics owing to its simple constituent analogy to circular discs in two dimensions and spheres in three dimensions and its ability to model complex rock and soil behavior using simple contact models for interaction of the particles (Potyondy and Cundall, 2004; Norouzi et al., 2013; Fakhimi and Hemami, 2015; Lisjak and Grasseli, 2014). While the BPM has been considered as a great tool for geotechnical modeling, it has its own shortcomings and drawbacks. One of the challenges in BPM modeling of rock is the problem with obtaining realistic values for friction angle and ratio of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) to tensile strength; the friction angle and UCS values are normally underestimated by the BPM model using spherical or circular disks (Fakhimi, 2004; Wu and Xu, 2016).|","Document Type

An optimized Hydraulic Fracture design requires a better understanding of anisotropy in rock strength and its impact on fracture propagation. This paper presents a workflow to generate continuous fracture toughness (KIC) profiles (parallel to bedding and perpendicular to bedding) using laboratory generated correlations between fracture toughness and other rock properties like UCS, Young’s Modulus and Tensile Strength. Anisotropic nature of fracture toughness has not been studied in detail previously which this paper seeks to address. A Boundary Element Method model was used to study the effect of anisotropy in fracture toughness and the magnitude on fracture geometry for a field in North America. Fracture simulations show anisotropy in KIC does impact hydraulic fracture propagation especially in cases where stress barriers are absent and neglecting it would lead to inaccurate predictions of fracture geometry.
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding fracture growth across layers is critical to accurately predict fracture growth and in generating an optimized Hydraulic Fracture design. Fracture toughness (KIC) is often overlooked and considered unimportant since the in situ stress profile is considered the controlling factor when it comes to fracture growth, containment and geometry (Fisher and Warpinski, 2012.). In laminated formations, such as shales, fracture height predictions based on numerical models grossly overestimate the fracture height when compared with results from fracture diagnostics. (Baree et al., 2010).
Numerous authors published results indicating fracture toughness significantly affects fracture size (Thiercelin et al., 1989, Dudley et al., 2016, Abe et al., 1976, Shoji et al., 1985). Fracture toughness variations across different layers also have a significant effect on fracture geometry as shown by Settari (1988). Correlations of fracture toughness with P-wave velocity, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, UCS, Tensile strength and other physical properties have been derived from experimental data of different rock types (Barry et al., 1992, Zhixi et al., 1997, Brown and Redish, 1997). Dudley et al. (2016) developed correlations of fracture toughness with density, P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity exclusively for gas shales. None of the above studies considered the direction dependency of KIC. Ghamgosar et al., (2015) found that anisotropy has a strong influence on the magnitude of fracture toughness and crack propagation using the Cracked Chevron Notch Brazilian Disc (CCNBD) specimens of Brisbane sandstone.|","Document Type

The conventional techniques, such as laboratory core analysis and downhole acoustic/wireline logging can be expensive and sometimes uncertain to process for unconventional reservoirs. In this study, a convenient and cost-effective technology is presented that uses routinely available drilling data to calculate the geomechanical properties without the need for downhole logging operations. A wellbore friction model is used to estimate the coefficient of friction and effective downhole weight on bit (DWOB) from the routinely collected drilling data. The inverted rate of penetration (ROP) models use the estimated downhole weight on bit and formation lithology constants to calculate the geomechanical properties throughout the horizontal reservoir formations such as confined compressive strength (CCS), unconfined compressive strength (UCS), Young’s modulus, permeability, porosity and Poisson’s ratio. In this article, the field case study is presented for a sample North American well applied to the lower Eagle Ford formation. The calculated geomechanical property log is also verified with tests performed on cores in reservoir rock formations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Continuous monitoring of rock mechanical and reservoir properties along the wellbore in unconventional horizontal wells demands convenient and efficient logging techniques. The conventional logging techniques involve laboratory core analysis and well logging using sonic and resistivity image logs which are not readily available for all unconventional wells (1 in 10 or 1 in 20) mainly due to associated cost, data uncertainity and time consuming to process. Moreover there are possible risks and concerns of trapping logging tools downhole in highly deviated and horizontal wells drilled in unconventional reservoirs. For many years, researchers and engineers have been investigating several models and techniques to obtain geomechanical property logs for the successful development of unconventional resrvoirs and stimulation design for maximum hydrocarbon production. The Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining (AI&DM) or data- driven models were developed to generate synthetic geomechanical information from the conventional logs in shale plays (Eshkalak et al., 2013). The conventional log data from a shale well was used for training and calibration during neural network model development to generate the synthelic logs for other wells. This model provides better performance for the wells in proximity of the training well with actual geomechanical properties. A convenient ROP model was developed to calculate rock mechanical properties such as, confined compressive strength (CCS), unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and Young’s modulus (E) at each drilled depth from the routinely collected drilling data such as rate of penetration (ROP), weight on bit (WOB) and RPM (Hareland and Nygaard, 2007). In horizontal drilling, the actual downhole weight on bit differs from the measured surface WOB (obtained from on and off bottom hook load difference readings) due to the friction caused by drill string movement, rotation within the wellbore and wellbore geometry. A previously developed 3D wellbore friction model (torque and drag (T&D) model) was used to estimate the coefficient of friction and effective downhole weight on bit (DWOB) from the surface measurements of WOB, hook load, surface applied RPM along with the wellbore survey measurement, standpipe pressure and drill string information (Fazalizadeh et al., 2010).|","Document Type

Furthermore, comparison of different design methods in different countries and analysis of effective support techniques in karst areas will also be summarized.
1. INTRODUCTION
Associated with difficulties such as unexpected location and irregular geometry of karst caves, complexity of underground water conveyance, and subjectivity in rock mass classification estimation, the dynamic design and construction of tunnels in karst regions is complicated and challenging.
Current research focuses of tunnel construction in karst terrains are: advance geological forecast technology (Wang C.L. et al., 2013), tunnel support and ground treatment technology (Cui Q.L., 2015), analysis of surrounding rock and tunnel structure’s stability, deformation and internal forces under karst caves in different locations and geometries (Dong L.W. et al., 2014) as well as risk estimation. However, few papers have discussed the relation and interaction between design and construction. Based on experiences gained from a real tunnel construction project, this paper describes encountered problems, summarizes the successful experiences of this project as well as other international ones, and proposes systematic solutions in design and construction for future work in similar karstified regions.|","Document Type

Two deformation mechanisms named shear dilation and tensile parting occur in this process. Triaxial shear and hydrostatic pressure tests were conducted on specimens sampled from field-collected oil sand cores, so as to investigate the compressibility of shear dilation and tensile parting dilation of oil sand under the real water injection pressure as well as in-situ stress and temperature states in the field. It is revealed that the compressibility of the specimens under shear increases with increasing mean effective stress until strain-softening takes place, but displays an opposite trend thereafter. Moreover, such a compressibility increases with decreasing effective confining stress and temperature, or an increase in uniaxial strain. The tensile dilation tests, on the other hand, disclosed that the associated compressibility changes inversely proportional to the mean effective stress or temperature. Interestingly, an increased temperature of the injected fluid suppresses rather than promoting the compressibility of an oil sand reservoir. A wellpair in the Fengcheng oilfield of Karamay was examined to predict its ultimate injected water volume, producing a result very close to that recorded in the field.
1. INTRODUCTION
Micro-fracturing technology was originally applied in the development of marine oil sands in Alberta, Canada. Here micro-fracturing or water injection instead of hydraulic fracturing is a more appropriate term due to the absence of stress shadow effects in weak rocks (Lin et al. 2015&2016). Resulting from the historical glacial action, the solid particles of marine oil sands in Canada are characterized by an interlocking fracture similar to the over-consolidated soil (Oldakowski 1994, Yuan et al. 2011). On the other hand, the oil sands in Karamay, northwest China, belong to land-facies deposit in absence of glacial activities and their compaction, resulting in a loose fabric with scattered mud stringers (Yuan et al. 2013, Lin et al. 2015). Micro-fracturing by water injection has been widely implemented in the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects on oil sand reservoirs in Karamay, aiming to expand the pore space of the domain encompassing the dual wells, such that the preheating period to shorten the preheating stage and improve the propagation of steam chamber (Lin et al. 2016&2017). The micro-fracturing physical models of oil sand reservoirs in Karamay are given in Fig. 1.|","Document Type

Many important parameters that control producing well behaviors such as number of horizontal wells, spacing between fractures and wells, horizontal well completion configurations, stages per well, fracture type, average water requirement, depth, proppant type, hydraulic horsepower(HHP) per stage, Lb/ft2 of proppants per stage, number of stages, and lateral length of the horizontal wells, have been analyzed.
The proposed analysis is performed on 12 major shale gas and oil plays, for which the data were available. The analysis of the data identified similarity in completion strategies. Learning from these analyses can be used to predict completion strategies in new wells of old or new shale plays.
A case study from Niobrara shale (Colorado) is investigated. The procedure used in exploring the case study can be used as a decision criterion for similar cases in deciding stimulation configurations and main important factors that lead to the optimum way of developing these resources. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to correlate the commonly used completions strategies with geochemical and geomechanical properties of shale rocks.

Many horizontal wells and fracture stages are needed to drain a shale reservoir, and these is a need for effective fractures and horizontal wells to produce these reservoirs. We conducted a case study of the use of data analytics to study the Niobrara shale rock, and suggest the best completion strategies used to effectively produce from the shale rock.
We then compared the characteristics of the Niobrara shale rock with the 12 most common shale plays in North America. Geochemical and geomechanical properties of these shale rocks vary significantly among the reservoirs and vary within the same reservoir.

By taking advantage of current internet technologies, webGC provides users with faster and easier access to ground control designs, on-the-fly calculations for infield use, and instant collaboration between operational personnel and planning engineers. This shared platform will ensure more transparent calculations in cases of variable conditions as well as the instant recognition of problematic areas under specific design parameters. Due to increases in internet availability, data security, application maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility, it is expected that the mining industry will embrace this product as it has with other innovative web technologies.
This paper presents the concept, framework, and steps behind the development of a new web-based software package called, “webGC.” The ARBS and ALPS modules have been completed with current development focuses on the completion of the ARMPS module. Through introductions to and discussions of the current back-end database development, front-end user-application interfaces, and the deployment of beta modules, the purpose of this paper is to raise interest in webGC such that the industry will have a full understanding and experience with the application before launching the product in the Fall of 2018.

1. INTRODUCTION
Empirical methods are derived from statistical analysis of observations, and the application of these methods is therefore limited to conditions similar to the underlying data base. Practitioners must have a full appreciation for empirical design method’s limitations and the case studies that populate it. When it comes to pillar design for underground workings, the current state of practice is still empirical, complemented by numerical models where empirical results are lacking or conditions are too complex. Researchers have found that the strength of a pillar is dependent on the slenderness ratio, the pillar width (W) to pillar height (H) ratio. The directions of measure for the width and height dimensions are determined by the orientation of the minor and maximum principal stresses within the pillar.|","Document Type

Such simulations are intense from both CPU time and memory resources, which strongly suggests employing Model-Order Reduction (MOR) techniques to speed up them. Different types of Reduced-Order Models (ROM) have been proposed to alleviate this computational burden. MOR approaches are based on projection. They first execute a computationally expensive “offline” stage, during which the full-order model (FOM) is studied. Upon creating a ROM basis, the cheap “online” stage is then executed. Our reduction strategy computes a reduced subspace using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). We calculate a family of solutions of the problem, for a suitable sample of input conditions, where every single result is so-called a “snapshot.” We then ensemble all snapshots together to determine a compressed subspace that spans the solution.
Usually, POD employs a fixed reduced subspace of global basis vectors. The usage of global basis is not convenient to tackle problems characterized by different physical regimes, parameter variations, or moving features such as discontinuities and fronts. Having many snapshots to capture all these local features is unfeasible, which proposes seeking adaptive approaches based on a local basis. We thus develop an approach based on local POD basis to reduce geomechanics computations. We consider factors such as challenging variable boundary conditions and the role of the heterogeneity. Preliminary 2- and 3-D results show significant compression ratios up to 90%. We formally compare FOM and ROM and provide timing data to demonstrate the speedup of the procedure. Examples focus on linear and nonlinear thermo-poroelasticity. We employ continuous Galerkin finite elements for most of the discretizations.
1. BACKGROUND
Coupled flow and geomechanics simulations are highly complex and involve solving nonlinear algebraic systems of millions of equations and unknowns. Such simulations allow assessing reservoir compaction and subsidence with harmful effects in wells, cap-rock, faults, and the surrounding environment as well [1-3]. Those numerical studies are intense from both CPU time and memory resources standpoint. This CPU burden strongly suggests employing MOR techniques to perform simulations in real time that allow decision-making in a timely fashion.

"558","2017-0500","Application of Mortar Methods to Subsidence Computations","Florez, Horacio, The University of Texas at El Paso","|ABSTRACT: The mortar finite element method (MFEM) significantly reduces the computational cost of subsidence computations by avoiding conforming Cartesian meshes arising from the pay-zone (PZ) towards its surroundings, where we may employ instead unstructured meshes to represent complex geological features correctly. There is thus an apparent necessity of having non-conforming interfaces between the reservoir (RS) and its surroundings. To glue these non-matching subdomain problems, we utilize MFEM on curved 3-D boundaries represented by NURBS surfaces. We extend the approaches that we presented in ARMA papers 12-313 and 13-475. We decouple the mortar saddle-point problem (SPP) using standard domain decomposition techniques to exploit current parallel machine architectures. We demonstrate that this approach is suitable for field level computations. We conduct detailed benchmarks between the conforming and non-conforming solutions to validate the procedure. Examples involve coupling a continuous Galerkin finite element program for mechanics with a slightly compressible single-phase code.
1. BACKGROUND
Hydrocarbon production or the injection of fluids in a RS can produce changes in the rock stresses and in-situ geomechanics, potentially leading to compaction and subsidence with harmful effects in wells, cap-rock, faults, and the surrounding environment as well. We require accurate simulations to predict these changes and their impact. In such cases, the flow simulation needs to be coupled to geomechanics, causing a significant increase in CPU time and memory requirements [1-7].
The MFEM is a powerful technique to formulate a weak continuity condition at the interface of subdomains in which different meshes, i.e. non-conforming or hybrid, are used. The method allows coupling elasticity and poroelasticity on various domains, which is a necessity in coupled flow and geomechanics. A short introduction to MFEM, its historical development, and the classical references can be found in [1-3,8].
We presented in [9] a RS geometry reconstruction algorithm aimed to create conforming hexahedral meshes that are suitable for coupled flow and geomechanics. The technique exploits the RS’s geometrical simplicity to build a piecewise continuous representation using NURBS interpolation and translational surfaces; then transfinite interpolation is applied to generate hexahedral meshes. The resulting volume mesh extends the RS grid towards its surroundings, i.e. over- (OVB) and under-burden (UDB) and side-burdens. The success of the above algorithm suggests reconstructing the RS in the same way but allowing non-conforming meshes in different levels as shown in Figure 1. We thus revised our algorithm in [10] to improve its performance and to allow different meshes in the OVB and UDB respect to the PZ level. This new approach reutilizes the surfaces that were employed initially, and it also alleviates the necessity of propagating tensor product meshes, from the PZ, which increases the computational cost substantially. We present herein an MFEM that glues these three non-matching subdomains, and it guarantees that displacements are continuous across the given interfaces that are NURBS surfaces. We solve the resulting SPP to enforce continuity among the subdomains, and we also decouple it with the Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) domain decomposition method (DDM). We include a brief description of the MFEM, and we also comment about computing the mortar projector and its algorithms in pseudo-code. The results show that MFEM can tackle problems of practical interest even at the field level.|","Document Type

A large computational resource is required to store the coordinates, intersects and paths of NF network. To increase the computational speed and save the computer memory, the NF network and created hydraulic fracture (HF) network are mapped into NF graph and HF graph respectively based on the graph theory. A modified displacement discontinuity method (DDM) is used to simulate the process of network fracturing. The HF networks are mainly affected by the NF networks, the in-situ stress and the fracturing parameters. The higher net-pressure leads to a wider but shorter band of the HF networks. The higher stress contrast leads to a longer but narrower band of HF networks. A dimensional parameter <U+03C8> is defined as the net-pressure over the stress contrast. As <U+03C8> increases, the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) tends to increase. The stress interaction among the HFs in the fractured medium is similar to that in the isotropic, homogeneous medium, but more complicated because of the influence of NF network. Repelling behavior is observed in the simultaneous propagation of the multiple HFs.
1. INTRODUCTION
The NF network is an important tunnel for the oil and gas flowing in low permeability reservoir, such as shale oil and gas reservoir. The main purpose of the hydraulic fracturing technique in the shale gas reservoir is to create many HFs or connect numerous NFs (Wu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015a). However, the numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing in the naturally fractured reservoir gives rise to at least two challenging problems: storing the information of complex fracture networks efficiently; modeling the mechanical behavior of HF precisely.
A NF network with a random distribution in the reservoir is assumed in many recently articles (e.g. Olson and Dahi-Taleghani, 2009; Ren et al., 2016). Actually, the NF network in the rock is usually connecting, intersecting with the other NF network. Even though some papers used the discrete fracture network (McClure, 2012; Meyer and Bazan, 2011) to simulate the fractured medium, they didn't mention any algorithm to store the full information of NF network. This paper imports the graph theory (Wallis, 2000) from the discipline of computer science by storing the fracture network as a graph. The graph theory provides many approaches to capture the characteristics of the NF network, including the edge set, coordinate set, clustering coefficient, geodesic distance, et al. Similar to the NF network, the HF network is also stored as a graph. When the HF propagates step by step, or even intersects with the NFs, it is stored as a growing graph. As the hydraulic fracturing goes on, the HF network grows from simplicity to complexity as well as the HF graph.|","Shale gas,  Reservoir stimulation, Fracture network,  Network fracturing"

The specimens are 203.2mm high, 101.6mm wide, and 25.4mm thick. Two flaws, with 0.1mm aperture and 12.7mm length, are placed through the thickness of the specimen. The flaws are inclined 30° from the horizontal. Unbonded interfaces, inclined 10° from the horizontal, are created by casting the specimen in two parts. The first half of the specimen is cast against a PVC block with a face inclined 80° with respect to the vertical axis of the specimen. The second half is then cast against the first half. Sandpaper attached to the PVC block provides different friction at the interface and, using a debonding agent, a cohesionless contact is obtained. In the experiments, digital image correlation (DIC) is used to monitor crack initiation and propagation on the specimen surface by measuring displacements during loading. The experimental results indicate that specimens with the smooth interface have lower initiation and coalescence stresses than with the rough interface. Also, a smooth interface seems to arrest tensile cracks reaching the interface, while shear cracks can cross it. This mechanism seems to favor crack coalescence through shear cracks when the flaws are separated by a smooth interface, rather than through tensile cracks, which is what happens when there is a rough interface.
1. INTRODUCTION
The presence of discontinuities, i.e. fractures or cracks, plays an important role in rock mass behavior. Failures of structures in rock such as tunnels and foundations commonly originate through pre-existing discontinuities or through new discontinuities created by the stress state imposed by the engineered structures.
Experimental research has been extensively conducted on pre-cracked brittle materials to investigate crack initiation, propagation and coalescence under compression (Bobet and Einstein, 1998; Wong and Chau, 2001; Wong and Einstein, 2007; Park and Bobet, 2010). Coalescence can be described as the linkage of pre-existing flaws through the propagation of tensile cracks and/or shear cracks (Fig. 1). Tensile cracks usually propagate in a stable manner following a curvilinear path that aligns with the most compressive load; their surfaces are clean and do not contain any pulverized material. In contrast to the tensile cracks, shear cracks are characterized by the presence of crushed material and powder in their surfaces, and usually propagate in a stable manner, at least initially. They, however, may become unstable near coalescence. Shear cracks may be classified as quasi-coplanar or coplanar and oblique, depending on the angle of initiation with respect to the plane of the flaw from which they originate. Coplanar cracks make an angle of 45° or less with the flaw plane, while oblique cracks make an angle higher than 45°.|","Document Type

This fact motivates the present research, since industrial fluid extraction and injection processes are designed to minimize the implementation cost (energy, materials) and maximize the volume of fluid injected (or withdrawn). This work presents a bio-inspired fluid flow model to optimize the path that connects resource-rich pores in a rock. We explain the commonalities between the equations governing flow in a porous medium and growth of slime mold, an organism that dynamically deploys tube-like structures and adapts them as a function of their contribution to the overall network. We perform several simulations to analyze the influence of the pore size distribution and of pore spatial distribution on the topology of the extraction network predicted by the slime mold growth algorithm. We discuss the suitability of the biomimicry model to design fracture patterns for optimal fluid extraction from a porous rock.
1. INTRODUCTION
What fracture network topology optimizes fluid flow in a rock mass? Power laws and fractal dimensions govern most physical processes observed in nature. However, optimization algorithms that shape natural self-organization remain in many cases unknown. Furthermore, engineering approaches rarely consider nature as a guide to improve human systems and very few attempts have been made to explain the fractal nature of the topology observed in many connectivity networks.
The constructal theory (Bejan & Errera, 1997) is an optimization method for finite flow systems with configuration (e.g., slenderness), in which a purpose (e.g., heat collection) and constraints to the flow (e.g. mass balance) are established. This theory can be used to predict the topology of both natural networks, such as the design of the lungs (a H Reis, Miguel, & Aydin, 2004), and man-made networks, such as the layout of cities (Bejan & Lorente, 2008; a. Heitor Reis, 2006). Unlike other biological models of cell networks, the constructal theory is completely deterministic, predicting the layout of a network without prior assumptions. Major limitations are: (a) the need to assume controlling thermodynamic potentials, steady boundary conditions and uniform distribution of connecting points; (b) the absence of interaction dynamics from the formulation which disregards the fluctuations of the environment and the corresponding adaptation of the network. In the same way, Steiner tree algorithms allow finding: The minimum spanning tree from a set of points distributed in space; The global optimum from the creation of Steiner points that minimize the length needed to connect 3 points on the plane; The minimum network length concatenating those full Steiner trees using a combinatorial algorithm (Winter & Zachariasen, 1997).|","Document Type

E., The University of Texas at Austin","|ABSTRACT: Lost circulation, a major challenge in well construction, is the loss of drilling fluid into formation caused by wellbore hydraulic fracturing. Wellbore strengthening techniques can be applied to mitigate lost circulation by generating resistance to the growth of induced or natural fractures. In this paper, a fully coupled hydraulic fracture propagation model is presented to simulate lost circulation and wellbore strengthening. A near-wellbore stress analysis is performed to characterize wellbore mechanical responses during lost circulation. The analysis validates the hypothesis of hoop stress enhancement and emphasizes the impacts of poroelasticity involved in the stress enhancement. In addition, a novel approach integrating fracture resistance enhancement mechanism (i.e., tip protection) into hydraulic fracturing simulation is introduced and is used to quantify fracture gradient enhancement for drilling operations. Case studies are performed to assess different sealing conditions. Results show remarkable declines of fracture fluid pressure across the sealant and substantial reduction of fluid loss into the fracture. Case study concludes that fracture tip protection can be achieved through both fracture sealing and fracture fluid dissipation. Some operational insights on wellbore strengthening design are also extracted from this study.
1. INTRODUCTION
Drilling operations require maintaining both hydrostatic and equivalent circulating density of drilling fluid within the mud weight window (MWW), which is bounded by a lower limit preventing fluid influx and wellbore instability and by an upper limit (i.e., fracture gradient) avoiding wellbore fracturing. A narrow MWW often arises in depleted formations where fluid production reduces the fracture gradient and when drilling extended-reach wells which possesses large wellbore pressure fluctuation. Lost circulation is a major problem in drilling with a narrow MWW. Under the circumstances, fluid loss disturbs the normal downhole condition, causing consequent chain reactions (e.g., underground blowout, unplanned casing point, etc.). Thus, nonproductive time has to be taken to remedy the wellbore and in turn leads to excessive expenses toward well construction.|","Document Type

D., Stanford University| Pourpak, H., CSTJF, Total S.A.| Onaisi, A., CSTJF, Total S.A.","|ABSTRACT: The problem of dynamic shear (mode II) rupture on a non-growing fracture embedded in a solid continuum is traditionally solved using a standard split-node finite element method by permitting displacement discontinuity on the fracture while imposing contact constraint via a Lagrangian multiplier or a penalty regularization. In the presence of fluid pressure, this framework can be adjusted accordingly using an effective stress formulation, hence, in principle, can be used for modeling a rupture process in a fluid-filled porous medium and the associated microseismic source responses. However, if the porous medium is subjected to pressure spatial variations, the pressure gradient then acts as a body force, as naturally predicted by the force balance law, generating additional flow-driven stress in the medium. Moreover, when fractures are present, the pressure gradient across fractures is often discontinuous, further complicating the flow-driven stress state. Such coupling effects are rarely included in currently available rupture codes, hence limiting their applications to fluid-induced seismicity. In this study, we take into account flow-driven stress and provide a numerical modeling framework for fluid-induced quasi-static triggering and dynamic shear rupture processes on pre-existing discontinuities. Through a simple configuration in which two natural fractures intersect a hydraulic fracture, we illustrate how a flow-driven rupture process can be used to understand microseismic source responses, estimate permeability enhancement, as well as provide potential explanations for some curious injection-related geophysical observations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fluid injection and withdrawal can induce seismicity on a wide range of scales (Ellsworth, 2013). Occurrence of such seismic events poses major environmental and public concerns in activities including CO2 capture and sequestration, wastewater injection and conventional hydrocarbon production. On the other hand, events at a much smaller scale, known as microseismic events, are considered as an important mechanism to enhance fluid flow and are stimulated in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs and geothermal systems with ultra-low permeability. In any case, an understanding of the associated physical process is crucial for effective control and management of these fluid-induced (micro)seismic events.|","Microseismicity,  Dynamic Shear Rupture,  Finite Element Method, Fluid Flow,  Induced Seismicity,  Poroelasticity,  Fractured Porous Media"

1. INTRODUCTION
The ecological environment of mining area is fragile in western China, and shallow coal seam mining is vulnerable to water and sand inrush. Han et al. (1992) and Fan et al. (1992) were the first to study the formation mechanism of water and sand disaster. Subsequently, the geological environment and control methods for the formation of water and sand disaster was explored (Fan et al. 1996; Fan et al. 1996). The thoughts of coal mining under water-containing was proposed to avoid the occurrence of water and sand inrush and protect the groundwater resources (Fan et al. 2005; Miao et al. 2007; Miao et al. 2009; Fan et al. 2015). According to the geological conditions, the exploitation area under water-containing is divided (Wang et al. 2010).

The work process of the ultrasonic detection is introduced with a detection case of a coal mine goaf under a railway bridge in Shanxi, China. The ultrasonic reflection signatures of wall, fork and ground obstacle of the mine roadway have been discussed.

The detection results provides the key data for the treatment of the goaf area.
1. INTRODUCTION
Due to the disordered over-exploitation of coal resources, there are plenty of coal mine goafs with unknown shapes in many areas of China (Han et al., 2011a). The exist of coal mine goaf is a safety problem, for it may cause land subsidence and ecological environment destruction, which may bring great damages to the economy and society development of themining area (Wang et al., 2015, Fan and Liu, 2017). The treatment of coal mine goaf have become a current urgent duty.
An accurate and effective detection of goaf area can ascertain the distribution of goaf roadways, which is the key data for the safety evaluation and hazard control of goaf treatment projects. At present, many detection methods have been used in the world, such as the transient electromagnetic method (Han et al., 2011b), high-density electrical methods (Wu et al., 2016), and shallow seismic reflection method (Thomas and Holzer, 1986). Most of these methods are indirect detection methods, which are used to determine the general range of the coal mine gaof area in most cases. The accuracy of these methods is not enough for the actual engineering requirements of the treatment of the coal mine goaf. The laser range imaging method (Ding, 2015) can directly detect the shape of roadway through a borehole, however, it can easily get disturbed by borehole water curtain. Otherwise, the laser can not pass through muddy water, thus the laser range imaging system can not work in water-filled goaf. Aiming at these problems, this paper proposes using the ultrasonic imaging technology to detect the water filled goaf of coal mine for the first time. The basic principle of ultrasonic imaging technology is explained. The work process, data analysis and detection effects of the ultrasonic imaging technology are discussed with an example of the detection of a coal mine goaf in Shanxi, China.|","Document Type

B., Institute of Mine Seismology| Olivier, G., Institute of Mine Seismology","|ABSTRACT: Seismic wave velocities are sensitive to rockmass properties including fracture density and orientation, and stress amplitude and orientation. By measuring small changes in the seismic wave velocities, over time it is possible to track changes in the rockmass properties. In mining the rockmass properties are being changed on a regular basis as the rock is removed or pillars are formed. By tracking these changes, it is possible to get a better understanding of the effect mining is having on the rockmass. These changing rockmass properties are important for static stress modelling of the mine and for stability analysis. We use two methods of tracking seismic wave velocities in an underground mine. These methods are 1) active seismic source where a pneumatic hammer is used to generate repeatable impacts which can be measured a few hundred meters away from the source; and 2) ambient noise where background vibrations produced by mining activity are used to turn seismic sensors in to virtual active sources. These two methods then allow us to measure 3D and directional velocity changes where these can be compared with mining activities to get a better understanding of the effect of mining on the rockmass.
1. INTRODUCTION
Deep underground mines are highly stressed environments, where seismic activity and rock falls can be significant hazards. Thus, seismic monitoring networks have become more common in mining environments. It is important for geotechnical engineers to monitor the rock mass response to mining over time since most seismic events in mines are induced by mining activities. Over the last 20 years, seismic monitoring in mines has made great progress as a tool to analyze some of the risks involved in mining at depth, but seismic activity alone is hard to interpret.
Seismic velocities of intact rock have been known to be sensitive to the internal state of the rock mass. Changes in applied stress (Larose and Hall, 2009), pore pressure (Brenguier et al., 2014) and fracture density (Nur and Simmons, 1969; Nur, 1971) have all been shown to cause measurable changes in seismic velocity. The relationship between seismic velocity and stress has been investigated for many years to try to understand the time dependent seismic velocity variations. This is a possible method to predict earthquakes, as it is generally assumed that earthquakes initiate due to the accumulation of stress on a fault.|","Document Type

V., University of Houston","|ABSTRACT: This paper studies the problem of the near-tip region of a fluid-driven fracture with proppant that propagates in a permeable linear-elastic medium at a constant velocity. To deal with this problem, an equivalent problem for the semi-infinite hydraulic fracture with proppant is considered. It is assumed that the proppant is located within a plug, in which its concentration is equal to the maximum value. The boundaries of this proppant plug are defined by the prescribed particle radius (which is used in the bridging criterion) and the entire volume of proppant in the fracture. The fracturing fluid permeates through the proppant plug according to Darcy’s law, which leads to a strong pressure change over the proppant zone. To address the problem, we use a non-singular formulation, which was developed previously to solve the problem of a semi-infinite hydraulic fracture without proppant and allows us to use standard numerical techniques to effectively obtain the numerical solution. The computed numerical solution quantifies the influence of proppant plug on the fracture width and shape, which results mostly in fracture widening. Fracture width solutions with different proppant sizes, proppant volumes, fluid viscosities, and leak-off coefficients are compared. |1. INTRODUCTION |Hydraulic fracturing is a technique that is used in oil and gas industry to increase the recovery of hydrocarbons from underground reservoirs (Economides and Nolte, 2000). In this technique, fluid is injected into the formation under high pressure, which breaks the rock and generates fractures. Proppant particles are often added to the fracturing fluid to keep the fracture open after the treatment. To better understand the global behavior of fluid-driven fractures, it is important to study the processes that occur near the fracture tip, see e.g. Detournay (2016). |The problem of the tip region of a hydraulic fracture is equivalent to the semi-infinite hydraulic fracture, as was shown for a planar fracture geometry in (Peirce and Detournay, 2008). This semi-infinite hydraulic fracture problem has been studied extensively for more than two decades (Desroches et al., 1994; Lenoach, 1995; Garagash and Detournay, 2000; Detournay, 2004; Garagash et al., 2011; Dontsov and Peirce, 2015). It is known that the solution it determined by a competition of different physical processes, which may include rock toughness, fluid viscosity, and fluid leak-off. Fluid lag, which is caused by the presence of cavity near the fracture tip, is not considered in this study, see e.g. (Garagash and Detournay, 2000; Detournay, 2004) for the analysis of such a problem. The situation, in which the viscosity dominates the response, leads to the so-called viscosity dominated solution, which was obtained in (Desroches et al., 1994) for the power law fluid rheology. If leak-off dominates, then the solution corresponds to the leak-off dominated regime, and it was obtained for power law fluids in (Lenoach, 1995). The toughness dominated solution corresponds to a ""dry"" crack (i.e. without pressure gradient), for which the solution stems from the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) (Rice, 1968). The complete problem, that accounts for all three physical processes (fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and fluid leak-off) was analyzed and solved numerically its (Garagash et al., 2011). This problem was later considered in (Dantsov and Peirce, 2015), where the so-called non-singular formulation was developed. This non-singular formulation rewrites the problem solely in terms of fracture width and eliminates the fluid pressure dependence, where the latter is singular at the fracture tip and can lead to a more complicated numerical scheme. As a result, the numerical solution can be effectively obtained using standard numerical techniques.|","Document Type

The implemented failure criteria are used to assess the stability of the borehole wall and to establish the optimal pressure of the drilling fluid. BAAR can be additionally used for the estimation of principal stress magnitudes based on the measurements of breakouts and tensile fractures, the estimation of strengthening effect of intermediate stress on the rock medium around the borehole, the study of the heat and pore pressure distribution in the rock medium and its effect on the stress field. We present an example of the stability analysis for the transversely isotropic Sasino and Paslek shale formations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Borehole stability analysis is crucial to the success of drilling, stimulation, and production processes. Borehole wall is a surface of discontinuity, on which stresses concentrate. High stress concentration may lead to compressive failure of the borehole wall i.e. initiation of the breakout zone, which can cause technical issues, and in extreme cases loss of the borehole. Borehole stability can be ensured mechanically by controlling borehole-fluid pressure and to a lesser extent by modifying its temperature and chemistry.
We develop Breakout Analysis for Anisotropic Rocks (BAAR) code in MATLAB to study stress distribution around the borehole and its effects on borehole stability. The analysis is performed for the plane strain state in the plane normal to the borehole axis. We derive an analytical solution for the stress concentration around a circular hole in an orthotropic elastic medium, which is based on the complex variable method by Mushkhelishvili (Lekhnitskii 1968, Savin, 1968). The analytical solution provides both the stress and displacement fields. The thermal stress component is calculated based on a series solution to the transient heat conduction problem in polar coordinates (Nowacki, 1970, Carslaw and Jaeger, 2011). Borehole stability analysis in BAAR can be conducted using several failure criteria such as Mohr-Coulomb, Drucker-Prager, Lade-Duncan, or Wiebols-Cook (Colmenares and Zoback, 2002; Zhang et al., 2010), facilitating a comprehensive approach to the problem using all available data. We present several examples of BAAR applications, including the borehole stability analysis for transversely isotropic shale formations of the Lower Palaeozoic Baltic Basin.|","Document Type

A., Utah State University| Schmitt, D. R., University of Alberta| Chen, X., University of Alberta| Evans, J. P., Utah State University| Shervais, J. W., Utah State University","|ABSTRACT: Empirical, core-based, predictive correlations for the calculation of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) were developed from compressive sonic velocity measurements (55 whole core samples) and porosity, density, and unconfined compressive tests (110 whole core samples). The samples were collected at 55 different depths in a 550 m (1800 ft) interval of core from the MH-2 borehole located in southern Idaho, USA. The western Snake River Plain is a known region of high heat flow and the borehole was drilled into a potential geothermal reservoir characterized by artesian flow of high-temperature (~140°C) fluids from fractured basalt. The UCS values were measured in unconfined compressive tests, density and porosity were measured using a He-pycnometer, and p-wave velocities were measured in a pressure vessel under variable confining pressures. We use correlations between density and p-wave velocity (R2 = 0.91), UCS and porosity (R2 = 0.78), and UCS and p-wave velocity (R2 = 0.79) in a method to calculate calibrated UCS from wireline logs. The impact of this predictive correlation is that UCS can be calculated from as little as a bulk density log when sonic logs and core are not available, greatly increasing the number of wells in which we can obtain a local UCS estimate.
1. INTRODUCTION
This paper is part of a study that focuses on the characterization of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), elastic rock properties, fractures, faults, and the in situ stress state that likely control fluid flow pathways in a potentially commercial geothermal reservoir (Shervais et al., 2013). Borehole MH-2 was one of three drilled as part of The Snake River Scientific Drilling Project (Project Hotspot) to examine the potential for the presence of commercial geothermal energy resources in the volcanic provinces of the central and western Snake River Plain, Idaho, USA (Shervais et al., 2013, 2014). MH-2 was drilled to a total depth (TD) of 1821 m (5974 ft) on the Mountain Home Air Force Base (MHAFB), near the town of Mountain Home, Idaho (Figure 1) and encountered a ~140°C thermal artesian flow zone in basalt at a depth of 1745 m (5726 ft).|","Document Type

The project involves twin bored tunnels, cut-and-cover tunnels, three deep stations and one sequential excavation cavern that will encounter the Fernando Formation bedrock, which underlines the alluvium. The Fernando Formation consists of a poorly bedded to massive clayey siltstone to silty claystone that is poorly cemented and extremely weak to very weak per ISRM (1978). This paper presents the geotechnical engineering characteristics of the formation based on field investigation and laboratory testing.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Regional Connector Transit Corridor project consists of 3.0 km long new tracks of connection between a number of existing light rail transit lines in downtown Los Angeles. The project elements include three deep stations, one cavern using the sequential excavation method (SEM), segments of tunnels using a tunnel boring machine (TBM), and cut-and-cover guideway structures. The subsurface conditions along the tunnel alignment generally consist of artificial fill overlaying finer-grained alluvium (dominantly medium dense to dense sandy soils), underlain by coarser-grained alluvium (a wide variety of medium dense to dense sandy and gravely soils). Below the coarser-grained alluvium is the Fernando Formation, which is characterized as extremely weak to very weak sedimentary bedrock; a long segment of the project alignment will be excavated in this formation. The geologic profile along the alignment is shown in Figure 1.
2. OVERVIEW AND BASIC PROPERTIES
Based on a large number of geotechnical investigations performed for the project alignment, the Fernando Formation commonly consists of a weathered profile, ranging from “moderately weathered” to “highly weathered”, which overlays a “slightly weathered” to “fresh” profile. The thickness of the more weathered, weaker bedrock ranges from 0 to approximately 60 feet (1 foot = 0.305 m) along the project alignment. As shown on Figure 1, the thickest weathering underlies the high terrain in the vicinity of 2nd Street and Hope Street (i.e. from approximately Station 29+00 to 45+00 feet), where the depth to slightly weathered/fresh bedrock ranges from approximately 30 to 60 feet below the top of bedrock. The thickness of the more highly weathered bedrock decreases toward the flanks of the hill. Although bedrock is generally massive, the bedrock contains discontinuities that include bedding planes (bedding plane partings/bedding plane joints), joints and shears.|","Document Type

V., University of Houston","|ABSTRACT: The goal of this study is to compare two Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) hydraulic fracture models with non-local elasticity: the enhanced PKN (EPKN) model and the 2D Displacement Discontinuity Method (2D DDM). The elasticity equation in the EPKN model is obtained by substituting the elliptic vertical width profile into the elasticity integral for a planar crack. The 2D DDM elasticity equation is based on the plane strain solution and has a correction factor that is added to account for the finite height of the PKN fracture. Both approaches are implemented using a fixed mesh algorithm, where the tip asymptotic solution is used to advance the moving fracture front. To verify the accuracy of the algorithm, its plane strain version is tested against the reference solutions for the plane strain hydraulic fracture for different regimes of propagation. To evaluate the two non-local elasticity models, their predictions are compared to the reference numerical solution, obtained using a fully planar algorithm, for PKN fracture geometry. It is shown that the EPKN method has a better agreement with the reference solution, while the 2D DDM approach causes an approximately 20% error in the fracture length estimation for the considered cases.
1. INTRODUCTION
The process of fracture generation and propagation in a rock formation due to injection of a highly pressurized fluid is called hydraulic fracturing. This technique is often employed by the petroleum industry to stimulate oil and gas wells by creating permeable channels within the reservoir (Economides and Nolte, 2000). The physical processes occurring in hydraulic fracturing include elastic equilibrium of rock, fluid volume balance and its flow within the crack, and a criterion for fracture propagation. There are various numerical models that are able to incorporate all these processes into a hydraulic fracturing simulator, see e.g. review papers (Adachi et al., 2007; Weng, 2015).|","Document Type

V., University of Houston","|ABSTRACT: The injection of slick-water at the high rates used to fracture unconventional shale-gas reservoirs results in flows that are turbulent - particularly near the wellbore. In this paper we consider the effect of turbulence on the simultaneous propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures that are constrained to evolve in parallel planes. The effect of turbulence is captured using a modification of the Darcy-Weisbach fluid-flow model with an adaptation of Churchill's friction factor approximation to fracture flow geometries that is able to capture the transition from laminar to fully turbulent flow. Since the Reynlods number is proportional to the fracture width, the flow transitions to laminar close to the tip where the fracture width approaches zero. The model used in this paper is therefore able to exploit the multi-scale laminar tip asymptotic behaviour in order to use the Implicit Level Set Scheme (ILSA) to locate the fracture free boundary and to identify the propagation regime. We provide a numerical example for an array of five uniformly distributed planar fractures in which the laminar model exhibits significant stress shadowing while the turbulent model predicts substantially less. This reduction in stress shadowing in the turbulent flow model is due to the significantly larger pressure drop near the well-bore compared to the laminar case that dominates the mutual stress interactions between the fractures in the array.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fractures are tensile fractures induced in a rock formation by the injection of a pressurized fluid. This technique is used to stimulate oil and gas wells Economides and Nolte (2000), for waste disposal Abou-Sayed et al. (1989), to enhance rock mining Jeffrey and Mills (2000), for CO2 sequestration, and for geothermal energy extraction Brown (2000). To increase the treatment efficiency in unconventional tight-gas reservoirs multiple hydraulic fractures from different perforations are often generated simultaneously from one wellbore. In this situation, outer fractures induce additional compressive stresses on inner fractures and cause non-uniform fracture growth. This phenomenon is called stress shadowing and has been addressed in numerous studies Olson (2008); Singh and Miskimins (2010); McClure and Zoback (2013); Kresse et at. (2013); Peirce and Bunger (2014); Daneshy (2014); Wu et at. (2015); Skomorowski et al. (2015); Kumar and Ghassemi (2015); Manchanda et al. (2016); Dontsov and Peirce (2016) and can significantly affect the fracture geometry and the associated production rate. For this reason, it is important to develop numerical models that are able to predict simultaneous growth of multiple hydraulic fractures and that can be used to design more efficient hydraulic fracture stimulations.|","Document Type

W., University of Leeds| Stuart, G. W., University of Leeds","|ABSTRACT: We examine P-wave propagation in a fractured medium using effective medium, explicit fractures, and localized effective medium representations of fracturing, to quantify their effectiveness. We model a published experiment with multiple parallel fractures. Initial models assume uniform fracture stiffness across all fractures. A methodology is presented for inverting a source from the experiment. We find that the waveforms from the three models do not match each other. For propagation parallel to the fractures, the explicit model performs best with excellent agreement with the experimental waveform. The waveform from the localized TI model is reasonably similar, matching arrival, predominant period, frequency content, but not amplitude. The TI model is a poor match with significant differences in period, amplitude and high frequency content. For perpendicular propagation, none of the models properly match the experimental waveform. All models reproduce the significant delay in arrival, but only the explicit and local TI models produce a reduction in period and frequency content mimicking the experiment. All models produce a reduction in amplitude but not to the degree of the experiment. An explicit model accounting for the effect of the non-uniform stress-field better matches the experiment, indicating similar developments are needed for the other two representations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fractures in rocks are significant in a number of engineering applications. For example, an assessment of rock fractures is extremely important for characterizing the effectiveness of the geological barrier to a nuclear waste disposal repository, as they can provide fluid pathways, increasing the rock permeability. By examining the full waveform from either active or passive seismic sources we can obtain information on fracturing as seismic waves interact with the fractures (e.g., Schoenberg, 1980). Many studies (e.g., Crampin, 1981, Hudson, 1981, Majer, et al., 1988, Rathore, et al., 1995, Kawai, et al., 2006, Tillotson, et al., 2011, de Figueiredo, et al., 2013, Ding, et al., 2014, Tillotson, et al., 2014) have assumed that the response of a large number of fractures, can be mapped into the overall effective behavior of the medium, by linking the elastic constants with the fracture density and orientation, leading to anisotropy in the wave velocities (effective medium modelling). An alternative approach is discrete fracture representation using displacement discontinuities. The model was introduced for seismic wave propagation by Schoenberg (1980) and has been studied by numerous authors, (e.g., Pyrak-Nolte, et al., 1990, Nakagawa, et al., 2002, Hildyard, 2007, Chichinina, et al., 2009b, Perino, et al., 2010, Fan & Sun, 2015, Shao, et al., 2015). Pyrak-Nolte et al. 1990 examined the displacement discontinuity model for elastic wave propagation through multiple parallel fractures, in an experiment using laminated steel plates to simulate natural fractures. Hildyard (2007) then showed that an explicit representation of the fractures could match the experimental recorded waveforms but only if the effect of a non-uniform loading on fracture stiffness was included. In this research we try to model this experiment on laminated steel block (Pyrak-Nolte, et al., 1990), using the numerical modelling code WAVE3D (Hildyard, et al., 1995) to demonstrate the resulting changes to seismic waveforms for both effective and discrete fracture models, in order to establish under what conditions each representation is most appropriate and how close the models are to producing real effects on waveforms.|","Document Type

Coquina is a limestone consisting of shells cemented with calcium carbonate and quartz sand. Split tension testing was conducted on specimens cored from blocks of coquina. Core samples with diameters of 50.8 mm, 70 mm and 94.6 mm were obtained both perpendicular and parallel to bedding. Seventy-five specimens were tested. Results indicate there is variability between tensile strength of specimens obtained from different blocks. The relationship between tensile strength and unit weight was more variable than expected considering the simple composition of the coquina. Based on the limited testing of specimens cored perpendicular to bedding, coquina is transversely isotropic and there is an decrease in tensile strength with increasing specimen size. Acid bath testing was used to determine the percentage of quartz sand in the specimen in an attempt to relate cementation, expressed as a mass percentage of sand, to tensile strength.
1. INTRODUCTION
Spanish explorers attempted to settle on the southeastern coast of the current United States numerous times during the 1500s. On March 27, 1513, Ponce de Leon a conquistador from Valladolid declared the name La Florida on the land somewhere between modern day St. Augustine and Cape Canaveral, Florida. In 1565, the city of St. Augustine was successfully founded, making it the oldest continually occupied settlement of European origin in the continental United States. St Augustine became an important military and mission town for the Spanish for the next 198 years (May and Diaz Balsera, 2014).
One important historic structure in St. Augustine is the Castillo de San Marcos. It is the oldest masonry fort in the continental United States and the oldest building in St Augustine. The fort is over 315 years old and is constructed of coquina. The coquina was quarried from the north end of the Anastasia Island, across the Matanzas Bay. The Castillo is one of only two fortifications in the world built out of coquina, the other is Fort Matanzas National Monument which is located 14 miles south of the Castillo (VanVleet and Spikes, 1993).|","Document Type

However, a number of recent studies have raised valid concerns regarding the efficacy of the utilization of Brittleness Index alone as selection criteria for hydraulic fracturing purposes. The alternative selection criteria proposed by researchers is a measure of the ease of fracability which utilizes a combination of the Brittleness Index along with the fracture toughness. In the present study, experiments were performed on rocks representing multiple lithologies to obtain the various input parameters required to estimate B.I. Parameters obtained from the experiments include the unconfined compressive strength (UCS), Young’s Modulus, Poisson’s ratio and Brazilian tensile strength. The ISRM recommended Cracked Chevron Notched Brazilian Disk (CCNBD) method was used to evaluate the fracture toughness of the samples. Brittleness Indices based on lab measured properties were then calculated to observe variation of Brittleness Index, fracture toughness and fracability index (F.I.) with rock mechanical properties and to provide a data based evaluation of the applicability to hydraulic fracturing design.
1. INTRODUCTION
Laboratory studies, to evaluate mechanical parameters for geomechanical models addressing unconventional well design, completion and production usually focus on estimating failure characteristics, elastic anisotropy parameters and strength. The results of these tests find applications in wellbore stability assessment and hydraulic fracture design. An integrated approach towards addressing the concerns of all teams involved with the development of an asset will enhance the efficiency. The models used to simulate for reservoir development, completion as well as production require reliable inputs to enable meaningful results. The inputs required can be obtained from multiple sources; the results from lab based testing being the most direct method of actual measurement of required parameters. Lab studies are usually designed to satisfy the input requirements for multiple groups, and experimental programs, use at minimum, combinations of the tests shown in Table 1, to get the desired inputs towards designing the optimal solution for an encountered challenge or to anticipate and manage the challenge. The information shown includes dimensional requirements, with the ideal sample diameter being at least 10 times the average grain size (Bieniawski, Z.T., et al, 2007). Core sections obtained are usually slabbed or unslabbed sections of 7.62 cm diameter <U+00D7> 30.48 cm length. Well bore stability issues usually require a failure envelope study which consumes 3-4 samples worth of material per lithology from the core. Anisotropy studies which aid in wellbore stability analysis, bedding plane weakness studies as also hydraulic fracturing design require at least two samples to be drilled one parallel and the other perpendicular to the bedding. The material requirement estimate is dependent on successful representative drilling attempts and core condition.|","Document Type

The modeling tool combines a multiphase fluid flow and heat transport simulator, TOUGH2, with a geomechanical and fracture-damage modeling approach, called the rigid-body-spring network (RBSN). The model provides a discrete representation of material failure and fracture processes, and hydrological properties (e.g., permeability, porosity) of fractured elements are evaluated by transient fracture aperture changes. Modeling capabilities for coupled hydro-mechanical processes are presented through hydraulic fracturing simulations of laboratory test samples with multiple pre-existing natural fractures. Sensitivity studies are conducted by changing the reservoir configurations, such as the viscosity of injected fluid and the confining stress condition. More realistic reservoir modeling at a larger scale is conducted with configurations of mechanical anisotropy (e.g., elastic moduli, strength parameters), which demonstrates the capability of modeling directional fracturing paths aligned with anisotropic rock properties.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fluid-driven fractures are important in many geoengineering applications. For instance, hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used technique to increase the permeability of an oil/gas reservoir to enhance productivity. On the contrary, in the context of underground storage sites for radioactive waste or carbon dioxide, fractures induced by pressurized gas should be avoided or controlled to detain the pollutants.
Numerous numerical models have been developed to investigate the physical phenomena of fluid-driven fracture processes leading to a better understanding of the fracturing mechanism. However, it is still challenging to explicitly model fluid-driven fracturing because it involves tightly coupled hydro-mechanical (HM) behavior with a singularity at the crack tip. Especially in consideration of heterogeneous and anisotropic rock properties with presence of multiple fractures, modeling the fracture processes can be even more cumbersome.
In recent years, numerical studies have been conducted to model multiple fractures or fracture networks involved in coupled HM processes. Fu et al. (2013) proposed an explicit modeling approach for hydraulic fracturing in arbitrary discrete fracture networks. An adaptive remeshing (node-splitting) scheme within the finite-element based method was applied to demonstrate fracture generations. Pan et al. (2014) used a cellular automation coupled with a multiphase fluid flow simulator, TOUGH2 (Pruess et al., 2012), to represent multiple fracture interactions induced by CO2 injection. Asahina et al. (2014) established a coupling framework between the TOUGH2 simulator and the rigid-body-spring network (RBSN) approach, and validated the TOUGH-RBSN code through simulations of swelling and desiccation cracking in geomaterials. The simulation results proved the potential abilities to model multiple fractures and discrete fracture interactions.|","Document Type

The specimens were visually classified as smooth, slightly rough, moderately rough, rough, differentially weathered, and vuggy. Comparisons of roughness indices from the two methods were made using a graphical qualitative assessment and semi-quantitative assessments using Bland-Altman plots with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Profile roughness indices computed from laser profiling and photogrammetry methods compared favorably for smooth to rough weathering states. Profile roughness indices from using Sinuosity, Z2, Modified Division (a- and D-value), and Semi-Variance a-value did not compare favorably when assessing differentially weathered and vuggy profiles. Inspection of the profiles showed that photogrammetry profiles had segments containing high frequency perturbations which caused abnormally high roughness indices from the aforementioned algorithms. The perturbations are an artifact of the interpretation of the profiles obtained from specimen sections with pitted and vuggy surfaces. Care should be exercised when choosing profiling methods and assessing profile roughness when characterizing differentially weathered and vuggy specimens.
1. INTRODUCTION
The roughness of rock surfaces is of interest to many practitioners and researchers. Rock surface roughness is most often associated with shear strength estimates of discontinuities. Surface roughness can also be an indication of the degree of weathering. There have been many different methods used to assess or measure the surface of rock discontinuities or specimens. Perhaps the most widely used method is a visual assessment of the surface, viz. Barton and Choubey (1977), but many mechanical, contact, and non-contact methods have also been employed.
The choice of measurement method is dependent on a number of factors including both the desired resolution and the size of the surface to be analyzed. Techniques have ranged in sophistication from basic contact methods such as profile gauges (McCarrol, 1997) and needle probe profilometers (Ozvan et al, 2014 and Singh and Basu, 2016) to sophisticated non-contact methods such as charge coupled devices (Yang et al., 2016), variable focus microscope (Renger, 1970), multistripe laser triangulation scanning (Medapati et al., 2013), industrial laser profiling (Brown et al., 2016), photogrammetry (Kim et al., 2015), and LiDAR (Asmare et al., 2014). Poropat (2009) presents a number of different methods that have been used to assess the surface roughness of rock discontinuities.|","Document Type

Such approaches show promise for stimulating crystalline rocks, typical of geothermal reservoirs. However, many such target formations are at significant depths where pressures and temperatures induce a more ductile response that may inhibit the stimulation of an effective, permeable network. We present results from a computational effort to assess the feasibility of dynamic loading for creating a stimulated fracture network at depths approaching the brittle-ductile transition. We will discuss the spatial distribution of the developed fracture network for various P-T regimes. The results of this study are intended to support future experimental and/or field-based investigations and pave the way for a field demonstration of the dynamically stimulated geothermal process.
1. INTRODUCTION
In traditional hydraulic fracturing stimulation, the effective conductivity of low permeability rock is increased by generating/activating fractures through injection of pressurized fluid (Eaton, 1969; Simonson et al., 1978). One possible extension of traditional hydraulic fracturing is to increase the loading rate of the driving fluid. Methods that use dynamic loading potentially extend stimulation to previously unrealized geological resources (Reeves and Weida, 1995). With increasing rate of injection, such as achievable with explosives or propellants, it is possible to create fractures at arbitrary orientations and potentially stimulate the near wellbore region more uniformly (Reeves and Weida, 1995). Such an approach relies on the ability of stress waves from an explosive charge to overcome the in situ stresses and create fractures in various directions, in contrast to one preferentially aligned fracture formed during hydraulic fracturing in uniform rock. However, it is also well known that shock waves emanating from a detonation can compact the rock and reduce the permeability (Reeves and Weida, 1995).
In the case of geothermal applications in particular, there is a desire to seek greater depths to ensure sufficient heat for efficient energy extraction. For example, at depth of 3 km to 5 km we can expect the temperature to approach 500°C or more. Energetic approaches to stimulating a rock mass rely upon the creation of open fractures through brittle processes. Morris et al. (2016) applied shock-physics codes to investigate the near field, stress wave effects due to explosive stimulation. Their results confirmed that detonations may be used to stimulate the rock more uniformly in the near field of the explosion. In addition, they observed synergistic interactions among multiple charges. However, this previous work did not consider the impact of elevated temperature upon the strength and ductility of the rock. The motivation of the current study is to quantify the extent of brittle fracturing (that is more conducive to increased permeability) compared with ductile deformation at high temperature and pressure.|","Document Type

Natural weathering over the time and the poor cementation of the surrounding rock bodies have resulted in a lot of geological deterioration. In 1960s, Dunhuang Academy carried out the reinforcement project and took various measures including the construction of support walls and the removal of dangerous rocks to effectively prevent the cliff from further collapsing and provide a relatively stable environment for the preservation of the wall paintings in the caves. It is necessary to assess the effect of conservation project to ensure safety of caves after more fifties years. Based on comprehensive investigation of current condition of Mogao’s cliff and it's stability parameters, this study introduces the theory of risk management, assesses and classifies the stability risks of cliff by using different methods such as historical analysis, engineering geological analogy, limit equilibrium, numerical simulation and etc., and then reinforces the areas of high-level risks by anchoring, grouting or using protective capping. Meanwhile, more real-time monitoring measures have been used to ensure the security of the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Mogao Grottoes chiseled in the Quaternary conglomerate is located on the western bank of the Daquan River, 25 km southeast of Dunhuang city (Fig. 1).
Situated at a strategic point along the Silk Rood, at the crossroads of trade as well as religious, cultural and intellectual influences, the 735 cells and cave sanctuaries in Mogao are famous for their more 2000 statues and 45,000 m2 wall paintings, spanning 1,000 years of Buddhist art.
Due to the weak cemented cliff, natural weathering and human activities over 1000 years, multiple types of geological deteriorations have been appeared, such as cracks and collapses (Fig. 2). Frequent collapses happened in his history have caused terrible damage to the integrity of the caves. Meanwhile, the surface of cliff has become loosened and fragile by long-term deterioration. Especially in heavy weathering, gravels and sands often fall or slide down from the sloping area of the top of caves, seriously threatening the safety of the cultural heritage as well as visitors.|","Document Type

H., Spokane Mining Research Division| Larson, M. K., Spokane Mining Research Division","|ABSTRACT: Coal pillar bumps involve the sudden expulsion of coal and rock into the mine opening. Cleating is a type of joint system unique to coal seams. Cleat systems differ from adjacent joint systems in that they are pervasive throughout the coal seam, and are much more tightly spaced than joints that occur in other rock types. This study assumes that if elastic energy remains in the rock mass to a greater extent than plastic energy, the risk of pillar bursting would be increased proportionally to the energy ratio. In order to investigate and quantify the risk posed by this possible imbalance, a 3D finite difference code (the FLAC3D model) is used so that the elastic strain energy and dissipated plastic energy could be tracked for given zones in the model. Various orientations of cleat and applied stresses in the pillar are considered as input data and to determine the boundary conditions for the analysis. The results show the ratio of stored elastic energy to dissipated plastic energy.
1. INTRODUCTION
The type of catastrophic failure in coal mines known as dynamic failure—also colloquially referred to as bumps, bounces, bursts and others—is one of the most challenging and persistent engineering problems associated with coal mining in highly stressed conditions. Coal pillar bursts involve the sudden expulsion of coal and rock into the mine opening. These events occur when stresses in a coal pillar, left for support in underground workings, exceed the pillar’s critical capacity, causing the pillar to rupture without warning. These events can be exceptionally violent, ejecting coal and rock with explosive force.
As shown in Fig. 1, the decrease in the number and trend of fatalities in the mining industry from the early 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century, the U.S. coal industry has achieved significant improvement in the health and safety of underground coal miners. The number of coal mining fatalities has decreased from a high of several thousand annually to the recent lows which average below fifty per year.|","Document Type

V., University of Houston","|ABSTRACT: This study develops approximate solutions for the problems of a plane strain and radial hydraulic fractures that are generated by a time-varying injection source. The mathematical model considers coupling between the effects of fracture toughness, fluid viscosity (Newtonian fluid), and leak-off (Carter’s model). The solution is constructed by approximating spatial variation of the fracture width by a function, whose near-tip asymptotic behavior is captured precisely while the solution in the vicinity of the wellbore is approximated. Such an assumption together with the closed form expression for the asymptotic solution allows one to reformulate the problem in terms of algebraic equations, which leads to construction of the closed form approximate solutions. To examine the accuracy of the developed solutions, the latter are tested against the corresponding numerical solutions for a wide range of parameters. Results indicate a good agreement for both the plane strain and radial fracture geometries, thus enabling one to use the developed solutions to address problems where rapid computations of fracture parameters are necessary.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a technology that has been used to stimulate oil and gas wells for more than fifty years (Economides and Nolte, 2000). The fracturing fluid is injected deep into the subsurface to create cracks that increase the production of hydrocarbons by providing high conductivity channels. A typical hydraulic fracturing model includes flow of a viscous fluid inside the fracture, conservation of the fracturing fluid, elastic equilibrium of the rock, and a crack propagation criterion. There are many different models for hydraulic fracturing, which vary bp the fracture geometry, fracturing fluid rheology, and type of propagation criterion to name a few. Recent review papers contain more detailed descriptions oh various hydraulic fracture models (Adachi et al., 2007; Weng, 2015; Peirce, 2016).
Complex multiscale behavior of hydraulic fractures occurs even for the simplest geometries, namely, a semiinfinite plane strain, a finite plane strain, and a radial crack, see e.g. a thorough review paper (Detournay, 2016). In the situation, in which the problem is governed by the fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and leak-off, the complexity arises partly from the competition between the energy dissipation due to fracture toughness and fluid viscosity and partly from the possibility of fluid storage in either fracture or formation (most oh the fluid leaks off into the formation in this case). If a lag between the fluid and the fracture fronts is introduced, then it adds an additional parameter, namely the size of the fluid lag zone (Garagash and Detournay, 2000; Detournay and Garagash, 2003). If there is a possibility of a turbulent flow inside the fracture, then the size of the laminar zone near the tip plays the role of an additional parameter influencing the solution (Dontsov, 2016a). This study considers the case when the solution is determined solely by an interplay between the fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and leak-off and ignores the effects of the fluid lag and turbulent flow.|","Document Type

M., Sultan Qaboos University| Salimi, H., Curtin University","|ABSTRACT: Induced stresses are one of the main factors affecting wellbore instability and associated problems in drilling operations. These stresses are significantly impacted by pore pressure variation and thermal stresses in the fields. Heat and fluid transfer capability of rock and thermal expansion coefficient are important parameters in the study of stresses using a thermo-poroelastic model. In this study, the field equations governing the problem have been derived based on the thermo-poroelastic theory and solved analytically. Afterward, the couple of 50 mm synthetics sand-cement samples are applied in laboratory experiments. The in situ stresses and wellbore pressure are applied on the sample in a true triaxial stress cell (TTSC). In the laboratory tests, the temperatures are controlled and cooled oil is injected into the sample. The strains are measured and calculated based on experiment and model. In the next step, a genetic algorithm has been applied to solve an inverse problem and get a match between experimental data and the modeling results. Ultimately, the important properties for the interactions of fluid and rock can be estimated. With this approach, the required thermal and flow parameters are estimated with good accuracy without using time consuming and costly tests.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wellbore stability has an important role during drilling. The formations around wellbore experience new stress conditions due to the removal of drilled rocks (Fjaer, Horsrud et al. 2008, Al-Ajmi and Zimmerman 2009). Any point below ground carries different stresses, namely vertical stress due to the overburden or weight of overlaying formations, horizontal stresses from tectonic movements and pore pressures (Amadei 1984).
The assumed rock formation behavior is a significant factor in modeling the stresses around a borehole. In this regard, Mclean and Addis (Mclean and Addis 1990) pointed out that a poro-elasto-plastic model can give more realistic results than a linear elastic model. In addition, Bradford and Cook (1994) suggested using an elasto-plastic model for stress modeling and they have applied their recommendation in wellbore stability analysis for vertical well with isotropic in situ stresses. Furthermore, Chemo-poro-elastic model is used to determine the stresses around the wellbore in shale formations(Ma, Chen et al.).|","Document Type

This is especially true in the Coast Range Mountains of western British Columbia in Canada, where a number of tunnels have been planned for the coming years. This paper aims to provide guidance for the determination of in situ stress conditions in this complex environment through an assessment of the applicability of existing in situ stress methods and a review of previous project experience. The geological history of the area is presented to provide insight into the broad tectonic domain and allows general conclusions to be drawn regarding the state of stress in the region.
1. INTRODUCTION
The in situ stress magnitude and orientation are critical engineering parameters for evaluating the short and long term behaviour of an underground excavation. These parameters not only define the induced stresses around the excavation, but also have a significant impact on rockmass characterization and establishing probable failure mechanisms (either structurally or stress controlled). By understanding the in situ stress conditions, the expected extent of failure can also be assessed through analytical or numerical analysis techniques, which plays an important role in selecting an appropriate excavation orientation, excavation method and ground support system.
Observations from existing tunnels in the Coast Range Mountains (shown in Figure 1) have illustrated the importance of considering in situ stress primarily for two design cases: (1) for assessing the effects of relatively high in situ stress on ground stabilization during excavation, and (2) for assessing the extent of steel lining for hydraulic pressure tunnels. Case 1 is dominated by high stresses while Case 2 is dominated by low stresses. This paper focuses on Case 1 although some insight into Case 2 is also provided.|","Document Type

H., Mississippi State Uni.| Vahedifard, F., Mississippi State Uni.| Jelinek, B., Mississippi State University| Peters, J. F., Mississippi State University","|ABSTRACT: In this study, we use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to numerically simulate the micromechanics of frictional behavior of faults. Although fault zone widths can be tens of meters, the principal slip occurs within localized zones having widths of a few millimeters. Fault slip analysis is complicated by uncertainties in slip mechanics. Depending on rate and state of slip, the system can undergo weakening or strengthening, however the details of the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. The DEM can provide a robust modeling tool to capture many micromechanical features present within these fault slip zones that are beyond observation in physical experiments. In this work, we investigated the origin of the rate and state effects under various boundary conditions aiming to improve the representation of rate and state effects in larger-scale continuum analysis. Primary subject of this study is the relationship between stresses occurring at the particle scale and the constitutive response assumed in macro scale analyses.
1. INTRODUCTION
Observations have suggested that slip in faults, spanning tens of meter in length, can be extremely localized, occurring in a zone with a thickness of 1 to 5 mm (Rice, 2006). Studying this phenomenon has been commonly performed by understanding of macroscopic frictional properties and developing rate and state friction laws based on experimental observations (Lapusta, 2001). From these observations, the system can undergo strengthening or weakening depending on the rate and state effects on the system. Although these effects are small compared to the frictional strength of the system, they are very important in understanding the physical and mathematical properties in frictional sliding (Lapusta, 2001). Rice et al. (2014) used linearized stability analysis to study the extreme strain localizations and relate this to dilatancy and rate strengthening friction.
In this work, a micromechanical model is developed using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to capture the micromechanics involved in slip. Earlier work had been done using a two-dimensional (2D) DEM to model the rate and state effects of frictional sliding of granular fault gorge (Morgan, 2004). Also, modeling efforts have been performed in the area of gravitational volcanic deformation due to friction (Morgan, 2005). In this work, the three-dimensional (3D) DEM model is used to show how a system of plane-aligned particles can be used to model the slip characteristics observed from experimental data. The present DEM model extends the previous published work using the 3D DEM and provide further insight into micromechanics of the rate and state slip behavior.|","Document Type

The objective of the work is to explore the seepage effect on fracture network evolution during a tunnel excavation in a highly fractured rock mass based on fully coupled hydro-geomechanical modelling. An empirical joint constitutive model (JCM) that can capture the normal and shear behavior of rough fractures has been implemented in the combined finite-discrete element method (FEMDEM) code ‘Solidity’. Solidity can simulate the deformability of matrix blocks, the interaction of pre-existing fractures, and the propagation of new cracks driven by mode I, mode II or mixed mode brittle failure using nonlinear fracture mechanics in terms of a ‘smeared crack model’. The ‘JCM-Solidity’ model is further coupled to the multiphase flow solver ‘IC-FERST’ which is based on a CV-FEM formulation. This is achieved using a conservative mesh-to-mesh interpolation between solids and fluids, while forces are balanced using the novel ‘immersed body method’ for full two-way coupling. Anisotropic adaptive mesh refinement is used in the coupled domain to capture the fracture characteristics throughout the simulation. Thus, geomechanically-constrained hydraulically equivalent fracture apertures inform the local permeability for often highly refined fluids mesh elements within fractured regions of the porous rock mass, leak-off being automatically accommodated. Fluid flow is solved over the entire domain which represents the fractured system, with underlying details from the solid model. Coupled deformation, fracturing and flow processes can thus be captured by such a fully coupled solution scheme
1 INTRODUCTION
Tunnel construction in highly fractured, fluid saturated rock can often present hazards with potentially disastrous consequences. Fractures often dominate the strength (Hoek, 1983) and deformation properties (Kachanov, 1992) of geological formations; interconnected fractures can serve as conduits or barriers for fluid and chemical migration in subsurface space (Caine et al. 1996; Berkowitz 2002). Additionally, during the tunneling process, a draw-down of fluid level occurs as seepage flow towards the tunnel takes place (Anagnostou, 1995). Groundwater discharge into the tunnel, facilitated through fractures and joints, can often lead to failure of the tunnel walls, rising costs of containment and draining, and potential environment hazard. The ability to understand the impact of the coupled processes in such applications is a challenging issue, and can greatly improve the evaluation of risk associated tunnel excavation.|","Document Type

This technique is however highly dependent on the mechanical properties of the shale reservoir that is expected to be significantly varied with their rocks’ mineral composition. This study has therefore been aimed to examine the effect of various rock minerals on mechanical properties of shale formations through conducting a comprehensive experimental program. In order to replicate the composition of shales found in different regions, reconstituted specimens were produced from powdered minerals (quartz, feldspar, calcite, dolomite and kaolinite) with different compositions. Reconstituted specimens were tested for unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and splitting tensile strength after curing for 14 days. 38mm diameter and 76mm length specimens were used for the UCS tests, and 19mm diameter and 38mm length specimens were used for the splitting tensile strength. Findings from this study indicate increasing trend of UCS with the increasing of kaolinite and calcite percentages. Same kind of relationship was observed for the splitting tensile strength as well. Moreover, results show an increasing trend of UCS with increasing density. Interestingly, results indicate a decreasing trend of UCS with the increasing of quartz percentage, which was not expected in this study.
1. INTRODUCTION
With increasing demand for energy, the need for better alternative solutions to conventional fossil fuels has arisen. In the United States (US), there has been a recent surge in the amount of natural gas extracted from shale gas plays. This can be attributed to the rapid advancement in hydraulic fracturing or ‘fracking’ technologies.
Hydraulic fracturing has been developed as a means to efficiently release the natural gas trapped within an almost impermeable reservoir rocks (approximately 10-1000<U+03BC>d) (Miller et al, 2011). Hydraulic fracturing involves initially drilling vertically until a shale gas reservoir is reached at approximately 1-5km, at that point, the well is turned and horizontal drilling takes place. Once the well is in place, and surrounding aquifers have been sufficiently protected using well casing, hydraulic fracturing can begin. Hydraulic fracturing begins with injecting a ‘fracturing fluid’ at high pressures into the horizontal well. This causes the shale to break and form a network of fractures. In most cases, the fracture network created greatly increases the permeability of the shale formations, promoting the flow of gas. The gas is then able to diffuse into the wellbore, once the fracking fluid is pumped back to the surface (Wanniarachchi, 2017). The fracking fluid consists of a liquid, gas, foam or energized fluid that is mixed with ‘proppants’ such as sand, bauxite or ceramic which is used to hold fractures opened even after releasing the fracturing pressure, as well as chemical additives which enhance the efficiency of the fracturing process. The gas is then allowed to diffuse into the wellbore, which is then extracted and processed.|","Document Type

A., KFUPM| Al-AbdulJabbar, A., Saudi Aramco","|ABSTRACT: Rate of Penetration (ROP) is defined as the volume of rock removed per unit area (ft) per unit time (hrs). There are several published models to predict the rate of penetration; however, most of them focus on drilling parameters such as: string revolutions per minute, weight on bit, pumping rate. Only few researchers focused on the effect of mud properties and their influence on the rate of penetration values using few or little data. The objective of this paper is to develop a new model to predict the ROP based on both the drilling parameters and mud properties using artificial intelligent techniques (ANN). Actual field measurements of more than 3333 data points of different parameters were used to build an empirical ROP model. The obtained results showed that ANN model can be used to predict the ROP with a high accuracy (correlation coefficient of 0.99 and an average absolute percentage error of 5.6%). It is very important to combine both the mechanical parameters and the drilling fluid properties to predict the ROP. The developed ANN model for estimating the ROP outperformed all of the previous available correlations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rate of Penetration (ROP) is defined as the volume of rock removed per unit area (ft) per unit time (hrs). It also can be referred as the speed of breaking the rock under the bit. In general, it measures the speed or the progress of the bit when it drills the formation (Bourgoyne and Millheim, 1986). Faster ROP values are always consider good signs since they result in faster delivery of the well and thus saving time and money. However, too fast ROP may result in hole problems and poor hole cleaning that can extend the duration of well delivery and introduce much more complications such as losing part of the BHA in the hole due to formation instability and collapse (Akgun, 2002).|","Document Type

Therefore, the in-situ stresses are essential input parameters for all geomechanical analyses, regardless of the complexity of the problem. The determination of in-situ stresses should include both the magnitude and direction of all the principal stress components. An accurate estimation of the in-situ stress field is a prerequisite for a robust and reliable geomechanical analysis.
In this work, an integrated approach is used to constrain both minimum and maximum horizontal stresses (including both magnitude and direction) by using the data from a single well. Within the framework, the combination of fracture injection test and image log analysis is used to constrain and calibrate the in-situ stress components and minimize uncertainties.
Using the proposed workflow, a series of geomechanical analyses is performed to quantify the impact of in-situ stress uncertainty in geomechanical modeling and analysis used in different design applications. The geomechanical analyses include critically stressed fracture analysis, hydraulic fracture modeling (i.e., near wellbore initiation and far-field propagation), and discrete fracture network reactivation (i.e., induced micro-seismicity).
The analysis confirms that by using the integrated stress-field-determination approach, the uncertainty of in-situ stress magnitude and direction can be reduced and the reliability of geomechanical model predictions can be enhanced. The accurately constrained in-situ stress field could be utilized in different geomechanical models and analysis—including wellbore stability, hydraulic fracturing, wellbore placement, depletion-/injection-induced stress changes, and corresponding production forecast—to improve the overall efficiency of the field operations and development.
1. INTRODUCTION
During exploration, stimulation and production, in-situ stress field is routinely monitored, measured and used in the oil and gas industry. The in-situ stress field is composed of three principal components (vertical and two horizontal components). The vertical stress is generated by the gravity of the overburden rock. The two horizontal components are caused by the Poisson effect and poroelastic deformation of the confined formation upon the overburden loading acting on top of the target layer or zone. The tectonic forces acting on the perimeter of the formation could change and even make the in-situ stress condition more complex. As a result of the regional tectonic activities and reservoir heterogeneity, the magnitudes of the two horizontal components are usually unequal, the difference between which is termed as stress anisotropy in horizontal direction.|","Document Type

As China is a mountainous country, the powerhouses for hydropower stations are constructed mainly by underground excavation. Stability of underground openings under different conditions is an important issue in construction (Zhu et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2015; Meng et al., 2016). Numerical simulation has been become an important method to solve the rock mechanics problem of this kind of engineering, while how to choose a suitable numerical method is a crucial stage. Rock mass is largely Discontinuous, Anisotropic, Inhomogeneous, Not-Elastic (DAINE), (Harrison and Hudson, 2000). In underground excavated in jointed rock masses at relatively shallow depth, the most common types of failure are those involving wedges falling from the roof or sliding out of the sidewalls of the openings (Hoek, 2007). If the stability of rock mass has a close relationship with the discontinuity, discontinuous method is indispensable and continuum method will not get a reasonable answer (Jing, 2003).
A discontinuous medium is distinguished from a continuous medium by the existence of interfaces or contacts between the discrete bodies that comprise the system. The Distinct Element Method (DEM) is one of significant discontinuous medium methods. The formulation and development of the method have progressed for a period of over 46 years, beginning with the initial presentation by Cundall (1971). Although the DEM has been used most extensively in academic environments to date, it is finding its way into the offices of consultants, planners and designers.|","Document Type

J., University of Wisconsin-Madison","|ABSTRACT: We investigate the time-dependent deformational properties of fractured rocks in order to evaluate the apparent creep behavior of such rocks and understand the relevant physical mechanisms responsible for such behavior. Rocks surrounding subsurface structures and natural fault zones are densely fractured due to the damage induced by the stress concentrations around each structures. These abundant fractures may serve as independent slip planes within the rock, depending on its frictional properties and hydrothermal conditions, potentially allowing the bulk rock to behave apparently as a ductile medium. Accurate prediction of such behavior may be crucial when assessing the long-term stability of these underground structures and the stress state around faults. We conducted triaxial creep experiments using thermally-fractured granite rocks. Westerly granite samples were heated to a maximum temperature up to 600 degrees Celsius to produce analogues of damaged crystalline rocks with varying degree of fracture densities. Measured index properties of these rock samples and microstructure observations show that fracture densities were successfully varied according to the maximum temperature reached during heating. Laboratory data shows that the samples exhibit substantial amount of time-dependent deformation when constant isotropic or anisotropic stresses are applied even under dry and room temperature conditions.
1. INTRODUCTION
Underground openings are accompanied by rock mass with enhanced damage surrounding the structure known as excavation damage zones. Upon excavation of the original rock formation, stress concentrations develop along the periphery of the opening at certain locations depending on the geometry, and some normal stresses are also released close to the opening due to the newly created free surface. Such local perturbation in the stress state causes the failure of the surrounding rock mass by newly created fractures and opening of pre-existing fractures.
Damaged rock masses also develop by natural causes around fault structures. Rock masses surrounding a fault accumulates damage as faults mature due to coalescence and interaction of micro-/macro-fractures, and stress concentrations occurring at fault tips (process zone), dynamic rupture fronts (pulverization), and geometrical irregularities (Mitchell and Faulkner, 2009). Micro- and macro-fracture densities decline with distance away from the fault and eventually become identical to the host rock (Johri et al., 2014; Mitchell and Faulkner, 2009). This damaged region is referred to as the damage zone as opposed to the fault core which comprise the very fault plane.|","Document Type

S., The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)| Tulu, I. B., The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)| Bajpayee, T. S., The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)","|ABSTRACT: Stress-driven instability of roof rocks in coal mine entries can result in large roof falls with associated safety hazards. Failure may be related to spalling, cutter formation, and delamination of bedding of the roof strata. The mode of failure is similar to failure of brittle rocks observed in hard rock environments. Additionally, coal mine roof rocks and coal materials can exhibit brittle failure characteristics when tested in the laboratory. A brittle failure criterion that considers both extensional fracturing under low confinement as well as shear failure under increased confinement is applied in numerical models of coal mine entries. The results show that such models can replicate field-monitored rock mass deformations and depths of failure. The results further show that the predicted zone of extension failure resembles the “softening zone” that is described in coal mine roof support literature. The authors conclude that modeling the presence of a reduced strength extension failure zone produces a satisfactory simulation of rock response around coal mine entries.
1. INTRODUCTION
Roof instability is a leading cause of injuries and fatalities in underground coal mines. Each year more than 400 reportable roof-fall events occur in coal mines in the United States (MSHA, 2016). Improved understanding of the rock failure mechanics and development of methods to evaluate likely rock mass response for given geologic conditions can assist in designing ground support systems. Observations of rock damage and roof failures in the bedded roof of coal mines demonstrate that brittle spalling and delamination of beds contribute to the onset and propagation of roof instability (Hill 1986, Gadde and Peng 2005, Hasenfus and Su 2006). The mode of rock failure is observed to be similar to the extension-type brittle fractures encountered in hard rock excavations under low confinement described by Stacey (1980), Martin et al. (1997), Diederichs (2003), and others.|","Document Type

J., Lyles School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University","|ABSTRACT: In the laboratory, uniaxial compression experiments were performed on prismatic specimens of Indiana limestone with two pre-existing parallel flaws. Full waveform measurements of shear waves were used to monitor shear crack initiation and propagation in rock. Simultaneously, digital image correlation (DIC) was used to monitor the damage evolution on the specimen surface by measuring full-field displacements. The shear cracks that initiated from the flaws tips that ultimately produced coalescence were observed to propagate roughly parallel to the loading direction such that the waves impinged on the crack plane at normal incidence. The amplitude of the transmitted waves did not change significantly with shear crack initiation. However, shear to compressional wave conversions occurred when a shear crack was initiated, roughly at 76% of the load detected with DIC. The wave conversion is associated with micro-cracks generated as the shear crack initiates. The amplitude of the converted waves increased with shear crack growth and reached a maximum at coalescence. Observation of converted waves provides a means for monitoring shear cracks, given that past research has shown that transmitted waves were not sensitive to shear crack initiation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Discontinuities play an important role in the behavior and stability of the rock mass, as well as in the flow of fluids through the rock. Discontinuities occur on different scales, from micro-cracks to fractures and faults. Given the role that pre-existing and induced discontinuities have in rock mass behavior, it is critical to develop techniques that can be used to identify and characterize fractures inside the rock, as well as their evolution with stress changes or with time.
Several investigators have shown that seismic methods can be used to monitor or even predict rock mass behavior. They have shown that local and microscopic changes of the physical properties of the rock matrix and of the discontinuities affect seismic characteristics such as amplitude and velocity (Pyrak-Nolte et al., 1990, Chen et al., 1993, Pyrak-Nolte, 1996, Nakagawa et al., 2000, Kahraman, 2002, Leucci and De Giorgi, 2006, Shao and Pyrak-Nolte, 2013, Byun et al., 2015). Transmitted and reflected compressional (P) and shear (S) waves have been used in our previous work to identify the evolution of tensile and shear cracks inside the rock. The experimental results consistently show that changes in the amplitudes of transmitted seismic waves can be used for detection of damage evolution in the form of tensile cracks, but cannot identify the initiation of shear cracks (Modiriasari et al., 2015).|","Document Type

One of the mechanisms of open borehole instability is a failure caused by the eroding action of drilling fluid in the annulus, called borehole erosion. The shear stress and lifting force mobilized on the formation and the impact of cuttings at the rock grains lead to detachment of formation grains and enlargement of the borehole. This failure is more critical when a turbulent regime is imposed in the annulus in a small gap between the drill string and the formation, which is usually the case during coiled tube drilling. While bore hole erosion, further cutting contamination can also occur from the borehole erosion, which is particularly important for the new drilling system being developed by the Deep Exploration Technologies Cooperative Research Centre (DET CRC) for mineral exploration use. This paper aims to review existing experiments of soil or rock erosion and to introduce new experimental setup for borehole erosion study.
1. INTRODUCTION
Borehole instability is a condition where the drilled section loses its structural integrity and the borehole remains out of gauge (McLean & Addis, 1990). Borehole instability has been a challenge for drilling, where it causes a decrease in drilling efficiency, pipe sticking and fluid loss. Instability can be initiated through three different mechanisms:
Structure controlled, where the discontinuities around the wellbore control stability e.g. planar, wedge failure.|Stress-controlled, causing localised plastic behaviour which leads to a failure around the wellbore.|Chemical reaction, where the fluid content in rock mass changes the rock properties causing instabilities such as swelling of shale rock.|Fluid flow/rock interaction in which the fluid flow through the borehole or discontinuities exerts drag or lift forces on the formation and causes erosion.","Document Type

W., University of Wyoming| Poudel, R., University of Wyoming| Kyle, W., University of Wyoming| Tan, G., University of Wyoming| Podgorney, R., Idaho National Laboratory","|ABSTRACT: With the growing interest in renewable energy resources, geothermal energy has become an important research topic. The research objective is to develop a more cost-effective laboratory-scale experimental setup than a full-scale field system to understand the effects of temperature alteration on 1) the thermal-hydro-mechanical interaction between a solid and fluid, and 2) the wellbore stability as a result of geothermal energy extraction. The proposed setup consisted of a steel pipe network, five concrete slabs to simulate a rock mass with two controlled horizontal discontinuities and two wellbores. Water was circulated using a water bath into the injection wellbore, through two continuities and out of the simulated reservoir from the extraction wellbore. The concrete slabs were heated and heavily instrumented with vibrating-wire sensors to measure the changes in strains, pore water pressures, and temperatures. Water circulated through the reservoir was measured for flow rate, pressure and temperature. Also, an overburden pressure was applied to the slabs to simulate actual overburden soil and rock. The workability of the laboratory-scale experimental setup for the geothermal energy investigation was confirmed.
1. INTRODUCTION
With the growing national and international interest in alternative energy resources, geothermal energy has attracted more research attentions, especially in the west region of the United States, where many abundant geothermal resources are yet to be explored. Geothermal energy is gaining more supports throughout the world, because it is an affordable and environmentally friendly source of heat (Lofken 2013). Enhanced geothermal system (EGS) is a man-made geothermal reservoir with hot dry rock and insufficient or little natural permeability or fluid saturation. Fluid is normally injected into the geothermal reservoir through hydraulic stimulation or fracturing.
In order to develop this resource, it is also important to understand the effects of temperature alteration on wellbore stability as a result of geothermal energy extraction and application. Wellbore stability is usually caused by a combination of uncontrollable and controllable factors, and temperature is considered as a controllable factor (Mohiuddin et al. 2001). Most past studies were focused on the effects of drilling fluid temperatures on the wellbore stability and how mud temperatures were controlled to keep wellbore stress concentration within the surrounding rock limiting strength. Knowledge gained from past studies can be applied in this study to investigate the thermal effects on the geomechanical and hydraulic characteristics of wellbores and geothermal reservoir. Fundamental knowledge of the relationship between the permeability of a geothermal reservoir and the thermal expansion and contraction of geomaterials will improve our understanding of thermal-hydro-mechanical problems.|","Document Type

Because of reduction in pore pressure, the far-field stresses change. Consequently, formation fracture pressure decreases and therefore the safe mud window becomes narrower. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to predict horizontal in-situ stress changes during production and injection. Most often, it is assumed that a reservoir deforms uniaxially and the overburden stress is constant during production and injection. However, measured stress paths in the lab under these conditions have large discrepancies with field stress measurements from fracturing tests. These discrepancies might be due to several factors such as scale effects, damaged cores, stress arching, and faulting contributions. However, we identified that another controlling parameter is the dominant boundary conditions in the reservoir. A test matrix is designed and several laboratory experiments are conducted on Caslegate sandstone specimens using a triaxial facility. The depletion and injection tests were performed under uniaxial-strain, plane-strain, generalized-plane-stress, and unconstrained conditions. According to the results, stress paths during pressure drawdown and build-up stages are different and a permanent stress change is observed during production and injection cycles in all boundary conditions. Interestingly, the permanent stress change is highest for those BC’s where the lateral deformation is permissible (e.g., plane strain, generalized plane stress, and unconstrained conditions). In fact, the stress changes during production are irrecoverable upon repressurization for these cases. According to results, depletion-induced horizontal stress changes under plane strain and unconstrained conditions are lower than generalized-plane-stress assumptions. The highest change in horizontal in-situ stress is for the case of uniaxial strain condition.
1. INTRODUCTION
In-situ stresses in the reservoir control mechanical, petrophysical, and strength properties as wells as fracture pressure and deformational behavior of reservoir and surrounding formations (Teufel et al., 1991). Furthermore, conducting any wellbore and reservoir geomechanical analysis is significantly sensitive to the accuracy of in-situ stresses in the reservoir. Consequently, knowledge of in-situ stresses is critical for accurate prediction of reservoir response under various loading conditions. On the other hand, field measurement of in-situ stresses via fracturing tests during the life of reservoir reveal that the far field stresses change as the reservoir becomes increasingly depleted due to stress and pore pressure coupling (Teufel, 1991; Tuefel et al., 1996; Addis, 1997; Wu and Addis, 1998; Santarelli et al., 1998; Hettema, 2000; Chan and Zoback., 2002). Zoback (2007) pointed out that fracture initiation pressure (FIP) during a leak-off test is a strong function of in-situ stresses and also the fracture propagation pressure (FPP) is very close to the minimum horizontal stress. This implies that any changes of in-situ stresses will alter the fracture initiation pressure and fracture propagation pressure. Specifically, in oil and gas drilling industry, the changes in fracture pressure significantly affects the safe drilling margin and therefore improper design of mud weight without taking into account the changes of in-situ stresses will lead to loss circulation of drilling fluid and increasing Non-Productive-Time (NPT) of drilling operation. This is of special importance in deep-water wells, which the fracture pressure of reservoir is low even prior to depletion. Moreover, induced stress changes during production from or injection into reservoirs may cause sand production, casing collapse, compaction and subsidence, and reactivation of pre-existing faults and induced-seismicity (Segall, 1985, 1989; Morita et al., 1989; Santarelli et al., 1998; Hettema, 2000; Hillis, 2001; Holt et al., 2004; Lynch et al, 2013; Rafieepour et al, 2015, 2017). The earlier analytical solutions were based on the theory of poroelasticity. For example, Aadnoy (1991) developed the following equation for the horizontal stress change as a function of pore pressure
(equation)
This equation was obtained based on uniaxial strain assumption and relates the stress path to the Poisson's ratio and Biot-Willis coefficient. Consequently, the fracture initiation pressure after depletion changes as follows
(equation)
Similar derivations were developed by Addis (1997a) for transversely isotropic and Shahri et al. (2013) for orthotropic materials.|","Document Type

T., University of Oklahoma| Damani, A., University of Oklahoma| Sondergeld, C., University of Oklahoma| Rai, C. S., University of Oklahoma","|ABSTRACT: The concept of Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) has spawned numerous reservoir engineering models to approximate the production mechanisms associated with complex hydraulic fractures and to facilitate production modeling and well performance evaluations.
There have been various methods to quantify SRV, both in laboratory and in field. Micro-seismic monitoring is widely applied in both scales. The technique records the acoustic emission associated with fracture propagation and shear activation. The data acquisition only lasts during these phases, and the evaluation is not repeatable. Determining SRV from micro-seismic faces some major challenges due to noise-signal processing and attenuation. Although some other methods, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) provide detailed SRV characterization, they are applicable only in very small scale. SEM is only suitable for laboratory observation. In this study, we use shear wave attributes to evaluate SRV. This association can also be utilized in field. The concept is not new to seismic assessment. In fact, directional shear wave has been used to determine natural fracture orientation. However, we present this concept for SRV monitoring purposes, and demonstrate its capabilities on la experiment. The experiments were initially done with a Tennessee sandstone core before and after being hydraulically fractured under triaxial laboratory condition (<U+03C3>1 = 3000 psi; <U+03C3>2 = 2000 psi; <U+03C3>3 = 500 psi; Pinj = 4500 psi). Shear wave travel time have been recorded with polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the direction of maximum stress.
As expected, shear velocity is slower across the main fracture. However, the effect is emphasized on the right wing. Shear velocity is also slower when it propagates perpendicular to the main fracture. This agrees with what has been observed by SEM image, in which secondary fractures are parallel to the main fracture.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is an important application for an economical production of hydrocarbons from unconventional formations. It constitutes a significant contribution to the well development cost. There are arguments that state that the physical laws governing fractures are known and fracture models are accurate, but the emergence of ‘new mechanisms’ every few years suggests that the basic physics incorporated into models has not been as comprehensive as required to model a fracture fully (Warpinsky, 1996).|","Document Type

H., Sichuan University| Zhu, J. B., The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","|ABSTRACT: How to rapidly and accurately determine joint normal stiffness in rock mass is an important issue in rock engineering. In this work, a new method, i.e., the rapid evaluation method, was introduced to determine the normal stiffness of joints. This method was derived from one-dimensional compressional wave propagation theory. The effect of joints on wave propagation is modelled by displacement discontinuity model as a boundary condition in solving wave equations. Together with input parameters from laboratory or field ultrasonic tests, joint normal stiffness was inversely determined. Direct measurements of joint normal stiffness were performed from uniaxial compression tests. The joint normal stiffness predicted by the rapid evaluation method was then compared with that from direct laboratory measurements. The results show that joint stiffness determined from the rapid evaluation method agreed with their corresponding experimental values, which confirms that this proposed method is valid and feasible.
1. INTRODUCTION
Joints, which distribute widely and range in a variety of size in rock mass, have a significant impact on the mechanical and seismic behaviors of rock mass. The joint normal stiffness, one of vital mechanical properties of rock joints, is equal to the axial stress divided by the corresponding deformation of joint. Determining joint normal stiffness is significant in applied geophysics, rock mechanics, and earthquake engineering.
So far, a large number of researchers have proposed different methods to calculate the normal stiffness of joints from different aspects. After summarizing these methods, we found they can be classified into two main categories. The first category is laboratory or field measurement (Goodman 1976; Olsson and Barton, 2001). Although accurate normal stiffness of joints can be acquired from laboratory or field tests, this method can damage rock mass irreversibly and sampling process to obtain highly qualified jointed rock samples is not an easy job. The second one is empirical estimation according to joint characteristics (Barton, 1976; Bandis et al., 1983; Jaeger et al., 2007). The drawback of the second method is that it greatly depends on professional skill of geologists and civil engineers.|","Document Type

Fractal theory has a unique advantage in studying the microstructure of rocks, which can be used to study the influence of drilling fluid on shale strength characteristics. Shale samples obtained from western South China Sea field have been tested using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) tests, nitrogen adsorption (NA) tests, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) tests, uniaxial compressive strength tests to study the impact of drilling fluid on shale. The results indicate the total porosity along with the percentage of micro-pores increased, and the calculated fractal dimension increased as follow, meanwhile uniaxial compressive strength gradually reduced due to immersing shale. At the same time, the SEM results show that the number and size of micro-cracks increased and more corrosion holes appeared. Shown by the experimental results, the fractal dimension is positively correlated with the micro-cracks and inversely correlated with shale uniaxial compressive strength. Accordingly, the drilling fluid formulation is optimized to lower the fractal dimension of shale, by which the decrease in shale rock strength is significantly lowered.
1. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of the world economy, the oil and gas resources demand increase significantly. However, the scale of the land resources discovered gradually is reducing, and the difficulty of the land resources explored gradually is magnifying. So the industry focuses on the offshore resources. Nevertheless, successful and sustainable development of the offshore reservoir is still faced with a set of drilling and operational challenges [1]. The oil and gas reserves are of high abundance in the western South China Sea fields. When drilling through hard-brittle shale formation of great depth, the drilling cost will be significantly increased because of frequent and complicated downhole situations such as the sticking and wellbore breakout [2]. After the long time immersing in the drilling fluid, the physical and chemical properties of shale formations must be changed to some extent, thus may be affecting the shale strength characteristics. The contents of mineral components and the microstructure greatly influence the shale strength characteristics [3]. Drilling fluid can invade along with a fracture network into formation, and can increase pore pressure of the fracture network to form a local high pressure zone. At the same time, drilling fluids require to maintain an alkaline condition to enhance the emulsion stability. However, alkali can corrode clay minerals and quartz [4], which plays significant roles in triggering fracture generation and propagation, and wellbore instability.|","Document Type

Retrieving reservoir rock samples throughout the depth of the reservoir section and performing laboratory tests on them are extremely expensive as well as time consuming. Therefore, mostly UCS predicted from empirical correlations. Most of the empirical correlations for UCS prediction are based on elastic parameters or on compressional wave velocity. These correlations were developed using linear or non-linear regression techniques. This paper presents a rigorous empirical correlation based on the weights and biases of Artificial Neural Network to predict UCS. The testing of new correlation on real field data gave a less error between actual and predicted data, suggesting that the proposed correlation is very robust and accurate. Therefore, the developed correlation can serve as handy tool to help geo-mechanical engineers in order to determine the UCS.
1. INTRODUCTION
UCS defines the strength of the rock when subjected to uniaxial loading. Under unconfined conditions, it is the maximum axial compressive stress that a perfectly right-cylindrical sample of material can withstand. UCS has been used widely in petroleum industry to estimate the in-situ stresses of the rock, to make geo-mechanical earth model, to optimize of rate of penetration in drilling and to design optimal hydraulic fracture parameters in production (Gatens et al., 1990). Accurate prediction of UCS can avoid severe drilling problems which includes well bore collapse, hole pack off, sand production and tight holes (Khaksar et al., 2009).
UCS can be determined by means of static methods. These methods are uniaxial and tri-axial compressional tests, which are conducted on a right cylindrical cores retrieved from the depth of the interest. These tests measure the deformation of rock sample by the application of known force (Barree et al., 2009). The stress-strain deformation curves are generated from these tests. These curves are traced and analyzed to obtain UCS as well as elastic parameters (Jaegar et al., 2007).|","Document Type

Z., University of Texas at Austin","|ABSTRACT: Fluid injection has become a common practice to improve reservoir performance of ultra-heavy oil sand reservoirs in the Karamay, northwest China. At present, a lack of understanding of the wettability of the oil sands precludes the engineers from characterizing the efficiency of fluid injection in water or steam-flood practices. In this regard, experiments including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tests were conducted on specimens sampled from field-collected oil sand cores. Three specimens prepared with pressure values at 0, 1 and 2MPa were tested for their NMR responses and contact angles. The NMR experiments were carried out to obtain the transverse relaxation time (T2) curve of the specimens in order to analyze the nature of the liquid with which the solid grains are in contact with. The contact angle tests were to examine the water film formation on the grain and bitumen surfaces. It was found that the Karamay oil sand tends to be water-wet under water injection practices. Moreover, as the differential pressure increases, the extent of wetting strengthens in terms of having more water enter the pores of multiple scales and forming thicker water films on the grain surfaces.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wettability can influence a variety of important reservoir properties such as relative permeability and residual oil saturation, therefore have a significant impact on the ultimate heavy oil recovery. At present, water (brine) injection has been frequently adopted in field practices to stimulate the reservoir in order to improve its performance during the subsequent stages (Yuan et al. 2011a&b, Yuan et al. 2013, Zhang et al. 2016, Lin et al. 2016&2017). The efficiency of injection is especially dependent on the wettability of the oil sand.
The investigation on the wettability of oil sand is different from the corresponding research in shale or sandstone because of their differences in mineralogical composition. Specially, heavy oil (bitumen) acts as cement in an oil sand matrix rather than merely occupying the pore space. For this reason, the oil sand matrix was examined in this study on its wettability using oil sand cylindrical specimens saturated with brine.|","Document Type

The quasi-static DEM model, which is constructed by Delaunay tessellation of the rock volume, considers rock fabric heterogeneities by using the “disordered” DEM mesh and adding random perturbations to the stiffness and tensile/shear strengths of individual DEM elements and the elastic beam between them. A conjugate 3D flow network based on DEM lattice is constructed to calculate the fluid flow in both the fracture and porous matrix. One distinctive advantage of the DEM model is that fracturing is naturally described by the breakage of elastic beams between DEM elements. It is also extremely convenient to introduce mechanical anisotropy into the model by simply assigning orientation-dependent tensile/shear strengths to the elastic beams.
1. INTRODUCTION
Enhanced geothermal system (EGS) energy production relies on the ability to create fractures with desired size, aperture, orientation and connectivity, which in turn depend on understanding of fracture propagation mechanisms, knowledge of subsurface stress conditions, rock properties, formation permeability and design of operational strategies such as wellbore placement and injection rate, fracture fluid properties, etc. The difficultly of characterizing these properties and monitoring fracture geometry evolution currently limits the development of advanced adaptive control of fractures for permeability management. In order to address those challenges and uncertainties of subsurface energy-related processes involving fracturing and permeability enhancement, earth scientists from several national laboratories and three universities have carried out a $1.35 M project to develop a new underground facility called kISMET (permeability (k) and Induced Seismicity Management for Energy Technologies) at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota.|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Stability problems such as rockburst under high stress environment are of prime concerns during underground excavations. Aydan and his group performed a series of tests on minerals and rocks ranging from soft to hard, which showed distinct heat releases before the rupture (Aydan et al. 2014, 2015). This fact implied that infrared camera thermography should be of some value for assessing hot spots at the excavation face, which may result in pop-ups, spalling or rockbursting.

The objective of this study is to quantify the effect of rock mechanical on the risk of induced seismicity. As pore pressure increases in a storage reservoir, the state of stress in both the reservoir and surrounding formations is altered. Conventional analytical solutions used to predict the reservoir stress path assume that deformation occurs only in the vertical direction. Several studies have shown that this is a good assumption if the lateral extent of the pressurized region is much greater than the vertical extent and the shear modulus of the reservoir and cap rock are similar. These results assumed a spatially uniform pore pressure, which is not realistic for most cases. A new coupled simulator was used to parametrically study these effects. The results indicate that the conventional uniaxial strain assumption predicts smaller changes in stress than are predicted by the coupled model. This means that the uniaxial strain assumption is not conservative from the perspective of induced seismicity and other geomechanical risk factors. It is also shown that, for the cases studied, a higher caprock shear modulus produces smaller reductions in horizontal effective stresses, which would indicate a smaller risk of induced seismicity in normal faulting and strike-slip regimes.
1 INTRODUCTION
Subsurface reservoirs are believed to be capable of safely storing hundreds of years’ worth of anthropogenic CO2. Potential subsurface storage reservoirs that have been proposed include depleted petroleum reservoirs, saline aquifers, un-minable coal seams, and basalt formations. In nearly all cases, storing CO2 in these formations will cause increases in pore pressures and associated changes in stresses that have the potential to cause several negative impacts, including induced seismicity and damage to the sealing capacity of overlying formations.
For geologic carbon storage (GCS) to become widely employed, methods must be developed to assess and manage the risks associated with these potential impacts. To assess these risks it is necessary to estimate the initial state of stress, and how the stresses will evolve over time during and after active injection.|","Document Type

A., TNO - Applied Geoscience","|ABSTRACT: Geothermal energy, with its combination of very low CO2 emission rates and the possibility of providing electricity, has the potential of being a key factor in the global greenhouse gas emission reduction. Some geothermal systems, however, require stimulation to achieve economic production. To simulate the effectiveness of stimulation techniques, a synergy between dynamic flow simulators and geomechanical models is crucial. Especially in volcanic environments. Such systems are characterized by a high fracture density, fluids are generally stored in the pores of the rock mass, but the fracture network, rather than the connectivity of the pores, provides the conduits for fluids and heat to flow through the reservoir. Injecting fluid alters the stress field in the area. If the induced extra pressure is larger than the rock strength, it propagates tensile fractures in the rock, enhancing the conductivity and permeability. For smaller pressures, the reduction of the effective stress might cause hydro-shearing of existing fractures. Moreover, injecting fluid colder than the in situ temperature will generate thermal stresses, with similar effect on the fractures. To tackle all those aspects, we linked numerical simulators and analytical solutions to connect the evolving fluid properties and temperature with the changes in the stress field. |1.

However, to achieve economic production, geothermal systems often need to be stimulated. The stimulation techniques aim to improve the permeability and connectivity of the geothermal system.

We assume that the expression of Particle Size Distribution (PSD) in a crushed sample is a function of a fractal distribution and a uniform distribution. This allows calculating the breakage parameter, the increase of surface energy, and finally the energy dissipated by breakage. By summing the contact energy at all the contacts within a sample, we calculate the elastic energy stored. The calculation of friction-dissipated energy requires calculating relative movements of contacts, which are highly unpredictable especially when crushing is involved. Thus we include the dissipation that results from the relative displacement of grains in contact (including both crushed fragments and surrounding intact grains) in the friction-dissipated energy. We obtain the friction-dissipated energy by subtracting the elastic energy stored in the grains and the breakage energy from the input energy. The results show that the energy distribution is stress sensitive and changes a lot with the increase of compressive stress. Energy dissipation by friction plays a major role during confined comminution.
1. INTRODUCTION
Quasi-static confined comminution is a mechanical process in which particle sizes decrease due to high compressive stress. This method is encountered in civil engineering, powder technology and the mineral industry. During this comminution, the total input energy (<U+03B4>W) at the boundary is transformed into elastic energy stored in grains, breakage energy, friction energy and redistribution energy - the dissipation of the kinetic energy triggered by crushing (McDowell, 1996; Nguyen and Einav,2009; Russell and Einav, 2013). The complete energy balance equation is given by (Russell, 2011):

The Marble Shear is a thin graphitic foliation shear that forms the base of the Marble Shear Block. Failure of the Marble Shear Block could result in damage to the spillway and the tailrace area. The stability of the Block was reassessed for higher piezometric pressures and the design seismic event. The geological model was updated using additional geological and piezometric information from recent site investigations. An extensive instrumentation data review found that piezometric pressures close to the head of the slide had increased; however, this did not result in corresponding increases in slope movement. Instrumentation data showed that the 175 m high concrete dam moved downstream during reservoir filling and annually rocks back-and-forth due to thermal loading. The initial movement of the dam and this cyclic rocking motion was found to correlate with the movements observed in the Marble Shear Block. A finite element analysis showed that the movements of the concrete dam causes displacements along the centimetre-thick Marble Shear (which forms a continuous feature from underneath the concrete dam to the Marble Shear Block) and likely contributes to the downslope movement of the Marble Shear Block. Updated stability analyses also showed that the Marble Shear Block is currently stable and is more sensitive to piezometric pressures at the toe of the slope than the head of the slope.

B., Indian Institute of Technology Madras| Boominathan, A., Indian Institute of Technology Madras","|ABSTRACT: The effect of joints on wave propagation in rocks has always been a matter of concern with regard to their transmission and attenuation characteristics. Experimental studies are conducted to analyze the wave attenuation characteristics in single and parallel fractures at varying angles considering non welded interfaces in rocks. After validation with the ultrasonic pulse velocity tests, numerical models using UDEC were developed to simulate the wave propagation in jointed rocks. The numerical study was extended for multiple fractures over a range of ultra sonic frequencies. The effect of the fracture angle and number of cracks on the transmitted P wave velocity and corresponding travel time ratio were investigated. This study was conducted on blocks of artificially prepared rock specimens casted with gypsum plaster, introducing artificial joints at various angles. The variation in P wave velocity and travel time ratio for different joint angles and multiple joints have been studied.
1. INTRODUCTION
The propagation of waves through jointed medium is always under focus due to its various applications and implications<U+2025> Wave propagation through rock joints have been studied as the effect caused by the waves on the rock fractures as well as the effect of fractures on the attenuation pattern of the waves. The effect of wave depends on frequency and energy of the transmitted wave and the material properties of the rock. The knowledge on the attenuation pattern of waves across a fracture is very important for the safety of any rock engineering structure.
The fundamental interest in the study of seismic wave through jointed rocks will depend on the transmission and reflection of stress waves across joints. This will determine the stress occurring on rock structures due to earthquakes, vibration or explosions. The studies regarding the attenuation of elastic waves across rocks that started very long ago, is still a subject of concern. Miller (1977) pointed that a large part of the energy will be dissipated as frictional energy and that the frictional boundary stresses are non linear. Miller (1977,1978) proposed that wave propagations are dependent on the ratio of amplitude of incident stress to frictional stress associated with the non-linear model. In the absence of kinematic interlocking, transmission is nearly complete for very low values of this stress ratio and reflection is nearly complete for high values. The relation of frequency on the seismic wave reflection, transmission and conversion across natural joint fractures were again emphasized by Cook (1992), where a set of experiments lead him to correlate the theoretical analysis with his experimental results, by which specific stiffness and viscosities can be estimated from seismic reflections or from the change in amplitude and travel time of seismic waves transmitted across them. Cai and Zhao (2000) found that the magnitude of transmission coefficient depends on fracture spacing and number of fractures along with fracture stiffness and wave frequency<U+2025> The theoretical solution was based on displacement discontinuity model. The presence of multiple parallel fractures were studied in terms of spacing and number of fractures on the transmission coefficients which was confirmed using UDEC. It was found that transmission coefficients were independent of spacing length but were highly dependent on the number of fractures. The work was further extended by Zhao et. al. (2006a,b) and a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to analyze the theoretical solution by Cai and Zhao (2000). Zhao et. al. (2008) had considered the effect of non linear deformable joints on P wave propagation across fractures using UDEC. Li and Pyrak-Nolte (2010) analysed the effect of wave transmission on layered carbonate rocks. 1 MHz signals were passed to find the effect of joint stiffness, number of layers and angle of incidence. They also considered the results of these for a single fracture with theoretical methods like displacement discontinuity method and transfer matrix method. Eitzenberger (2012) described the effect of discontinuity on wave propagation to depend on roughness of surface, infill material, opening of discontinuity, thickness of infill, compressive strength of contact surface, normal and shear stiffness and water pressure and flow through the discontinuity using laboratory experiments and UDEC analysis. Many theoretical correlations on transmission and attenuation coefficient has been studied extensively for its variation based on fracture specific stiffness and stress ratio as the major parameter. The transmission coefficient was found to increase as the fracture stiffness coefficient increased and was found to decrease as the fracture stiffness coefficient decreased. As for inclined angles Schoenberg et. al. (1980), Pyrak-Nolte et. al. (1990b) gave theoretical relations on the transmission coefficient and reflection coefficient while Zou et. al. 2016 extended the theoretical solution by Pyrak-Nolte et.al.(1990b) to produce the difference in arrival time of P wave and S wave after transmission.|","Document Type

It is hence strongly required to investigate the deterioration mechanisms and the rational restoration methods of these structures based on the geotechnical engineering. For example, a platform that consists of a man-made soil mound and masonry stones was constructed as the foundation of the monuments in the Angkor ruins, which is a world cultural heritage in Cambodia. In order to achieve the restoration securing structural stability, the bearing capacity characteristics of the masonry platform structure should be understood. In the present study, numerical experiment on the bearing capacity of the masonry platform structures with different stone thickness is carried out using the elasto-plastic NMM-DDA (coupled Numerical Manifold Method and Discontinuous Deformation Analysis), one of the discontinuum-based numerical methods. Since masonry structures and foundation ground are modelled using DDA blocks and NMM elements, respectively in the NMM-DDA, the interactive problems between soils (continua) and masonry stones (discontinua) can be suitably treated. From the simulation results, the differences of the ultimate bearing capacity and the failure mechanisms due to the structural conditions are compared and its mechanisms are also discussed.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Angkor ruins, a World Cultural Heritage in Cambodia, includes many masonry structures in danger of collapse due to geotechnical problems, such as uneven settlement of the foundation ground (see Fig. 1). In order to select suitable restoration methods, stability evaluation considering the mechanical interaction between the masonry building (discontinuum) and the foundation ground (continuum) is required (JSA, 2005, NNRICP, 2015). Especially, the bearing capacity characteristics of the foundation which consists of artificial soil embankment and masonry stones (Fig. 2), so-called ‘platform’ should be reflected in the design.
In case of the foundation shown in Fig. 2, the weight of the upper structure is applied on the top stone and transmitted to both the masonry stones and man-made embankment of lower layers. Since the mechanical behaviors of such composite structures are governed by the material nonlinearity of soil and the discontinuity of the masonry stones, it is difficult to solve the failure mechanism of the platform by theoretical method.|","Document Type

Firstly, we discuss reservoir pressure re-charge and in-situ stress response, from simple pressure-depth plots to more complex 3-D numerical modelling of the stress changes in reservoirs and surrounding formations. An added level of complexity compared to ‘conventional’ geomechanical modelling is the ability to forward predict the reservoir pressure recharge over hundreds of years and the commensurate response of the in-situ stresses. Secondly, as well as the modelling of stress changes over time, Geomechanics has a key role to play in determining the opportunity of using shale creep deformation to create annular barriers in the place of cement. Lastly, in some cases the preferred P&A design for a well is not possible due to well access issues which then requires cross-flow analysis linked with the geomechanical response of permeable formations. This approach is required for containment risk assessment and application of ‘as low as reasonably practicable’ (ALARP) assessments for well and formation integrity. Each of these subjects will be covered with field examples from the UK North Sea which demonstrate the Geomechanical workflows employed and the impact these have had on the business.|","Document Type

Laboratory creep data is always limited in time and therefore a creep compliance function is needed to extrapolate laboratory findings and to model long-term behavior. |In this paper, we present a comparison of regression methods, using creep data of shale samples from the Baltic Basin, Poland. Creep data used for the analysis consists of three 72-hours-long tests and one two-week-long test. Differential load was applied in steps, the last one lasted for 39 hours in case of shorter tests, and 303 hours for the longer test. In order to describe the uncertainty of every method, we fitted parts of the data of different lengths, and then extrapolated the fitted function to the entire time span of the data. |While self-similar functions such as the power-law and logarithmic function are useful for the relatively few parameters required to describe creep behavior, Prony series give better fit to laboratory data by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in least-squares sense. However, the caveat of the Prony series is that the choice of retardation times is not necessarily unique. Although Prony series with different sets of retardation times may fit a data equally well, these may predict completely different results when extrapolated to larger times beyond the laboratory experiment. In this paper we investigated wide spectrum of retardation times, and the parameters obtained from inversion. |1. INTRODUCTION |Shales may have diverse lithological composition, compaction level, but their common feature is high clay content and very low permeability with relatively high porosity. Time-dependent deformations, even at constant and small load, are caused by a delayed microstructural deterioration, known as cataclastic creep (Fabre and Pellet 2006). Also, clay platelets and grains may undergo sliding and rotation followed by aggregate deformation. These phenomena are slowed down by friction and thus appear viscous. Creep is an inelastic phenomena, and often is neglected in reservoir analysis. The inverse of creep strain is stress relaxation. In bigger scale, when ductile shales are loaded tectonically, they exhibit instantaneous elastic response, followed by long-term stress relaxation. It can change significantly the in situ stress state in the reservoir.|","Document Type

A core characterization workflow is used to specifically probe geomechanical heterogeneity and anisotropy for static and dynamic elastic properties as well as failure strength. Initial petrophysical scanning of the core surface provides a first indication of existing heterogeneity for properties of interest and assists in devising an efficient sampling strategy. Over the three-foot section analyzed, and despite its apparent homogeneity, the core exhibits a two-fold variation in reduced Young’s modulus between softer and stiffer zones, which is tied to slight changes in carbonate content. Confined elastic and mechanical measurements reveal strength anisotropy of the order of 20% and P-wave and S-wave velocity anisotropies of about 20% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, testing shows that the shale is weakest at oblique angle to the bedding due to weak bed parallel surfaces which activate when favorably oriented. These results suggest that anisotropy and heterogeneity both need to be accounted for in borehole stability models involving smectite-rich material.
1. INTRODUCTION
Accurate wellbore stability prediction in geomechanically unstable formations requires thorough understanding of the drilled rock properties. This includes the ability to predict failure in deviated wells associated with bedding heterogeneity or to better assess the relationship between intrinsic elastic properties and stress/strain boundary conditions for e.g. in situ stress computations and log-based geomechanical forecasting.
This paper presents a geomechanical core analysis workflow that includes petrophysical core scanning for heterogeneity assessment and sample picking, as well as geomechanical testing for anisotropic static/dynamic elastic properties and strength. In particular, the petrophysical scanning includes a mechanical probe called the Impulse Hammer which functions by analyzing the force-time function of a hardened steel sphere mounted on an accelerometer dropped on the surface of the rock. This analysis produces a reduced Young’s modulus at a resolution on the order of the millimeter revealing fine scale heterogeneity. Using the profiles obtained during petrophysical scanning, locations of interest can be chosen for further geomechanical evaluation on plugs.|","Document Type

W., Sichuan University","|ABSTRACT: Understanding the dynamic mechanical properties of jointed rocks is beneficial for the rational design and stability analysis of rock engineering projects. This study experimentally investigated the influences of joint geometrical parameters on the dynamic fatigue mechanism of jointed rock models using the synthetic materials with artificially intermittent joints. Our results revealed that the dynamic fatigue stress-strain curve of jointed rock is dominated by its static uniaxial curve; the terminal failure strain in dynamic fatigue curve is equal to the post-peak strain corresponding to the maximum cyclic stress in the static stress-strain curve. The studied four joint geometrical parameters significantly affect the dynamic properties, including the energy evolution, the damage variable and the crack coalescence pattern. The higher the geometrical parameter, the higher the fatigue damage accumulates in the first few cycles, and the lower the fatigue life. Two basic micro-cracks, i.e., tensile wing crack and shear crack, are observed in dynamic cyclic tests, which are controlled principally by joint dip angle and persistency. In general, shear cracks only occur in jointed rocks with high dip angle or high persistency, and these jointed rocks are associated with the low fatigue strength, the large damage variable and the low fatigue life.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock engineering structures, such as underground tunnels, dam foundations and bridge abutments, are likely to be subjected to dynamic cyclic loadings resulting from earthquakes, rock blasting, rock bursts, etc. Widely existing in these rock structures, intermittent jointed rocks are most sensitive to cyclic loading conditions and the joints play a controlling role in the overall stability of rock engineering. A comprehensive understanding of the dynamic mechanical response of intermittent jointed rocks subjected to cyclic loadings is beneficial for the stability analysis and rational design of rock structures.
Most studies in the literature have been focused on the dynamic properties of intact rocks under cyclic loadings. A hysteresis of the stress-strain curve and an accumulative dynamic deformation were revealed via laboratory tests (Burdine, 1963; Attewell and Farmer, 1973; Ray et al., 1999). Researchers also investigated the fatigue strength and deformation of intact rocks. They reported that both the dynamic strength and elastic modulus decrease exponentially with increasing cycles (Bagde and Petros, 2005a, b; Fuenkajorn and Phueakphum, 2010). In addition, the dynamic energy characteristic of intact rocks under cyclic loadings has been investigated (Hua and You, 2001; Bagde and Petros, 2009; Momeni et al., 2015), and Meng et al. (2016) further indicated that the fatigue failure of the intact rocks occurs once the elastic energy reaches its storage limitation. To determine an ideal damage variable for describing the actual evolution of fatigue damage, Xiao et al. (2009, 2010) assessed six definition methods of damage variable and proposed an inverted-S shape nonlinear model for fatigue damage of intact rocks. Similarly, an obvious three-stage evolution for the accumulative fatigue damage of intact granite was observed by Momeni et al. (2015).|","Document Type

The project was sponsored by the “Engineers Make a World of Difference” design contest. The biomineralized Bridger Mountain Range model currently resides in the entrance foyer area of the COE Dean’s office at Montana State University. The Bridger Mountains are named after a famous pioneer of the 1800’s, Jim Bridger, who explored and discovered the world around him. The students anticipate that just as Jim Bridger was a pioneer of the past, this project shows that engineers are the pioneers of the present. Their successful vision and execution of the project is now proudly displayed to promote the spirit of discovery and imagination at Montana State University.
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Biomineralization
Certain microbes have the capability to alter the chemistry of fluids. This results in supersaturation and precipitation of minerals such as calcium carbonate. One example is the microorganism, Sporosarcina pasteurii, which produces an enzyme (urease) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to produce ammonium and carbonate. The produced carbonate can react with calcium resulting in the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This process is known in the literature as microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) (De Muynck et al., 2010; DeJong et al., 2010; Mitchell et al., 2010; Phillips et al., 2013a; Stocks-Fischer et al., 1999).
MICP has been studied for engineering applications in the subsurface to modify permeability and reduce the leakage of geologically sequestered fluids (carbon dioxide, methane, nuclear waste, produced fluids) (Cunningham et al., 2014; Cuthbert et al., 2013; Dupraz et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2016; Phillips et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2013b). MICP technology uses aqueous solutions to promote precipitation to seal unwanted flow paths especially in small aperture fractures.|","Document Type

In this paper, a novel method is described for the visual detection and model reconstruction of underwater topography and rock mass surface by using B-mode ultrasonic imaging device. It automatically detects the imaging lines of topography and rock mass surface in the obtained ultrasonic images. These imaging lines are used to detect and reconstruct underwater topography and rock mass surface. Experimental results show rock mass and topography surface can be clearly detected, and the error of visual detection and model reconstruction for surface can be less than 1 mm during our model testing. This method can effectively neglect the imaging interference of moving or suspended particles on the detection of rock surface under muddy water or in sediment-laden flow. With the advantages of fast speed, high accuracy and real time of B-mode ultrasonic imaging device, this method is an effective approach of visual detection and model reconstruction for underwater topography and rock mass surface.
1. INTRODUCTION
The accurate detection and model reconstruction for underwater topography and rock mass surface is vital for the research of sedimentation and rock geotechnical engineering. Topographic meters, which use impedance and optoelectronic signaling principles [1], must contact underwater topographic surface. It may destroy the original local topography and result in a large measuring error. Laser topographic meter and traditional acoustic detection method have high measuring precision when applied to model topography [2]. But these methods are unsuitable for underwater topography and rock mass surface under muddy flow because the flow is clouded with moving particles near the riverbed [3].
However, ultrasound imaging method can improve these problems [4]. In order to obtain the real-time ultrasonic image of underwater topography and rock mass surface, a B-mode ultrasonic imaging device is used in the river model experiment [5]. Faced with these images obtained by B-mode ultrasonic imaging device, the imaging of sediment particles can be used to analyze suspended sediment concentration [6], particle velocity [7] and flow field [8]. The imaging of submerged terrain can be used to observe the change process of sediment movement [9-11] and help the understanding of riverbed evolution [12-13]. The knowledge of ultrasonic imaging features in sediment-laden flow or muddy water is fundamental for the application of B-mode ultrasonic imaging device in the hydraulic engineering model test.|","Document Type

A 2D boundary element code (MineHF2D) is used to simulate hydraulic fracture interaction using experimental parameters such as interface friction, injection system compressibility and fracture toughness. Crossing and arresting (blunting) hydraulic fracture behaviors have been observed in experimental and numerical results for orthogonal and inclined interfaces. Optical analysis of video records allows tracking of fracture pathways, growth rate and opening (fracture width). The experimental results are presented using the Renshaw-Pollard criterion and compared to numerical simulation outputs. The numerical predictions of crossing behavior, fracture pathways including offsets and crossing fracture re-initiation delay compared well with measurements.
1. INTRODUCTION
Interaction between a growing hydraulic fracture (hereafter also called HF) and discontinuities within the rock (such as a natural fracture, fault, or bedding plane, hereafter called NF or discontinuity) can have a significant impact on hydraulic fracture growth and the resulting treatment effectiveness (Kresse, Weng, Chuprakov, Prioul, & Cohen, 2013). This HF-NF interaction problem has been studied using modelling (Zhang & Jeffrey, 2006, 2008), laboratory experiments (Blanton, 1986; Bunger, Kear, Jeffrey, Prioul, & Chuprakov, 2016; Gu et al., 2012; R. G. Jeffrey et al., 2015; Kresse et al., 2013; Warpinski & Teufel, 1987) and field studies (Robert G. Jeffrey et al., 2009; Warpinski & Teufel, 1987; Weng, 2015; Weng et al., 2014) with the intent of developing a greater understanding of hydraulic fracture growth behavior in a naturally fractured rock mass.
The HF-NF interaction mechanics are complex, and two main effects are considered critical to this interaction. Firstly, local stresses at the discontinuity are changed by the stress and displacement influence of an approaching HF. Through this process, the tensile stress induced ahead of the fracture tip (process zone) can cause local sliding on the discontinuity. Alternatively, if the friction coefficient of the discontinuity is large enough to resist sliding, the applied forces can be transferred across the discontinuity and cause the creation and growth of a tensile fracture on the far side of the discontinuity.|","Document Type

Y., University of Houston| Rafiee, M., StatOil| Morse, S., Texas Tech University","|ABSTRACT: The Displacement Discontinuity Method (DDM) is one of the most popular numerical methods in simulating hydraulic fracturing problems. Despite its superior advantages in solving fracture modeling problems, this method becomes computationally expensive when the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) increases. An example takes place in the study of two-dimensional fracturing problems with multiple fractures propagating from one or more wells. It would also occur in three-dimensional problems where typically the number of elements exceeds a few thousands. Additionally, including poroelasticity into the problem makes this method even more computationally expensive because of the necessity to build a time-marching procedure. The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is a computational method to efficiently compute matrix-vector products with a controllable error. Unlike the conventional Boundary Element Method (BEM), in FMM the interaction between far-field sources and influenced points are calculated by initially concentrating a cluster of far-field sources into a separate point, then the effect of these concentrated forces on each influenced point is calculated. |In this study, a novel technique known as black-box fast multipole method (bbFMM) is used to improve the computational efficiency of a poroelastic displacement discontinuity hydraulic fracture model while keeping its accuracy. This method is used to develop an efficient poroelastic hydraulic fracture simulator. Then, the simulator is used to examine the computational effectiveness and the accuracy of the new approach against the conventional displacement discontinuity approach in calculating stresses, displacements and pore pressure. A comparison between efficiency and precision of the developed fast multipole model and the conventional displacement discontinuity model is presented. Several cases of discrete fracture problems with large degrees of freedom are tested. Results show that the new approach reduces the computation time and memory compared to the conventional approach. The applicability of the developed model in hydraulic fracturing problems is also demonstrated. Because of this increase in computational performance, this method can be applied to poroelasticity problems which require such computations at each time step. Unlike the regular method, calculations using the FMM algorithm may be accomplished in a reasonable time.|",""

The major factors that affect the fracture containment during fluid injection include in-situ stress condition and geomechanical properties of the rocks. In order to address this issue, our experimental study utilized two rocks: sandstone and mudstone. We performed a series of laboratory triaxial experiments to determine the geomechanical properties and fracture mechanical properties of intact rocks. Experiments were also conducted on rock specimens prepared with precut failure shear planes bonded with epoxy. Comparison was conducted between the intact and bonded rocks. The friction angle and cohesion of the intact mudstone evaluated using Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion are 47.8° and 10 MPa, respectively. Using the Hoek-Brown failure criterion, for normal stresses from 0 to 400 MPa, the cohesion of the intact sandstone ranged from 8.5 to 113.8 MPa and the friction angle ranged from 69.2° to 28.7°. Bonded rocks have lower Young’s moduli and maximum shear strength. The geomechanical properties of bonded samples were governed by the confining pressure-dependent strength of the epoxy.
1. INTRODUCTION
Major factors that affect the fracture containment during fluid injection include in-situ stress, material property contrast, and bedding interfaces. In-situ stress has been considered one of the most significant effects on fracture-height growth. It is recognized that higher minimum in-situ horizontal stress in the overlying lay is favorable for fracture containment within the injection formation (Fisher and Warpinski, 2012). It was shown that low-modulus bounding formations surrounding a higher-modulus injection formation can be favorable for facture to be contained within the injection formation, but containment also depends on the relative fracture toughness of the rocks in different formations. When a fracture approaches a layer interface, it could be arrested or it could be step over the interface. It is well known that bedding interfaces hinder facture vertical growth because crossing interfaces requires additional energy. However, the complicated interaction mechanism between the interface and the fracturing process makes the understanding of the fracture containment extremely challenging (Fisher and Warpinski, 2012). In spite of the importance of the interaction between hydraulic fractures and bedding interfaces for fracture containment analysis in hydraulic fracture enhances hydrocarbon recovery, a sound theory is not reliable.|","Document Type

The assessment of rock fall risk along roads, in communities below mountains and in mining operations is imperative. Numerical models are often used to predict rock fall trajectories, assess the effectiveness of benched slope designs, and aid in the design of rock fall barriers. Inputs into the models should be calibrated with field tests or historic case studies specific to the geological setting. This paper investigates the primary impact distance (PID) and the total rollout distance (RD) from the base of the slope using both field tests and numerical models. Understanding and having the ability to predict PID and RD for future rock fall events is beneficial during the slope design process for optimizing slope angles to minimize excavation costs and risk management for constructed or natural slopes.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock fall is the movement of rock from a slope that is so steep that the rock continues to move down the slope. The movement can be free falling, bouncing, rolling or sliding as illustrated in Figure 1.
Rock falls can be a result of slope degradation from weathering, freeze-thaw action, earthquakes, blast vibrations, excavation, pore pressure changes due to rainfall infiltration, surface water runoff, root-growth or leverage by roots moving in high winds (Hoek, 2007).
When areas prone to rock falls are unknown or not adequately managed, rock falls can present a major hazard to human activities and infrastructure below. When designing barriers to manage rock fall risk, an engineer needs to consider the following aspects of a possible rock fall event:
Geometry of the slope and location of infrastructure and human activity.|Size of the expected rock and associated kinetic energy.|Expected primary impact distance (PID) from the base of the slope.|Expected total rollout distance (RD).","Document Type

Although there have been relatively successful modifications to Darcy’s law to account for inertial effects, for example, the Forchheimer equation (Du Plessis, 1994; Skjetne and Auriault, 1999; Handren et al., 2001), none of these relationships are valid when the flow is highly compressible (De Ville, 1996; Ciarletta and Straughan, 2006; Straughan, 2008; Jin et al., 2011a, 2012a,b; Jiang et al., 2015a,b,c, 2016). Recently, Jin et al. (2011b) studied the development of the tensile stress in the high pressure gas well considering the high compressive gas flow. The gas acceleration effect plays an important role in the high compressive gas flow, and can induce the large effective tensile stress.

1. INTRODUCTION
As one of the major accomplishments of recent years, 3D Printing, also known as additive manufacturing (Wohlers, T. and T. Gornet, 2014), is invented and extensively applied in multiple subjects, including biological medicine, electronic components and modern handicraft (Murphy, S.V. and A. Atala. 2014; Lee, V.K. et al., 2014). For the purpose of Engineering, versatile 3D printed models, whose materials mainly include the sand-powder and Polylactic Acid (PLA), were created to be tested for various types of analysis.
These artificially created models have the following advantages: precise, flexible, controllable, repeatable, time saving, effort saving, and economical. Thus, recent rock mechanics and petroleum engineering research is targeting to use 3D printing in physical modelling experiments. Recent publications of modeling rock specimens through 3D printing has revealed its advantages in producing complicated samples with special external forms and internal structures (Jiang, Q. et al., 2016). With the use of X-ray tomography, 3D pore structures inside a reservoir rock is extracted and imaged. Then, these images become the reference substance and prototype to be used for printing 3D artificial porosity models, which are further laboratory rock tested (Ishutov, S. et al., 2015). Hydraulic fracturing is the main technology to produce from shale reservoirs in the recent years, where the fundamental research related to this topic also introduced utilizing 3D printing into the laboratory. With the aim of investigation of fracture effect on rock properties, 3D printing technology is used to generate specimens that have cracks with variable density, inclination angles and combination forms (Jiang, C. et al., 2016). While, most of the printing inks, or materials, belong to the category of plastic materials such as Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene(ABS) or Polylactic Acid (PLA). The printing material of gypsum powder bonded with Visijet clear agent, which is called “Full Color Sandstone”, is commercially spread and not fully investigated for rock related studies.|","Document Type

Depth of spalling failure around underground openings is stress-driven and proportional to the size of the tunnel. Various modelling approaches based on continuum, discontinuum and hybrid methods have been proposed in recent years to predict the depth of spalling around underground openings. This paper initially reviews results of numerical approaches based on continuum and discontinuum methods in reproducing the spalling damage around the URL Mine-by tunnel. The importance of micro-heterogeneity on the mechanism leading to the spalling failure in massive Lac du Bonnet granite around the Mine-by tunnel is studied using an integrated hybrid finite/discrete element-discrete fracture network (FDEM-DFN) approach. The FDEM-DFN numerical results showed that the presence of micro-heterogeneity plays an important role in the in-situ strength reduction of the massive Lac du Bonnet granite, leading to spalling failure at a stress level around 50-60% of the laboratory uniaxial compressive strength (UCS). The shape and depth of spalling failure obtained from the FDEM-DFN approach agrees well with in-situ observations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Failure of underground openings in hard brittle rocks is a function of the in-situ stress magnitudes and the characteristics of the rock mass i.e., the intact rock strength and the fracture network. Failure at low in-situ stress magnitudes is controlled by continuity and distribution of the natural fractures in the rock mass matrix [1]. As the magnitudes of the in-situ stress increase, the failure process is dominated by new stress-induced fractures growing parallel to the excavation boundary. Rock bursting and spalling are two common failure modes in underground civil and mining excavations under high in-situ stress regimes. Spalling damage is described as the development of visible extension fractures (Mode I) under compressive loading that can be either violent or non-violent [2]. High induced tangential stress acting at the periphery of underground openings, where the confining pressure is very low, results in spalling and rock bursting failure. This type of brittle damage leads to the formation of the closely-spaced slabs around a tunnel wall oriented parallel to the major principal stress (tangential) direction.|","Document Type

A large-scale true triaxial physical simulation device of hydraulic fracturing was adopted to carry out hydraulic fracturing for natural cores with/without of confining pressures. Meanwhile, acoustic emission (AE) signals during the acquisition test were monitored. On this basis, distributions of AE events and the real morphologies of hydraulic fractures were compared to qualitatively analyze the relation between spatial distribution of AE events and hydraulic fractures. In the entire process of hydraulic fracturing, with/without confining pressures, the distribution region of micro-fractures had a tendency to concentrate on the fracture plane with the increase in pumping pressures. In addition, with confining pressures, the range of the inelastic region was always larger than that without confining pressures. Analysis on nonlinear region varying with time indicated that the inelastic region inside the rock dynamically developed during hydraulic fracturing and it also had a preferable consistency with fracture morphologies.
1. INTRODUCTION
Since 1949 when the hydraulic fracturing technology was applied in North America for the first time (Clark, 1949), it played a critical role in unconventional reservoir stimulation (King, 2010). In recent years, this technology is also adopted to develop geothermal resources based on the Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) (MIT, 2006).
Soon after the application of hydraulic fracturing, a mathematical model related to it is proposed (Zheltov and Khristianovich, 1955). During studies on rock fracturing, Labuz et al. (1985) present a modified Barenblatt (1962) model targeted at it by means of a series of tests. Based on previous suppositions, the nonlinear region existing on crack tip during hydraulic fracturing attracts more and more attentions (Desroches et al., 1993; Papanastasiou and Thiercelin, 1993; Gardner, 1992). In line with large quantities of laboratory hydraulic fracture tests by Johns and Cleary (1991), non-linear region generate on the crack tip had an influence on pressure distributions in the fracture, which is differentiated from the original elastic model. Similarly, the study on magma-driven dike propagation also proves that confining pressure is able to exert significant impacts on the nonlinear region during fracture propagation (Rubin, 1993).|","Document Type

M., Advantek Waste Management Services","|ABSTRACT: Static Poisson’s ratio plays a vital role in calculating the minimum and maximum horizontal stresses which are required to alleviate the risks associated with the drilling and production operations. Incorrect estimation of Static Poisson’s ratio may wrongly lead to inappropriate field development plans which consequently result in heavy investment decisions. Static Poisson’s ratio can be determined by retrieving cores throughout the depth of the reservoir section and performing laboratory tests, which are extremely expensive as well as time consuming. The objective of this paper is to develop a robust and an accurate model for estimating static Poisson’s ratio based on 610 core sample measurements and their corresponding wireline logs data using artificial neural network. The obtained results showed that the developed ANN model was able to predict the static Poisson’s ratio based on log data; bulk density, compressional time, and shear time. The developed ANN model can be used to estimate static Poisson’s ratio with high accuracy; the correlation coefficient was 0.98 and the average absolute error was 1.3%. In the absence of core data, the developed technique will help engineers to estimate a continuous profile of the static Poisson’s ratio and hence reduce the overall cost of the well.
1. INTRODUCTION
Linear elastic behavior of a rock is represented by two parameters, i.e., Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. These are the key parameters for constructing 1D and 3D geo-mechanical earth model (Chang et al., 2006). Poisson’s ratio is the ratio of lateral expansion to longitudinal contraction (Jaegar et al., 2007). It is the material property that plays a vital role in assessing the deformation of elastic materials and can be defined as the behavior in which a substance tends to elongate in the direction perpendicular to the direction of compression. The common example of Poisson’s ratio is rubber band, which on stretched becomes markedly thinner.|","Document Type

The model is verified by theoretical analysis, laboratory experiments and numerical simulation using DDA. It is successful to reproduce the unprecedented vertical surface acceleration of nearly four times gravity, recorded at the West Ichinoseki station during the 14 June 2008 Iwate-Miyagi earthquake (Ms6.9) in Japan, by DDA simulation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Extreme motions are often observed during strong earthquakes. They can be classified as the extreme large acceleration, the extreme large velocity and the extreme large displacement.
For example, an unprecedented vertical surface acceleration of nearly four times gravity was recorded at the West Ichinoseki station, 3 km southwest of the epicenter, during the 14 June 2008 Iwate-Miyagi earthquake (Ms6.9) in Japan.
As an example of extreme large velocity motion, a huge rock was found ejected from a slope and flied across an unbelievable long horizontal distance comparing with the corresponding slope height after the 12 May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Ms8.0) in China. The initial ejecting velocity is estimated as large as 17m/s.
For examples of extreme large displacement motions, many large scale landslides induced by strong earthquakes were found with extreme long run-out distances which are more than 10 times the average runout distance of ordinary landslides.
Why and how these extreme motions occurred are still incomprehensible problems. It is important and necessary to clarify the mechanisms of these extreme motions induced by earthquakes for disaster mitigation in earthquake engineering as well as seismology.
We have studied on the mechanism of each extreme motion phenomenon. A sudden braking model is proposed for the mechanism of the extreme large acceleration. A ping pong model is proposed for the mechanism of extreme large velocity. A Multiplex Acceleration Model is proposed for extreme large displacement. The above mentioned extreme motions can be explained by using these models and they have been successfully simulated by using DDA simulations. In this paper, we only focus on discussing and clarifying the mechanism of the extreme acceleration due to the paper length limitation. The mechanism of the other two phenomena will be analyzed in a separated paper.|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Rockfall is one of the most frequent geo-hazards, which often occurs in mountain areas and along land transportation. It often causes serious consequences in terms of lives lost, homes destroyed and infrastructures disrupted because its high energy and significant mobility, although it usually impacts only small areas compared to other geo-hazards (Guzzetti et al., 2002). In addition, rockfall event occurs accidently in most cases, that is hardly unpredictable and usually without any obvious warnings (Masuya et al., 2009). As for examples, there are many reports on rockfall induced fatalities and economic losses particularly along roads from China, Japan and other parts of the world (Hungr et al., 2004). Therefore, in order to mitigate rockfall risk, it is important to clear the disaster-caused mechanism and take preventive measures correspondingly.
Different rockfall analysis methods have been proposed at different scales through empirical models, process-based models and Geophysical Information System (GIS)-based models. However, most of these approaches assess the rockfall using heuristic approaches, expert judgement or analysis of relatively small historical datasets. This makes them inapplicable in seismic areas, where the rockfall is mostly caused by earthquake events (Valagussa et al., 2014).|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
In order to address the challenges of subsurface energy-related processes involving fractures, fracturing, and permeability enhancement, earth scientists from several national laboratories and three universities have carried out a project to develop a new underground facility called kISMET (permeability (k) and Induced Seismicity Management for Energy Technologies) located on the 4850 level (4850L) nominally 4850 ft (1478 m) below ground (actually 4757 ft (1450 m) below ground) at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota. The purpose of the new facility is to provide a test site for research on stress characterization, permeability enhancement, and induced seismicity in crystalline rock. Rocks at SURF comprise a sequence of intensely folded Precambrian metamorphic schists, phyllites, and amphibolites cut by a number of Tertiary rhyolite dikes. The kISMET experiments meet objectives in the U.S. Department of Energy SubTER initiative under the “stress” pillar and in the “new subsurface signals” pillar through the monitoring of fracturing by active seismic, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), and passive microseismic approaches accompanied by numerical modeling. The rocks at SURF are representative of deep crystalline rocks with low natural permeability targeted in some regions of the U.S. and around the world for enhanced geothermal system (EGS) development.|","Document Type

A Finite Element sand production prediction workflow was used as the basis of the model setup, which includes a three-layered model considering the rock, well, casings and perforations. Additional detail for the casing and partial cement coverage was implemented in these models to capture the changed loads, stress and boundary conditions affecting both the wellbore and perforations. Modelling considered a number of different conditions: 1) Amount of cement coverages; 2) Depletion stages; and 3) Rock strengths. The prediction results were compared with the standard sand production prediction results assuming a perfect cement bonding. It was found that for partial cement coverage, increase of plastic strain on wellbore depends on the location of the cement void: if the void is in a low stress concentration location, the risk of sanding on wellbore wall only increases slightly comparing to fully cemented cases; if the void is in a high stress concentration area then the risk of sanding will be as high as in the no cement case. Compared to the great increase in the sanding at the wellbore wall, the increase in sanding risk on the perforations is minor and mainly for perforations in high stress concentration areas. The results of the study can be used to support a selective perforation strategy based on cement bond logs to identify the casing-cement bonding conditions and the target area parameters such as rock strength and orientations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Predicting the onset of sand production in oil and gas fields is an important aspect of sand management and has been the focus of numerous researchers over the past decades. Laboratory measurements, field calibrations, and different prediction methods including both analytical and numerical (Okland et al. 1996, van den Hoek et al. 2000, Veeken et al. 1991, Volonte et al. 2013, Willson et al. 2001) have been developed to define the conditions at which the reservoir rock will fail and start to produce sand. However, simplified and idealized assumptions were usually used in the chosen methods to get a faster solution for a larger number of cases. Although it might be fast and effective, it could also increase uncertainty for some predictions and may lead to wrong decision-making in some extreme cases. Among all the complications caused by either operations or hostile field conditions, completion integrity, such as the cement bond condition for cased and perforated completion, has been commonly neglected during sand production prediction. Borehole condition and cement sheath are sometimes considered as part of the sand management by using rule of thumb methods (Addis et al 2008), however, the effect of cement bond quality towards the risk of sand production has not been investigated properly in previously published references.|","Document Type

During production, the strong depletion of the Fulmar reservoir caused a number of geomechanical-related problems, including the failure of the initial development wells, and consequently, loss of production. In order to reinstate production at Shearwater, five infill wells have been drilled and completed successfully. This success was largely attributed to a multidisciplinary effort to understand the post-production changes of the overburden. In this paper, a comprehensive 3D geomechanical model is presented that was used as a key design foundation for safe HP/HT well delivery. The model results and interpretations are discussed, and a summary of the current understanding of the evolution of the overburden from a geomechanical perspective is provided. The challenges associated with infill drilling and, in particular, the loss of fracture gradient and the closure of the drilling mud weight window between this and pore pressure, and how these have added complexity to the drilling practices are described. Finally, key technologies implemented to overcome these issues including Managed Pressure Drilling, Drill-In Liner and Wellbore Strengthening are discussed.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Shearwater field located in the UK Central Graben represents one of the most challenging high-pressure, high-temperature (HP/HT) developments of its kind in the North Sea. At the time of the initial development, elevated pressures in excess of 15,000 psi and temperatures greater than 350°F, and structural geology complexity, posed major technical challenges to Shearwater. These challenges involved all aspects of well construction and production in HP/HT conditions. Despite the challenges, all initial development wells were drilled successfully.
During the first years of production, and similar to other HP fields, reservoir pressures dropped rapidly to 8,000 psi on average. The strong depletion of the reservoir, in combination with the high compressibility of the reservoir rock, resulted in compaction of the Fulmar sandstones and led to displacements, deformations and stress changes in the overburden rock. Compaction-induced stress changes in the overburden (“stress arching”) were the driving force for a number of geomechanical-related subsurface problems. During 2004-2007, it resulted in four production liners being sheared due to slippage along faults or bedding planes near the crest of the structure. Furthermore, over time, some initial development wells then experienced rapid A-annulus pressure increases, suggesting a leak of the production casing at Hod Chalk Formation level.|","Document Type

S., University of Utah","|ABSTRACT: Measuring the elastic modulus of in-situ rock masses over scales of tens of meters remains an important challenge in experimental rock mechanics. We present a new approach using ambient resonance measurements of freestanding rock masses to identify vibrational modes, which are then matched with numerical models implementing bulk, globally representative material properties. The result is an experimentally determined, albeit numerically calibrated, estimate of rock mass elastic modulus. We demonstrate the approach at four natural rock arches in southern Utah where we have acquired resonance data and been able to match experimental resonant modes using 3D numerical analysis. Two material properties can be varied to match experimental data, density and modulus; we hold the former constant applying measured or common values and solve for modulus using a forward approach. The resolved modulus is representative of the global small-strain dynamic behavior, integrating rock mass heterogeneity over the scale of the feature. The technique works well for freestanding geological features that exhibit clear vibrational modes. Errors arise with uncertain mechanical boundary conditions. We propose the resolved global value of modulus adds relevant information describing the variation of elastic properties over scales from lab samples to in-situ rock masses.
1. INTRODUCTION
Measurements of rock mass elastic modulus are scale-dependent (Heuze, 1980), complicating efforts to translate laboratory results from core sample testing to scales relevant for most rock engineering problems (Cai et al., 2004). Micro- and macroscopic discontinuities separating intact rock fragments are variably compliant features (Li, 2001; Zangerl et al., 2008), making the rock mass deformation (Em) and elastic (Ee) moduli (sensu ISRM, 1975) well below the Young’s modulus obtained from corresponding intact rock specimens (Ei) (Farmer and Kemeny, 1992; Wyllie, 2003). Accurate prediction of rock mass deformation is crucial in a wide variety of rock engineering applications (e.g. tunnel support, foundations), highlighting the relevance of modulus measurements at engineering-relevant scales.
Different approaches have been proposed to measure or estimate the deformation and elastic moduli of in-situ rock masses (ISRM, 1979; Palmstrom and Singh, 2001; Cai et al., 2004; Hoek and Diederichs, 2006). In-situ tests, such as plate jacking, measure stresses and strain over relevant scales (usually by diametrically loading a small tunnel or test adit), but they are time consuming and expensive to perform, and the results are affected by excavation damage. A more common approach is to estimate rock mass modulus from empirical relations, often non-linear, developed by comparing in-situ test measurements with rock mass classification schemes, e.g. RMR, GSI, and Q (Hoek and Diederichs, 2006). For massive rock (i.e. rock masses containing few joints), Palmstrom and Singh (2001) proposed the simplified relationship Em = 0.5 • Ei. In all cases, a high degree of variability is anticipated between the estimated and performance-based rock mass modulus.|","Document Type

R., Geological Institute| Amann, F., Geological Institute| Evans, K. F., Geophysical Institute ETH| Doetsch, J., Geophysical Institute ETH| Valley, B., University of Neuchatel","|ABSTRACT: In preparation of a decameter-scale fault stimulation experiment at the Grimsel Test Site, Switzerland, a comprehensive rock stress characterization survey was conducted. The survey combines overcoring of CSIRO-HI and USBM probes with hydrofracture measurements with concomitant monitoring of the induced microseismicity. Impression packer surveys were run following the hydrofracture tests to determine the orientation of the induced fracture at the wellbore. The orientation of the fracture away from the wellbore was determined from the pattern of the microseismicity. The use of a transverse isotropic model for inverting the strains measured during overcoring was essential to obtain stress solutions that were consistent with the hydrofracture and microseismicity results. The indicate that the minimum principal stress, <U+03C3>3, is sub-horizontal and oriented north-south. The maximum principal stress, <U+03C3>1, dips at 30-40° to the east and has a magnitude of 13-17 MPa. The magnitude of <U+03C3>2, is similar to <U+03C3>3, and lies in the range 8-10 MPa.
1. INTRODUCTION
To accelerate the development of Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) technology, the In-situ Stimulation and Circulation (ISC) experiment is being conducted at the Grimsel Test Site (GTS), Switzerland to investigate fundamental processes activated by injections into preexisting faults and shear zones. This decameter scale experiment aims to address open questions concerning induced seismicity, permeability enhancement, and hydro-mechanical fault response during deep EGS reservoir stimulation operations. Further information can be found in Amann et al. (2017).
Knowledge of the in-situ stress situation within the rock mass is crucial to the design of the experiment and the eventual interpretation of the data, since stress dictates whether slip will occur on pre-existing discontinuities in response to the elevated pressure of the injections, and also controls the magnitude and direction. Thus, a stress measurement campaign that combined stress relief and hydraulic methods was conducted in three differently oriented boreholes (Figure 1). Borehole SBH-1 was drilled with a slight inclination to vertical of 15° towards N260°E, the best-estimate for the direction of <U+03C3>3 suggested by Pahl et al., (1989) and Konietzky (1995). The SBH-3 borehole was drilled sub-horizontally towards the “best-estimate” direction of <U+03C3>2 with the goal of obtaining a direct measure of the sub-vertical stress from the hydrofracture stress tests. SBH-1 and SBH-3 were drilled into nearly undisturbed rock to observe the stress conditions in the ‘far-field’ of the shear zone. The SBH-4 borehole was sub-horizontal and drilled orthogonal to SBH-3 so as to penetrate one of the shear zones that were the target for the stimulations with the objective of identifying potential stress changes towards the fault.|","Document Type

P., University of Pittsburgh| Zolfaghari, N., University of Pittsburgh| Xing, P., University of Pittsburgh| Abell, B., W.D. Von Gonten Laboratories| Suarez-Rivera, R., W.D. Von Gonten Laboratories","|ABSTRACT: Numerical simulations of hydraulic fracture (HF) propagation through layered rocks show the effects of rock layering and interfaces on fracture height growth. When the contrast in properties between adjacent rock layers is high and abrupt, the resulting interface between these layers is often weak, exhibiting low tensile strength, low friction coefficient, and high hydraulic conductivity. Thus, they easily detach (in tension) and slip (in shear), as the hydraulic fracture crosses them, creating localized obstacles for fracture propagation as well as localized zones of fluid loss. Numerical simulations were conducted using the newly-implemented pore pressure cohesive elements as certain predefined hydraulic fracture and interface opening paths in ABAQUS 2016. To validate the model and for comparison we conducted simulations on elastically-homogeneous and elastically-layered rocks and, for the latter, we used a range of tensile strength and fluid flow properties at the interfaces between layers, to understand their impact on vertical hydraulic fracture (height) growth. Our results show a systematic decrease in fracture height and fracturing fluid efficiency with increasing interface hydraulic conductivity. This relationship is important because of its potential impact on improving fracture diagnostics in the field. We also observe that the interface strength directly affects fracture height growth as well as fluid efficiency. These findings are important for a proper assessment of fracture height growth, a better assessment of the created fracture surface area, and better predictions of well production.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing (HF) treatments have been widely used to enhance oil and gas production (Economides and Nolte, 2000; Holditch, 2006). Improving the representation of these treatments with more adequate numerical modeling is important because it helps to increase the created fracture surface area, to reduce completion costs, and to improve well production. When considering more complex reservoirs, such as shale and mudstone, numerical simulation of the hydraulic fracture treatments is considerably more challenging because of the layered nature of the rock and the impact of the associated interfaces of contact between layers, inhomogeneity, and pre-existing natural fractures on hydraulic fracture growth.|","Document Type

Examples show that for parallel fractures, the height growth may be promoted or suppressed depending on the relative fracture height. For fractures initiated from different formation layers, the fracture growth into the layer occupied by the other fractures is reduced due to the vertical stress shadowing effect.
1. INTRODUCTION
Interaction among multiple propagating hydraulic fractures or the so-called stress shadowing effect, especially its influence on fracture propagation path, has been previously studied for fractures initiated and growing in approximately the same formation layers. The stress shadowing effect can influence the height growth for fractures propagating in the same layer or in the different layers in depth. The interactions between fractures propagating in height in different vertical layers, has not been investigated yet and can have major implications on the success of a fracture treatment.
In this paper, we present a hydraulic fracture model that integrates the constant 3D Displacement Discontinuity Method (3D DDM) for computing the induced 3D stress field around the propagating hydraulic fractures and incorporates the induced stress into the fracture height calculations and propagation criterion.
The Displacement Discontinuity Method is currently widely used to model fracture propagation and interaction. Starting from the work of Crouch and Starfield (1983) this approach has been evolved from two dimensional constant DDM, to 2D quadratic and higher order DDM, accounting for the different element shapes. The 3D DDM approaches with constant, quadratic, and higher order discontinuities have also been investigated and attract great interest lately (Shou, 1993; Shou et al, 1997, Wu, 2015). Due to the excessive numerical computation cost associated with the implementation of the full 3D DDM approaches, several simplifications have been made. These simplifications include using 2D DDM with 3D correction factor to account for fracture height effect (Olson, 2004), using a simplified form of 3D DDM by neglecting the vertical displacement component, and using 3D height correction factor based on vertically uniform displacement discontinuity (Wu and Olson, 2015). The correction factors are derived from the analytical plane strain solution for a uniformly loaded vertical fracture of a finite height (Sneddon, 1946), so they are applicable mostly for the cases when the fractures are well contained in the same formation interval.|","Document Type

B., University of Waterloo","|ABSTRACT: Injection rate (Q) and viscosity (<U+03BC>) are key operational input parameters that can be varied to help attain a desired hydraulic fracture (HF) geometry. Putting viscosity effects aside, many have discussed the upper limit of injection rate and have uncritically promoted higher injection rates as leading to higher productivity in all cases. More recently, this approach has come into question as the links between injection approaches and rock mass properties (natural fractures, heterogeneity…) are explored and are becoming better understood. This paper focuses quantitatively on fluid injection rate and elastic modulus only, in the context of HF, through use of a commercial Discrete Element Method software program. Results indicate that low injection rates in different formations with different moduli of elasticity may lead to more desirable outcomes.
1. INTRODUCTION
With increasing use of Hydraulic Fracturing (HF) techniques in the Oil and Gas (O&G) industry, a greater need for more precise design and optimization is emerging, especially as low commodity prices squeeze profit margins are squeezed by. HF stimulation is considered successful when maximum O&G extraction rates (higher productivity) are achieved with minimum stimulation costs and environmental risks. Design is based on a sequential and iterative workflow rooted in exact (deterministic) simulations within regulatory and operational guidelines, informed by experience (Oyarhossein & Dusseault, 2016).
Intrinsic (e.g. stiffness, permeability) and extrinsic (e.g. stresses, pressures) parameters are needed to apply design workflows, so that the operational parameters during HF stimulation (rate, viscosity, pressure…) are appropriately chosen. HF stimulation may target a goal of higher short-term production (good for rapid payback), a goal of higher recovery factor (RF), or some combination of the two generally dictated by discounted cash flow analysis. In as much as can be ascertained, the goal of higher short-term production has dominated the shale gas and shale oil HF stimulation goals because of the sharp drop-off in well productivity with time.|","Document Type

T., Botswana International University of Science and Technology| Zvarivadza, T., University of the Witwatersrand","|ABSTRACT: A quantitative assessment of rock mass behaviors around underground excavations is essential in mining since it can assist engineers in selecting appropriate mining methods and implementing reliable ground control measures. In this paper, the interactions between the factors affecting the rock mass behaviors around underground excavations are quantified using the Rock Engineering Systems (RES) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches. To this end, the ground behavior index (GBI) is developed. The RES is applied as a practical tool for determining complex and highly nonlinear correlation among the input parameters via the interaction matrices while ANN is implemented to objectively assign weights to the input parameters of the GBI. Fall of ground (FoG) of rock mass surrounding the excavation comprising gravity induced structurally controlled, block movement and stress induced failure cases were investigated and a comprehensive database on the FoG characteristics was compiled. Several parameters related to the FoG including the rock mass characteristics, the excavation geometry, the excavation supports, the mining methods and the FoG size, were selected to establish the GBI. The Bamangwato Concession Limited (BCL), an underground mine located in Selibe-Phikwe, Botswana was used as case study to compute the proposed GBI. Overall, the validation results showed excellent agreement between the GBI and the field observations. It was concluded that the GBI could be used to provide engineers with reliable quantitative information on the fall of ground as well as the corresponding the hazard level.
1. INTRODUCTION
Falls of ground (FoG) or ground falls can be refereed as to the fall of loose rocks from excavation faces (roofs and side walls) typically unintentionally induced (as opposed to those purposely induced in some mining methods such as caving rock behind a longwall face, collapsing roof in a retreat room-and-pillar mine or caving rock in a block-caving hardrock mine). FoG combined with rockbursts have been responsible for numerous deaths and injuries in underground mines across the world (Adoko et al., 2013, Griffith et al., 2014). Mining operations have long recognized these hazards and have developed comprehensive programs, procedures, and ground support standards to address them. FoG in underground mines takes place in a wide range of geological and operational situations. The rock mass surrounding mine openings can collapse in different ways even if primary and secondary support systems are employed. These include rock falls, cave-in, raveling ground, squeezing ground, rock spalling, slabbing or bursting etc…from the roof and the sides/ribs of openings which can be structural or stress-induced. The potential types of ground instabilities are gravity induced structurally controlled, block movement and stress induced failures influenced by geological discontinuities and in situ stresses. It is imperative to examine the fall of ground mechanisms, failure mode, ground conditions and consequences to eliminate the hazards linked with this unwanted problem by coming with reliable and practical ways of enhanced technology and systematic engineering structure. Ground control measures which consist of ground characterization, ground support and reinforcement, work as a line of resistance line to lessen any form of ground movements (Kaiser and Cai, 2012). Ground control involves maintaining and preventing ground movements and predicting rock behavior in underground mine openings to a level that is deemed acceptable in terms of safety and serviceability. Therefore, the characteristics of FoG the assessment of rock mass behaviour around openings is essential in a mine since they have a great significance not only on the long term stability of underground excavations but also selecting appropriate mine design methods and implementing ground control measures.|","Document Type

H., University of Arizona","|ABSTRACT: The problem of thermal crack growth due to cold-water injection has been an important issue as a means of reservoir permeability enhancement in geothermal reservoirs. In this paper, we present numerical investigation of thermal crack growth in the vicinity of a borehole and a fracture during an injection period. The single and multiple fracture propagation caused by transient cooling are numerically modeled using the 2D boundary element method. First, we show the stress and temperature distributions on and near a single crack in an elastic domain to demonstrate the effect of transient cooling on the thermal stresses in a cooled zone. Then, we increase the number of cracks in the domain and consider interactions from multiple fractures and their propagation direction is investigated. In order to increase the accuracy of stress intensity factor calculation, the special crack tip displacement discontinuity element is implemented at the crack tip. Also, maximum principal stress criterion is used to determine crack growth trajectory. Numerical results indicate that the high thermal stresses due to cold-water injection can lead to initiation and propagation of secondary crack growth perpendicular to the main crack. Furthermore, the faster cooling rate produces longer crack growth of the thermal cracks.
1. INTRODUCTION
Thermal cracking has been regarded as a conventional reservoir stimulation technique to enhance reservoir permeability by thermal gradients in geothermal reservoirs. Thermal stress can change physical properties through thermal crack growth (Menendez et al., 1999) and can be initiated by the thermal expansion of the rock minerals as well as temperature gradients (Siratovich et al., 2015). Knowledge of how the thermal stresses influences surrounding rock formations is an essential key to understand the fracture permeability of these environments. In geothermal reservoir, when the rock is cooled by injection fluid colder than reservoir rock temperature, the rapid decrease in temperature induces thermal stresses which cause the thermal crack to initiate and propagate into the rock matrix. As the rock is kept cooled, the in-situ stresses near the cooled zone tend to decrease because of the induced tensile stresses and depending on the geometry of the zone, the orientation of the principal stresses can be reversed (Perkins and Gonzalez, 1985). Cooling can exceed the in-situ stresses in the reservoir, which results in the formation of secondary thermal crack growth. These cracks can also propagate into the rock formation, increasing reservoir permeability. On the other hand, this thermal loading not only changes the total stresses but also alters the pore pressure causing additional variation in an effective stress. In conventional reservoir stimulation (hydraulic fracking), the thermal coupling effect evolves quickly (time scale of hours to days), thus this effect may not have a huge influence on thermal cracking. However, if the injection has long periods (time scale of weeks to month), the coupling effect is hardly to be negligible (Tarasovs and Ghassemi, 2011). In this paper, the analysis of thermal crack growth due to transient cooling by cold water injection is numerically investigated. Propagation and interaction among thermal cracks in an elastic rock are considered. For the numerical approximation in this study, the elastic displacement discontinuity boundary element method is mainly used to solve thermal cracking problems. Also, the special elastic crack tip element is implemented for accurate crack tip modeling and stress intensity factor computation.|","Document Type

B., Louisiana State University| Al-Mudhafar, W. J., Louisiana State University","|ABSTRACT: In this paper, a pseudo-component black oil reservoir model was constructed to simulate CO2 flooding in shale oil reservoirs. The CO2 flooding was conducted using two different approaches: cyclic injection with 10 wells (5 producers and 5 injectors) and Huff-n-Puff with only 5 wells for injection and production with same number and length of fractures. The cyclic injection obtained 38% more cumulative oil during the thirty-year prediction period than the Huff-n-Puff process. Next, Design of Experiments and Proxy modeling was adopted for the optimization of hydraulic fracturing design through the cyclic CO2 flooding. Four factors were considered in the optimization: fracture half-length, primary width, permeability, and effective width. Many experiments were designed by mixing the levels of these four factors using Latin Hypercube Sampling. The optimization approach significantly improved the cyclic injection cumulative oil production by 12%. Two proxy models were constructed to obtain a simplified alternative metamodel to the large reservoir simulator. The RBF Neural Network created a much more accurate matching of cumulative oil production calculated from the simulator and predicted from the proxy model than the polynomial regression. The most influential fracturing factors were also identified for their effects on the shale oil reservoir performance.
1. INTRODUCTION
Of the astounding 400 billion barrels of shale play oil in the United States alone, less than 15% has been recovered through primary production (Yu et al., 2014). With such a large quantity of reserves still unrecovered, new and inventive Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) processes are required to continue production. One of the possible efficient EOR processes in unconventional reservoirs is CO2 flooding through hydraulic fractured horizontal wells. There are two main approaches of CO2 flooding: Huff-n-Puff and cyclic injection. The Huff-n-Puff process is made up of three steps: first, CO2 is injected (Huff); second, the well is shut in to allow the CO2 to propagate throughout the reservoir; third, the well is reopened and production resumes (Puff). The cyclic gas injection method is performed in the same manner with one key difference: separate wells are used for injection and production. These processes are well known in conventional sandstone reservoirs, but are very new technologies for shale formations with horizontal wells using hydraulic fracture modeling.|","Document Type

K., University of Utah","|ABSTRACT: Excavations associated with the production of stratified resources by longwall mining are of interest to the study of mining induced seismicity. By establishing the possibility of vertical displacement of overlaying strata into the void space opened by underground excavation, longwall mining inherently mobilizes a large quantity of gravitational potential energy. Potential energy is initially expended through strata deflection and a portion of this expended potential energy is released by fracture in roof strata, which have undergone elastic deformation. A portion of this released elastic energy is a source of seismic energy.
Considering an idealized mining geometry, a theoretical model accounting for the energy states associated with elastic deformation and brittle failure of roof strata has been developed. An increase in elastic strain energy, induced in single roof beams by self-weight, is shown to account for a corresponding decrease in the gravitation potential energy of the beams, which results from beam sag. Expressions for elastic strain energy released by brittle failure in single roof beams are developed. These analyses demonstrate that the elastic energy released by fracture of roof beams in strong, stiff, and thick strata is sufficient to release measurable seismic energy.
1. INTRODUCTION
Caving of overlaying strata behind an advancing longwall face constitutes a transformation of gravitational potential energy, due to the possibility of vertical displacement of overlaying strata into void space opened by underground excavation, to other forms of energy including strain energy, fracture energy, frictional energy, kinetic energy, and seismic energy. For catastrophic failures in underground mines, Whyatt and Varley, 2008, have proposed a direct relationship between seismic energy induced by mining and the change of gravitational potential energy in the overburden.
This work seeks to quantify the transformation of gravitational potential energy into strain energy using a simplified two-dimensional analysis, and considering the theoretical elastic behavior of roof strata induced by longwall excavation. The analysis assumes linear elasticity, material homogeny and isotropy, and static loading, and is simplified by considering roof strata as simply supported, built-in, and cantilevered beams.|","Document Type

S., Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences","|ABSTRACT: A new concept of cyclic hydraulic fracturing with cyclic injection was suggested to replace the conventional hydraulic fracturing with continuous injection to help reduce induced seismicity during fracturing. Proof of the concept was done in laboratory. Test results showed that 80% of the average breakdown pressure in continuous injection is able to induce hydraulic breakdown by cyclic injection, and the total number of cycles generally decreased with increasing maximum injection pressure. Induced seismicity reduction was confirmed based on acoustic emission monitoring results. Apertures of induced fractures in granite specimen were estimated through computed tomography (CT) images and they were relatively smaller in case of cyclic fracturing compared with conventional hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, injectivity index was calculated based on re-injection tests. The results of fracture aperture and injectivity index indicate that permeability enhancement effect for cyclic hydraulic fracturing is not as effective as conventional hydraulic fracturing considering isostatic loading condition. Hydraulic fracturing efficiency is expected to be improved by both modifying the cyclic injection style and considering hydro-shear by applying confining pressure and differential stresses to the samples.
1. INTRODUCTION
Deep geothermal energy is renewable energy with great potential for future use. However, intact rocks in deep underground are usually low permeable and hydraulic stimulation is necessary to create a permeable reservoir for extracting geothermal energy through water circulation. The induced seismicity during stimulation is a main concern and sometimes causes a controversy in public acceptance. New stimulation methods with less induced seismicity and at the same time ensuring permeability enhancement are necessary. Cyclic hydraulic fracturing or fatigue hydraulic fracturing, as it sometimes is called, is a stimulation method to achieve a fatigue failure through cyclic loading. This concept is firstly presented by Zang et al. (2013). The key point in fatigue hydraulic fracturing is the frequent lowering of the injection pressure by cyclic injection to allow stress relaxation at the fracture tips. As a result, it is expected induced seismicity will be relieved due to release of stress. Preliminary studies on the concept of the cyclic hydraulic fracturing have been done in recent years based on experiments and numerical simulations (Yoon et al. 2015; Zimmerman et al. 2015; Zhuang et al. 2016a). Differences in injection style and fracturing results between the cyclic hydraulic fracturing and the conventional hydraulic fracturing have been presented in these studies. Zang et al. (2017) performed underground fatigue hydraulic fracturing experiments on Avro granodiorite at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) and proved that total number and magnitude of seismic events are found to be smaller in the progressive treatment with frequent phases of depressurization compared to the conventional fracturing case with continuous water injection.|","Document Type

O., Louisiana State University| Radonjic, M., Louisiana State University| Du, H., Louisiana State University","|ABSTRACT: Subsurface fluids that are super-saturated can influence the extent to which defective natural caprocks are sealed. The convective transport of such fluids are of interest in other to provide effective containment for sequestered CO2 in targeted repositories. Fracture geometry largely govern fluid flow characteristics in deep micro-fractured formations, it has been postulated that the effect of mineralization can lead to flow impedance in the presence of favorable geochemical and thermodynamic conditions. Simulation results suggested that influx-induced mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions within clay-based sedimentary rocks can continuously close micro-fracture networks, though injection pressure and effective-stress transformation first rapidly expand the fractures. This experimental modelling research investigated the impact of in-situ geochemical precipitation on conductivity of fractures under carbon sequestration conditions. Geochemical analysis were performed on four samples of natural shale rocks, effluent fluids and recovered precipitates both before and after CO2-brine flooding at temperature and pressure conditions similar to that of the subsurface. Bulk rock geomechanical hardness was determined using Vickers’ micro-indentation. Differential pressure drop data across fractured composite core were also measured with respect to time over a five day period. This was used in estimating the conductivity of the artificially fractured cores. The estimates of 1st order pressure derivative and dimensionless fracture conductivity indicated that reactive transport of dissolved minerals in aqueous fluids can occlude micro-fracture flow paths in naturally fractured shale rocks.
1. INTRODUCTION
Shale caprocks constitute the majority of effective seals for geologic hydrocarbon bearing formations and are therefore of considerable interest in underground CO2 storage into depleted oil and gas formations (Vialle et al., 2016, Pawar et al., 2015). Porosity, permeability, fracture conductivity and other petrophysical properties of the seal rock are of importance in seal integrity analysis and can be numerically or experimentally determined (Wang et al., 2016, and Noh and Lake, 2002). Organic-rich shale is considered to have limited potential as membrane seals in CO2 containment (Hellevang et al., 2013, Olabode and Radonjic, 2013) Shale rocks are predominantly composed of clay (Olabode and Radonjic, 2014 and Wendler et al, 2012). They might also have other silica and carbonate based minerals that contribute to their geomechanical strength. The mineralogical components of a typical Pierre shale consists of quartz, feldspar, calcite, dolomite, pyrite, siderite and clays such as chlorite, kaolinite, illite and smectite. Reaction trends are very difficult to identify at any temperature in shale rock-fluid interaction. As the complex natural mineralogical composition envelops all reactions (Olabode and Radonjic, 2017). Furthermore, the instability of clay minerals in the presence of low-pH fluids has been observed when using subsurface fracturing fluids. Low-pH fluids are capable of dissolving clays and silicates. As temperature increases, the solubility of silici-clastic minerals is significantly increased especially in low-pH environment (Vialle et al., 2016). These findings are often observed when immersion tests are run on whole cores samples in the laboratory. This type of fluid-mineral reactions included dynamic processes that involve many effects: complex fluid flow, pore space changes, surface chemistry, and the mineral composition. Several clays have been observed swelling rapidly in the presence of depressed pH conditions and elevated temperature including sloughing or disappearance of swellable clays (Hensen and Smit, 2002). After minerals are dissolved in the low-pH fluids, they can precipitate in the formation pores, restricting fluid flow and leading to scaling and progressive geochemical aggregation (Armitage et al., 2010). Clay solubility and geochemical precipitation in dry-gas, low permeability formations have a definite effect on decreasing conductivity of proppant packs and fracture walls; formation matrix and surface chemistry play a significant role in this as well as pH, ionic strength and adsorption processes. Water from these fluids may exhibit hydrogen bonding effects with formation clays and cause swelling and sloughing.|","Document Type

Immediately after the rock slide event, the City utilized on-call geotechnical consultants to rapidly mobilize to site to perform an initial evaluation. Ground-based LiDAR, vegetation surveys and visual surveys were performed to make general assessments of rock slope stability, risk to property and building residents, and to provide the City with recommendations for temporary mitigation measures. Initial evaluations were also used as a basis for work plans for detailed geological mapping and to determine appropriate long-term remediation and ground support strategies. Empirical and kinematic methods were used to design long term rock slope stabilization measures using permanent rock anchors, shotcrete and rock mesh. Construction included extensive work performed on ropes, including vegetation grubbing, rock scaling, drilling for and installing double corrosion rock anchors, the grouting, tensioning and testing of rock anchors, shotcrete placement and high tensile strength steel wire mesh installation.
1. INTRODUCTION
A major rock fall occurred in the Telegraph Hill area of San Francisco on January 23, 2012, causing property damage to the Parc Telegraph Building at 240 Lombard Street (Fig. 1, 2). A team of geological and geotechnical engineers from San Francisco Public Works (SFPW), Arup and Robert Y Chew Geotechnical (RYCG) responded by visiting the site on the day of the rock fall and completing an emergency evaluation of the existing rock slope, including geological conditions, potential threat from further falls, and proposed temporary mitigation measures.
In the months following the rock fall, further assessment of the site was performed to determine appropriate long-term remediation strategies that would reduce the potential for future rock falls which could impact the surrounding area, including the Parc Telegraph Residential Complex. Plan, specification and cost estimate packages were prepared for the Center Slope and Upper Slope by the Arup/RYCG joint venture and for the Lower Slope by Cotton, Shires and Associates. City budget limitations prompted the SFPW to split the work into two phases based on a high level risk assessment. The Center and Lower portions of the rock slope were prioritized as they were considered to pose a greater hazard to human life and property at the base of the slope (Fig. 3). Construction of the Phase 1 rock slope improvements (Central and Lower Slope) were completed in early 2015. Construction of the Phase 2 rock slope improvements (Upper Slope) were completed in late 2016.|","Document Type

The RQD represents a basic element of several classification systems. In this paper, scale effects for RQD measurements are studied using synthetic rock masses generated by means of Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models. RQD measurements are performed for rock masses with varying fracture intensity and by changing the orientation of the simulated borehole to account for orientation bias. The objective is to demonstrate the existence of a Representative Elementary Length (REL, 1D analogue of a 3D Representative Elementary Volume, or REV) above which RQD measurements would represent an average indicator of rock mass quality. For the synthetic rock masses, calculation of RQD measurements were also performed using the relationship proposed by Priest and Hudson (1967) and compared to the simulated RQD measurements along the boreholes. A DFN generated for a room-and-pillar mine using mapped field data is then used as an initial validation of the results, which are preliminary in nature. It is planned to use several other case studies to further validate the results of the current study.
1. INTRODUCTION
Assigning numbers to geology requires a delicate balance between the commonly held opinion that geology cannot be quantified and an engineering approach that attempts to assign precise mathematical terms to every physical quantity (Hoek, 1999). Rock mass classification systems can be viewed as attempts to formalize this balance in terms of the ratings given to several rock mass parameters. For instance, the Rock Quality Designation index (RQD) was developed by Deere (Deere et al., 1967) to provide a quantitative estimate of rock mass quality from drill core logs. RQD is defined as the cumulative length of intact core pieces longer than 10 cm as a percentage of the total length of core (Figure 1); RQD ratings are given in Table 1. RQD represents a fundamental parameter in several rock mass classification systems, including the Rock Mass Rating (RMR, Bieniawski, 1976) and the Rock Quality, Q index (Barton et al., 1974). More recently, Hoek et al. (2013) have proposed a quantification of the original Geological Strength Index (GSI, Hoek et al., 1995) that incorporates RQD. The advantage of the RQD is largely due to its simple definition; however, the RQD index is known to be sensitive to the relative orientation of the fractures with respect to the orientation of the borehole (or scanline). RQD values may also depend on the experience of the engineer logging the core and the ability to distinguish natural fractures from drill and core handling induced fractures.|","Document Type

Strength properties and their anisotropy were investigated in order to aid the interpretation of the hydraulic-fracturing stress measurements conducted in boreholes drilled down 70-meters from the 4850’ level (1478 meters depth) of the mine. Brazilian disc and triaxial lab tests were conducted on these cores as well as cores previously obtained as part of the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) program. Emphasis on how the orientation of the foliation in the schist relative to the loading direction affects the respective strengths of the rocks was monitored. Brazilian disc tensile strengths ranged between 2.7-4.84 MPa when loaded parallel to the foliation, whereas strengths ranged between 5.82-12.01 MPa when loaded perpendicular to foliation, indicating tensile strength anisotropy. Triaxial tests also indicated anisotropy in static and dynamic elastic properties and strength anisotropies when loaded parallel and perpendicular to the foliation direction. UCS results yielded an average value of 107.4 MPa for triaxial samples loaded parallel to foliation, and 88.1 MPa for samples loaded foliation perpendicular to foliation. Young’s Modulus results indicated a 17.5% increase between samples loaded parallel to foliation compared to perpendicular.
1. INTRODUCTION
Under the kISMET project, supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) SubTER (Subsurface Technology and Engineering Research, Development and Demonstration) crosscut initiative, fluid injection tests were performed in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), formerly known as the Homestake Mine, in order to monitor the behavior of hydraulic fractures using in-situ geophysical monitoring. The motivation behind the kISMET project was to study stress measurements and fracture stimulation with accompanying borehole monitoring to characterize relations between stress, induced fractures, and rock fabric (Intermediate-Scale Hydraulic Fracturing in a Deep Mine, kISMET Project Summary, 2016) Prior to the main fluid injection, several hydraulic fracturing stress measurements were conducted in boreholes drilled down 70-meters from the 4850’ level (1478 meters depth) of the mine to characterize the in-situ stress state needed for later interpretation of the geophysical data.|","Document Type

In particular, the discrimination of shale vs. non-shale layers significantly influences the quality of pore pressure prediction and wellbore stability analyses. Shales are typically associated with a combination of relatively high densities, relatively high gamma ray signals and low resistivity, with relatively good consistencies within a formation. Therefore, relationships obtained from one well can oftentimes be employed in nearby wells. However, exact relationships do not usually apply to wells in other formations. Local calibrations are therefore required. When done by humans, the careful and considerate picking of shale intervals is often very time consuming, and different practitioners frequently produce different interpretations. In this paper we evaluate whether these drawbacks can be resolved by employing a machine learning method. Linear logistic regression is evaluated as a method for binary classifying of shale vs. non-shale lithology using log data from vertical wells located in a basin within the United States that contains predominantly gas resources. The lithology column characterization is based on sandy - shale formations throughout the reservoir; it was interpreted by analyzing the behavior of density, gamma ray, resistivity, compressional and shear slowness logs. Prediction results with training and test data from a single well and cross-well predictions on new, unseen data demonstrate remarkable performance. Our results indicate that machine learning methods with adequately trained classifiers have the potential to automate shale picking.
1. INTRODUCTION
Machine learning methods are increasingly deployed to benefit our daily activities. These methods are frequently performed to expedite operations or to assist with laborious assignments. The benefits of employing machine learning methods include increased speed of execution, reproducibility and consistency.
These methods have also been evaluated for petrophysical and geomechanical analyses and interpretations, which are commonly performed by human experts on the basis of log data and, when available, seismic and coring data. Comparing several classification methods Zhao et al. (2015) have concluded that supervised learning methods can provide accurate facies classification, and that unsupervised learning methods can expose features that might otherwise be overlooked. Support vector machines (e.g., Torres and Reveron, 2013; Zhao et al., 2014; Al-Mudhafar, 2015) and a neural networks (Smith et al., 1991; Wong et al., 1995; Westphal and Bornholdt, 1996) have been applied with various levels of success.|","Document Type

"648","2017-0763","Simulation of Hydraulic Fracture Clusters Considering Viscosity and Toughness Dominated Propagation","Sesetty, V., University of Oklahoma| Ghassemi, A., University of Oklahoma","|ABSTRACT: In fluid driven fractures, energy is dissipated by creating new fracture surfaces and overcoming viscous resistance to fluid flow. It is known that when fluid driven fractures propagate in a rock with a finite amount of resistance to fracture, the toughness (<U+03BE>1/2) and viscosity (<U+03BE>2/3) solutions for the fracture aperture co-exist near the fracture tip. Depending on the ratio of viscous dissipation and fracture resistance, the region for the validity of each tip asymptote varies. In this paper, we developed a 2D displacement discontinuity based hydraulic fracture propagation model for multiple large-scale hydraulic fracture propagation while taking into account the multi-scale nature of the fracture tip. The numerical model is capable of distinguishing between viscosity and toughness dominated propagation regimes, and takes into account their corresponding solutions as boundary conditions near the fracture tips. We provide numerical examples of large-scale multiple fracture propagation in a rock with finite fracture toughness using injection fluid viscosities range from 1-1000 cP. The results include fracture geometry, aperture distribution and regime of fracture propagation. To study the effect of fracture tip asymptote on the resulting fracture cluster, we approximated multi-scale fracture tip asymptotes with toughness asymptote showing that for a rock with finite toughness and for the range of fluid viscosities considered, the toughness solution provides sufficiently accurate results irrespective of the regime of fracture propagation.
1. INTRODUCTION
The fracture propagation problem according to LEFM theory assumes square root variation of crack opening displacement (or square root asymptote u <U+2248> x1/2), near the crack tips, where u is the opening near crack tip and x is the distance from crack tip. This behavior is modeled by a special crack tip element in boundary element methods. In LEFM, fracture propagation is governed by a material property called fracture toughness which is related to fracture energy. But fracture energy is only one of the sources of energy dissipation mechanisms during hydraulic fracture propagation. Energy is also consumed to overcome the resistance of flow of viscous fluids in the fracture channel, which is called viscosity dissipation. If the viscous energy dissipation is significantly larger than the energy dissipated in creating new fracture surfaces, the fracture is assumed to be propagating under a viscosity dominated regime. In this scenario, fracture propagation is assumed to be completely governed by fluid dynamics of viscous flow and is independent of fracture toughness (Spence and Sharp 1985, Lister 1990, Desroches et al., 1994). This kind of behavior could be observed when fluid is injected into pre-existing fractures (where fracture resistance is negligible) or flow of magma in fractures (Spence& Turcotte 1985) or inducing hydraulic fractures using high viscous fluids in petroleum reservoirs. On the other hand, if viscous dissipation is negligible compared to the energy required to create new fracture surfaces (in the cases of rocks with very high fracture toughness), the fracture propagation can occur under toughness dominated regime where the propagation behavior is completely controlled by fracture toughness. Therefore the main controlling parameters of fracture propagation regime are viscosity of the fluid and the rock fracture resistance.|","Document Type

The model has been developed to address hydraulic fracture propagation; it’s interaction with natural fractures (crossing/arrest) and transition of natural fractures (closed joint elements) to hydraulic fractures. The natural fracture elements (fracture opening supported by asperities and fluid pressure) and hydraulic fracture elements (fracture opening supported fully by fluid pressure) are treated separately in the model. Using a relationship between fracture closure and effective stress and by specifying stiffness of asperities, the amount of the closure experienced by natural fractures is determined. The effect of pore pressure distribution and induced stresses due to fracture deformation on natural fracture slip is studied. The results include injection pressure response, network geometry and fracture conductivities for the rock masses under different in-situ stress anisotropy. We find fluid diversion into natural fracture can initiate wing fracture growth while the parent fracture is still mechanically closed. Induced stresses alone have negligible effect on slippage of isolated natural fractures. Also, small deformations of natural fractures due to the initial in-situ stress state has negligible impact on hydraulic fracture propagation.
1. INTRODUCTION
The potential of unconventional plays has greatly improved with the recent advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology. Unconventional reservoirs such as shales are naturally fractured rock systems. Micro-seismic events are often associated with stimulation of these reservoirs, which can be attributed to shear displacement of natural fractures due to induced stresses and pore pressure changes. Interpreting fracture characteristic alone from micro-seismic monitoring (MSM) can be difficult since the proper cause of events is unknown and also the uncertainty associated with the location of observation well. As a result, complex fracture models are used in conjunction with micro-seismic imaging to estimate reservoir stimulation volume, hydraulic fracture and natural fracture characteristics (e.g., Lu and Ghassemi, 2017). However, the present large scale complex fracture models usually are simplified to reduce computational cost and increase robustness. Semi-analytical models (Weng et al., 2011) cannot take stress shadow between fractures into account accurately. Models based on predefined fracture locations (McClure, 2012) and discrete fracture networks (e.g., Willis-Richards et al., 1996; Wang and Ghassemi, 2011; Raihi and Damjanac, 2013) are more suitable for injection extraction problems than hydraulic fracture stimulation. FEM based models (Fu et al., 2011) are not suitable for field scale simulations. Fully coupled fluid flow - fracture deformation models (Zhang et al., 2009; Sesetty and Ghassemi, 2012; Dahi-Taleghani and Olson, 2011) exists but are limited to few small scale fractures.|","Document Type

O., Louisiana State University","|ABSTRACT: Shale cap rocks are nature’s best hydraulic barrier geomaterials. They are effective seals for underground hydrocarbon bearing formations as well as CO2 storage formations in carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. The sealing properties of shale rocks are directly related to its minerals and the internal arrangement of clay and non-clay minerals. This is known as the microstructure. Since shales are predominantly composed of clay minerals, the type and amount of clay minerals contained within the rock are the key factors of its sealing properties. The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of how different types of clays behave in a typical CO2 storage reservoir condition.
Clay minerals have layered structures which often carry negative surface charges. The combination of large reactive surface areas and charge bring complexity in terms of their reactivity to fluids. Therefore, even the same type of clays can have different properties depending on their depositional environment, which was influenced by different fluid properties (pH, T, P, salinity). The same is also true of the exposure of clay-rich rocks to reactive fluids during geologic times as well as under subsurface engineering conditions (nuclear waste storage, injection of waste water and fracking fluids in oil&gas, and carbon sequestration). For this study, artificial shale rock samples were designed using purified natural minerals in different ratios. These samples allowed us to observe the impact of the mineralogical composition on mechanical properties and obtain a systematically quantified comparison between samples. Indentation tests were conducted to evaluate changes in mechanical properties as a result of composition alteration, while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to probe any changes to microstructures. Observations in this study indicate: a) high clay content shale formation has better sealing properties because its mechanically more stable and has lower permeability due to the low porosity; b) increasing the salinity of pore fluid can decrease the thickness of double layers of clays, causing an increase in permeability because of the increase of effective porosity. Salinity has an additional weaker effect on the mechanical properties because as the sample dries, salt crystallized within the sample and creates an internal expansion force resulting in integrity failure.
1. INTRODUCTION
Caprocks are essentially defined as low permeability formations, and sometimes, but not necessarily, with low porosity. More than 60% of effective seals for geologic hydrocarbon bearing formations which act as natural hydraulic barriers constitute shale caprocks (Allen and Allen, J.R., 2005). The effectiveness of cap rock depends on its ability to immobilize fluids, which include a low permeability and resilience to the in-situ formation of fractures as a result of the pressurized injection. The alteration in sealing properties of shale rocks is directly related to the differences in its mineralogical composition and microstructure.|","Document Type

M., Aramco Services Company: Aramco Research Center - Houston| Brown, J. P., Red Sea Exploration Division| Sibon, H. J., Red Sea Exploration Division| Zuhlke, R., EXPEC Advanced Research Center","|ABSTRACT: Layered evaporite sequences have been documented from various rifted margins, including the South Atlantic and the Red Sea. The intervening sedimentary layers in such sequences can undergo large deformation and present drilling hazards associated with high pore fluid pressures and/or rubble zones. Although physical and numerical models provide insights to the deformation of such layers, the former are limited in terms of scalability of material failure parameters to natural examples, while the latter predominantly focus on massive salt and adjacent frictional-plastic sediments. In this paper we present a 2D evolutionary large strain finite element model of a salt diapir in an idealized layered evaporite sequence (LES). Gravitational loading and sedimentation provide the driving force for halokinesis. Salt is assigned a temperature-dependent non-Newtonian rheology, whereas the sediments are assigned a non-associative cap-plasticity model that supports both compaction and shear localization. The model results suggest that mechanical stratification plays an prominent role in the evolution of a LES. Stresses and strains in the sediment layers evolve in a complex manner and are predominantly controlled by their structural position. The presence of multiple salt layers in a LES decouples the deformation at different depths such that poly-harmonic folds can develop near the salt diapir. Structural dip and position, in addition to curvature, impact the deformation within the sedimentary layers. Geomechanical forward models also provide directional guidance on the likely variations in in-situ stresses and in well planning in LES settings.
1. INTRODUCTION
A Layered Evaporite Sequence (LES) is a compositionally stratified heterolithic sequence comprising salt(s) and sediments. Some examples of salt basins containing layered evaporites are the Brazilian salt basins (Fiduk and Rowan, 2012), Levant Basin (Cartwright et al., 2012), North Sea (Strozyk et al., 2012), South Oman salt basin (Li et al., 2012) and Lower Permian Basin (Raith et al., 2016). The stratification in a LES could be due to spatial variations in salt composition (e.g., halite, anhydrite, tachyhydrite, carnallite) or inter-layering of salt with sedimentary inclusions or ‘stringers’. During geological loading, evaporites in a LES could undergo viscous deformation while the inter-layered sediments deform by frictional-plastic processes. The bulk mechanical response of a LES to geological loading can be significantly different, than when the salt is compositionally homogeneous, such as in the massive allochthonous halite structures in the Gulf of Mexico.|","Document Type

And it is also important to determine how the fracture extends as well as the properties of fracturing fluid and proppant in hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracture width is 3-4 orders of magnitude less than the length and the height. Because fracture width is very tiny and the reservoir is at great depth, fracture width can only be determined through model estimation or numerical simulations. At present, even in the laboratory conditions, no direct measurement of fracture width is possible. This article is based on Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) strain sensor and strain transfer theory. The hydraulic fracturing is controlled by great stress difference and prefabricated fracture direction in the true-triaxial rock test equipment. FBG strain sensors are distributed in the fracture propagation direction to monitor fracture behavior. So dynamic monitoring hydraulic fracture width in concrete materials can be realized in laboratory. The entire process of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation is recorded by FBG strain sensors during hydraulic fracturing, with various stages of micro-fractures, macro-fractures and width changes. By multiple FBG strain sensors, displacements of fracture process zone before hydraulic fracture reaches FBG and fracture widths when the hydraulic fracture is crossing FBG are obtained. Then we found the speed and the shape of fracture in the process of hydraulic fracture propagation. Data show that fracture width does not increase monotonously with hydraulic fracture extension in the process of hydraulic fracturing. It fluctuates within a certain range along with the fracture extension.
1. INTRODUCTION
In the 1950s, with the emergence of hydraulic fracturing technology, oil and gas development has entered a new stage (Hassebroek and Waters, 1964). Hydraulic fracturing as an unconventional oil and gas extraction technique, high pressure water-sand slurries are pumped into reservoirs to fracture rock with low permeability to extract oil and gas(Nolte, 2000). This technology has led to a significant increase in oil and gas production (T.g. Fan and G.q. Zhang, 2014). In this process, the hydraulic fracture width has a great effect on the fracturing effect.

C., Imperial College London","|ABSTRACT: In quarries and mines, blocky rock masses are transformed by fracture of intact rock by the action of the detonation pressure of explosives, the blastpile fragment size distribution ultimately controlling the economics. Rock fragmentation prediction and blast design continues to this day to follow largely empirically calibrated equations. One source of inaccuracy of models such as Kuz-Ram is likely to be the lumping together of so-called uncontrollable i.e. geological parameters into one blastability factor to characterize the rock mass. Recent developments in numerical modelling have introduced the sophistication necessary to capture more of the key nonlinear and coupled processes that occur during rock blasting and to consider intact rock properties and jointing or discontinuities independently. The discontinuous computational approach adopted here is based on the combine finite-discrete element method (FEMDEM) coupled to a FEM multi-phase gas flow model with full equation of state. The fragment size distributions are compared for idealised scenarios drawn from simulated blasts with isotropic intact rock, rock with persistent and impersistent discontinuity sets i.e. with rock bridge ratios and different discontinuity spacing, all for identical detonation gas pressure. Results are discussed in the context of the rock structure’s effect on the dominant mechanisms of fragmentation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock fragmentation by blasting is employed widely in mining and quarrying and is by far the most efficient initial method of comminution, see for example the extensive literature on blasting, e.g. Persson et al. (1993), JKMRC (1996), Jimeno et al. (1997). The economic and environmental drivers of these industries are highly dependent on the fragmentation size distribution as downstream load and haul and crusher efficiencies depend on such yield curves. Fragmentation prediction models are typically designed to combine practical bench and drill-hole layout geometries, sound physical principles based on explosive energy concentration to provide empirically derived size distribution outputs often characterised by best-fit two- or three-parameter cumulative distribution functions. The rock mass properties are acknowledged to be problematic for the prediction. On the commonly made assumption that a mine site or quarry site has a certain local geology, the blast designer is often content to use just one composite index for the blastability parameter in the model and perform field site adjustments based on actual blasting results. Prediction of blasted block size distributions, BBSDs (fragmentation curves, yield curves) is the subject of significant research effort as the possible error in prediction remains very high. Accuracy is limited because the geological conditions cannot easily be determined for every blast and the implementation of the blast design may suffer from practical constraints. Four approaches to fragmentation prediction were discussed in the context of quarry aggregates and large block (armourstone) production in Latham et al., (2006).|","Document Type

From the view of combinatorial theory, recent advances in block theory are discussed in this paper. Especially the intersecting ways and combination relationships between the free planes of the rock blocks are analyzed generally. Therefore, the convex blocks in the classical block theory can be extended to the non-convex blocks which include the concave intersections between the free planes. Viewing a non-convex block as a combination of several convex blocks, the identification criteria of finiteness and removability for non-convex blocks can be established through analyzing the relationships between the combined block and its sub blocks. Aiming at the redundancy in the combination algorithm of exhaustive enumeration method, a new symbolic representation of blocks can be established. Then a cutting algorithm for the residual block is designed. Finally, the optimized combination analysis for the non-convex block can be realized.
1. INTRODUCTION
In the process of excavation for rock engineering, a frequently encountered problem is the stability of rock mass. The essence of studying the stability is to study the change mechanism and the stress distribution of rock mass after excavation. Block theory is a kind of rock mass stability analysis method based on limit equilibrium theory. But geometric analysis by the occurrence of joint planes is a major feature of it. Block theory has the advantages such as strict mathematical basis, less input parameters, fast calculation and practical results. And it has been widely applied in many large-scale projects like Three Gorges Project.
The publication of the paper “Stereographic projection method for the stability analysis of rock mass” (Shi, 1977) in Chinese by Gen-hua Shi at Scientia Sinica in 1977 marks the preliminary formation of block theory. And then a rigorous mathematical proof was made for it (Shi, 1982). In 1985, the publication of the book, “Block Theory and Its Application to Rock Engineering” (Goodman and Shi, 1985), which is written commonly by R. E. Goodman and Genhua Shi, marks the formal formation of the system of block theory. Since the block theory proposed, many scholars including Dr. Shi himself have put forward some new development, which is considered from the geometric and the physical characteristics of joint planes (Shi, 2006), mechanical behaviors of blocks combined with the modern mathematical methods. These developments can be summarized as six kinds of methods [4-7], that is, discontinuous deformation analysis (Shi, 1988), numerical manifold method, stochastic network simulation (Zhang et al., 2007), key group method, fractal geometry and stereo-analytical method, elastic-viscous-plastic method (Li et al., 2010).|","Document Type

This risk is mainly caused by natural fracture propagating. Therefore, drilling fluid with solid plugging materials is used to plug the natural fractures to prevent them from propagation. However, the prevention may fail when the drilling fluid leaks through the solid plugging material and alters the fracture tip. Once the drilling fluid effect is strong enough, the natural fracture would be instable and begin to grow. This paper investigated this influence of the drilling fluid on the fracture tip, especially on the stress intensity factor, which is a parameter to determine the stability of the fracture. A model was developed to describe stress distribution in the fracture where is filled with the solid plugging materials and drilling fluid. The stress intensity factor was studied using this model to test the fracture instability. The paper could also help with evaluation and optimization of solid plugging materials when drilling in the naturally fractured formations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Lost circulation is a serious problem during drilling. In naturally fractured formations, this problem is mainly caused by the regrowth of the natural fracture. Thus, solid plugging materials, like walnut shell, are necessary to plug natural fractures (Feng and Gray, 2017). This paper is to develop a compressible, two-phase, water-gas flow system to investigate the influence of the drilling fluid on stress intensity factor (SIF) at the fracture tip when the fracture is filled with solid plugging materials.
SIF is a mathematical parameter and used to describe the stress intensity of the fracture tip. The SIF is relevant to the geometry (size and shape) and stress distribution near the fracture tip. Liebowitz (1971) indicated that fractures became unstable once the value of SIF at the fracture tip reached a critical value. This critical value was called fracture toughness. Hence, SIF could be used to predict fracture stability. Erodogan et al. (1973&1974) studied the stability of fractures in layered medium when considering materials of the medium, sizes, and positions of the fracture. Yew and Lodde (1983), based on a mathematical model, investigated the propagation of hydraulically induced fractures in layered medium. Yew and Chiou (1983) studied the influence of in-situ stress and layered materials on fracture propagation. Biot and Medlin (1983) developed a mathematical model, based on Laplace's equation, to study the prerequisite of the fracture penetration through the interface. Lu and Yew (1985) considered the SIF as the standard to determine the fracture stability and to predict the direction of crack growth. Morita et al. (1988) evaluated SIF in a three-dimensional fracture model that was applied to arbitrary planar cracks. Chen Z. and Chen M. (1997) studied the vertically hydraulically induced fracture and analyze the effect of fracture toughness. Martin (2000) found that the zone of plastically deformed material around the fracture tip could affect SIF and crack growing. Chen et al. (2001, 2002, 2003) analyzed wellbore stability in naturally fractured formations when mud invades fractures. They investigated SIF when the fracture propagation was simulated. Overall, SIF is a significant factor when studying fractures. However, few previous studies considered the effect of solid plugging materials on SIF.|","Document Type

Tests are performed in 61-cm (2-foot) cubic sand packs with controlled 3-D confining stresses. Each test consists of multiple water injection stages, at hydraulic fracturing and flooding conditions. Fluids are injected through the wellbore containing a wire mesh screen wrapped outside or inside of a section of pre-drilled liner, representing an open hole stand-alone screen (OH-SAS) or open hole pre-drilled liner (OH-PDL) completion, respectively. Wellbore injection pressure and pore pressures inside the sand pack are measured to enable calculations of skin pressure drop as a function of injection rates. Results show wellbore pressure and skin pressure drop increase with injection rate. OH-SAS shows lower pressure than OH-PDL while the morphology of invaded zone are similar. A mechanism for the increasing skin pressure drop as a function of injection rate and completion design is proposed. Practical implications to injector design and surveillance operations are discussed.
1. INTRODUCTION
Water injectors with injectivity decline (Olatunji et al., 2014) and out of zone fracturing injection (Schultz et al., 2016) impact recovery and present possible environmental risks. To help understand the physics of high rate injection into unconsolidated sands and mitigate the associated risks experimental and numerical studies (Chudnovsky et al., 2015, Golovin et al., 2011 and 2010) have been reported. This paper presents experimental results on the mechanisms and performance of two injection completion designs with cohesionless sand pack. In Section 2 we describe the equipment, experimental setup, sand pack preparation and testing protocols. The post-test data evaluation is described and discussed in Section 3. The summary and conclusions constitute the final Section 4.
2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND TESTING PROGRAM
The equipment used in this study has been specifically developed for conducting matrix flooding and fracturing experiments under true 3-D stress conditions, with variable injection rate and injection fluid composition. In particular, the cubical testing chamber has a removable top plate, heavily reinforced side and bottom plates and turning mechanism facilitating the initial loading and compaction of the sand pack, as well as post-test excavation and analysis of the sand pack. Although the experimental setup used in this study has been described previously (Golovin et al, 2011), improvements and changes have been made to carry out experiments in this study.

Laboratory measurements represent a valuable source of such data. In particular, the relation between the two parameters is of interest, since both parameters are rarely measured with the same rocks. Here, experimental data obtained with weak sedimentary rocks (Castlegate sandstone, Mons chalk and Mancos shale) are presented, including unconfined Mode I fracture toughness and direct tensile strength. The angular dependence of both parameters is explored with the shale samples and compared to previously measured anisotropy of the Brazilian tensile strength. The new data are in accord with previous correlations between tensile strength and fracture toughness. The need for performing such measurement under stress conditions realistic for in situ fracturing is pointed out. |1. INTRODUCTION |Hydraulic fracturing is a key to make unconventional (shale gas and shale oil) reservoirs profitable. In general, hydraulic fractures can make an important contribution to increased recovery in conventional low permeability reservoirs. Identification of so-called sweet spots for placing of fractures is often based on the ability of the rock to fracture, expressed in terms of various parameters referred to as e.g. ""frackability"" or ""brittleness"". However; mathematical modeling of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation depends on rock parameters like tensile strength and fracture toughness, in addition to in situ stress conditions. To what extent the pragmatic ""frackability"" approach and the more fundamental fracture mechanics approach may be brought to convergence is not clear. Meanwhile, the question remains as to what kind of input data that is required and how they should be used for optimizing fracturing operations in the field. |In this paper, we present standardized laboratory measurements with three relatively weak rocks, including Castlegate sandstone, Mons chalk and Mancos shale. Fracture toughness was measured using the Chevron Bend (CB) method with three point loading. Direct tensile strength tests were performed and compared to previous tests of Brazilian tensile strength (Simpson et al., 2014). A primary aim was to identify possible correlations between these differently measured strength parameters, and to evaluate the reliability of the various measurements for realistic modeling of fracture initiation and propagation.|","Document Type

Two empirical correlations of the relative velocity between the fluid and proppant for the vertical direction (settling) and the horizontal direction (retardation) are incorporated in the model. This model can simulate fully 3-D fracture growth in poro-elasto-plastic materials with tensile and shear failure. A cohesive zone model is used for fracture propagation along with a dynamic and adaptive meshing procedure. We investigate the effect of fluid viscosity, injection rate, proppant diameter, and reservoir permeability on proppant placement. Higher apparent viscosity fluid and injection rate results in wider fractures with better proppant placement, when the fracture is expected to be contained within the payzone. In the case of fracpacks, utilizing larger diameter of proppant leads to settling-dominant proppant placement rather than the retardation-dominant due to the relatively wider induced fracture. The effect of fluid leak-off and the pore pressure diffusion in the reservoir is captured. Higher leak-off in the high permeability sands leads to a poroelastic backstress that builds up around the fracture, and results in a shorter fracture due to larger leak-off. This new frac-pack model allows us to design and analyze hydraulic fracturing stimulations in soft, elasto-plastic formations when rheologically complex fracturing fluids are used. Our results also provide guidelines for the selection of fracturing fluid rheology, proppant size, and injection rates.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a widely applied well stimulation technique that has been utilized for more than 60 years in the oil and gas industry (King, 2012). This stimulation technique has been mainly used for hard and tight rocks which exhibit low permeability and linear-elastic behavior. Unconsolidated or poorly consolidated reservoirs also require hydraulic fracturing operations, so-called frac-pack completions. Frac-packing combines fracturing and sand control into one technique (Marquez et al., 2013). The fracture induced by a high-viscosity fluid helps to improve production rates, and to place proppant within fractures and in the annulus between the screen and casing in order to prevent formation sand production.|","Document Type

An innovative numerical method is presented, here, for modeling fluid-driven fractures propagation considering changing in the primary energy loss mechanism during propagation. The proposed method is based on the extended finite element methods with modifications to incorporate variable stress singularity at the crack tips for the transition between toughness-dominated and viscosity-dominated regimes. Moreover, a consistent enriched function is introduced for fluid pressure calculations close to the fracture tips to catch its singularity. The numerical results were validated against the analytical solutions for two extreme hydraulic fracture propagation regimes. Mesh independency and convergence rate of the proposed method are verified. Comparison between fracture volumes assuming changing in the primary energy loss mechanism and constant primary energy loss mechanism during hydraulic fracture propagation is provided.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing plays an important role for economic production from low-permeability reservoirs around the world (Holditch, 2006). To make hydraulic fracturing treatment more effective and avoid possible losses of reserves due to screen out, it is crucial to simulate the treatment before its execution. However, even for simple fracture geometries many commercial available simulators do not consider coupling between the rock deformation and fluid flow. The proposed method covers this drawback and proposes an accurate method to simulate hydraulic fractures propagation for different regimes dictated by rock and fracturing fluid parameters.
The main struggle while modeling hydraulic fracturing problems comes from coupling the fluid flow inside the fracture and the rock deformations. Other difficulties are moving boundary conditions while hydraulic fracture propagates, non-linearity of governing equation for the fluid flow inside the fractures, and pressure singularity near the fracture tips. Moreover, the analytical solutions are only available for simple geometries and limiting assumptions (Detournay, 2004).
Nevertheless, analytical solutions of the hydraulic fracturing problems allow us to identify three main energy dissipation mechanisms are existing during hydraulic fracturing treatment. The first mechanism is related to fracturing the rock, the second mechanism is related to energy losses because of the friction losses, and the third mechanism is due to leak off. In this work, we are focusing on the toughness and viscosity dominated regimes in an impermeable media. Adachi (2001) introduced dimensionless toughness (equation) or dimensionless viscosity M as the dimensionless number that allow determining primary dissipation mechanism|","Document Type

1 INTRODUCTION
Rock differs from most other engineering materials in that it contains discontinuities such as joints, bedding planes, folds, sheared zones and faults which render its structure discontinuous. Rock mechanics may be applied to many engineering applications ranging from dam abutments, to nuclear power station foundations, to the manifold methods of mining ore and aggregate materials, to the stability of petroleum wellbores and including newer applications such as geothermal energy and radioactive waste disposal.
Rock mechanics is mostly concerned with rock on the scale that appears in engineering and mining work, and so it might be regarded as the study of the properties and behavior of accessible rock due to changes in stresses or other conditions. Two distinct problems are always involved: (i) The study of the orientations and properties of the joints, and (ii) The study of the properties and fabric of the rock between the joints. In any practical investigation in rock mechanics, the first stage is a geological and geophysical investigation to establish the lithologies and boundaries of the rock types involved. The different types of matrixes are available on site such as (1) Polyhedral block (2) Equidimensional block (3) Prismatic block (4) Tabular block (5) Rhombohedral block (6) Columnar block.

The powerhouse at Mayo was constructed adjacent to a 70 m high heterogeneous rock and soil slope with minimal catchment between the slope and the powerhouse building. Following a series of near misses and actual impacts from rock fall onto the roof and sidewall of the building, Tetra Tech were commissioned to assess and remediate the rock fall hazard. To mitigate the hazard in such a spatially constrained site, with critical infrastructure both at the base and on the slope, required a departure from the traditional scaling and remediation approach. Instead, a staged construction and hazard mitigation schedule was adopted, requiring a number of innovative techniques and solutions. The resulting design included the installation of a passive mesh system around very unstable masses of poor quality rock, prior to the construction of a catch fence, and use of a construction chute for scaling of rock immediately above the powerhouse. This paper details some of the unique challenges and solutions adopted on this site, allowing for successful construction completion within three months of initial assessment.
1. INTRODUCTION
Mayo ‘A’ Powerhouse is part of the ‘Mayo Hydro Facilities’ located approximately 5 km north of the town of Mayo, Yukon, Canada. The facility is owned and operated by Yukon Energy Corporation (YEC), and provides reliable cost effective energy to customers throughout the Yukon.
The facility provides power to the YEC grid, which connects a number of hydro facilities around the Yukon, and provides power directly to the town of Mayo.
The original powerhouse, commissioned in 1951, remains, and was constructed adjacent to a 70 m high heterogeneous rock and soil slope with minimal catchment between the slope and the powerhouse building.
During the spring of 2016, a series of rock fall events occurred, resulting in a number of near misses, and actual impacts to the roof and sidewall of the powerhouse. The damage caused, and the resulting repair work led to minor disruption to the plants operation, and highlighted the inadequacy of existing rock fall hazard mitigation measures existing up slope of the powerhouse.|","Document Type

After a refracturing candidate is identified based on a certain criteria, it is important to evaluate whether the planned fractures at the selected locations can propagate in the desired direction. Hydraulic fractures generally propagate in the direction of maximum horizontal stress (relatively larger horizontal compression stress). Therefore the feasibility of refracturing can be evaluated based on the time-varying stress state or stress reorientation of the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses due to pre-existing fractures and subsequent production. To capture this stress change process, a numerical model with detailed formation layers based on poroelasticity is developed. The model includes some pre-existing sharp-tip fractures and the fracture geometries were estimated using a separate hydraulic fracture simulator. Also the fracture surfaces are defined as contact pairs and allowed to contact or separate depending on the deformation continuity in the formation. Several load steps are used in the model, which can subsequently calculate the in-situ stresses and overpressure in pay zone, stress state change due to pre-existing and new fractures’ openings, and the most concerned ones during fracture production process. The numerical model can capture the whole picture of stress reorientation process due to hydraulic fracture treatment and reservoir production. Based on the stress change due to fracture opening and production rate, the right refracturing time window can be evaluated for planning new fractures at the desired locations. Numerical sensitivity study to key parameters was conducted to understand their impacts on refracturing time window.
1. INTRODUCTION
During the past few decades, technology development of multistage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has significantly increased the reservoir contact for economic production of unconventional reservoirs. Recent advances in hydraulic fracturing with slickwater fluid have resulted in economic production from shale gas reservoirs. Effective fracturing can make low permeability shale gas reservoir economic because of a large volume of rock being stimulated. Most horizontal shale gas wells will produce at a fraction of their initial rate after a certain production time, yet large volumes of hydrocarbon remain in the rock that could be produced through necessary and timely refracturing. The potential of refracturing shale gas reservoirs to boost production has been well understood recently [1-4].|","Document Type

Herein, we develop an empirical relation between mode-I fracture toughness and tensile strength according to data from laboratory tests and previous researches on several kinds of brittle rocks. The tensile strengths were determined from Brazilian disc (BD) specimens, and the mode-I fracture toughness data were determined from cracked chevron-notched Brazilian disc (CCNBD) specimens, as suggested by the International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM). In contrast to the previously published linear and exponential relations, our empirical relation exhibits dimensional unity between the two sides of the empirical formula, which is preferable in terms of both physical meaning and mathematical form. Furthermore, the previously published linear relations are only applicable in special cases premised on a uniform specimen radius. Using our proposed empirical relation, the mode-I fracture toughness of brittle rocks can be quickly estimated from the known tensile strength.
1. INTRODUCTION
Mode-I fracture toughness is increasingly recognized as critical to rock engineering applications. This parameter has informed project designs in hydraulic fracturing, rock slope construction and modification, underground tunneling and construction, and others. Rock engineering cases in which mode-I fracture toughness (KIC) data are not available require estimates of mode-I fracture toughness based on the tensile strength parameter.
Previous studies indicate that mode-I fracture toughness and tensile strength are two related parameters in rock materials, both denoting the rock’s resistance to tensile fracture (Litwin et al., 2012). It is therefore likely that mode-I fracture toughness can be estimated from tensile strength once the empirical relation between the two parameters is known (Zhang, 2002). In general, the rock’s tensile strength is more easily measured than its mode-I fracture toughness, both in the laboratory and at the site of an engineering project, and there are cases in which the mode-I fracture toughness cannot be determined other than by the estimation based on tensile strength.|","Document Type

Its mechanism has not been fully understood. Acoustic emission monitoring and moment tensor inversion technique cast a light in investigating the accumulation of micro-meso-scale fracture (damage) before the macro-fracture-propagation-stage of fracture coalescence. To this end, reliable sensor calibration is highly warranted to ensure the AE information is readily usable in moment tensor analysis. This paper presents and compares the calibration attempts by three types of sources, namely, breaking pencil lead source, ball drop source, and the source generated by the electrically energized piezoelectric sensor. By comparing these three source types for calibration, their advantages and disadvantages are identified. The ball drop source is the most suitable source among these three types of sources for the calibration in small scale prismatic rock blocks containing preexisting flaws for fracture coalescence tests. The polarity of the pencil lead source is its major disadvantage. The source generated by piezoelectric sensor has the highest repeatability among the three. However the aperture of the sensor and the strict requirement on the over-determined condition of the calibration equation system are the major problems in using it.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fracture coalescence processes have been extensively studied in rocks and rock-like materials, e.g. Einstein and Hirschfeld (1973), Shen et al. (1995), Bobet and Einstein (1998), Wong and Einstein (2009a) over the past 40 years. In these studies, the influences of flaw inclination angle, bridging angle, ligament length, and loading conditions (uniaxial, biaxial; monotonic, cyclic loading) on coalescence behavior were systematically investigated (Wong and Einstein 2009a).
In recent years, researches focusing on the observation of micro-fracturing contributed further knowledge to fracture coalescence behavior. Wong and Einstein (2009b) used the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to analyze the micro-fractures in fracture coalescence test. In their research, they observed the formation of an array of micro-fractures parallel to the loading direction. These micro-fractures are located along the path of the subsequently formed macro-scale shearing fracture. Cheng et. al. (2015) conducted research on specimens containing pre-existing parallel en-echelon fractures. In the tests, they observed the fracture coalescence between neighboring flaws of an en-echelon flaw series using fluorescent dying method. Again in their observation, micro-fractures whose arrangements are similar to that reported by Wong and Einstein (2009b) were formed at a time before the appearance of macro-fracture.|","Document Type

Permeability enhancement via shear slip is commonly accepted as the main stimulation mechanism. On the surface, this appears to exclude the propagation in tensile and shear mode of the natural fractures that experience slip. The misconception, has led to some even claim the discovery of a new stimulation mechanism via the formation of wing cracks. But, wing cracks are an integral part of the shear slip stimulation mechanism because shear slip increases the stress-intensity at the fracture tips, potentially leading to fracture propagation. This is particularly the case when natural fractures are subjected to direct fluid injection. On the other hand, natural fractures subjected to pore pressure through diffusion in the rock matrix could respond differently during stimulation. In an effort to better understand the impact of pore pressure and poroelastic stresses on the stimulation of naturally fractured reservoirs, a poroelastic displacement discontinuity model is developed and used in this study to illustrate various stimulation mechanisms. Mohr-Coulomb contact elements are used to represent pre-existing natural fractures. Our results indicate that natural fracture propagation is less likely to occur when water is injected in the rock matrix outside the natural fractures. Moreover, the orientation of natural fractures with respect to the wellbore is found to significantly impact their response. We also observe local destabilization and non-uniform distribution of shear deformation which is usually neglected or greatly simplified in other models.
1. INTRODUCTION
Unconventional resources are produced by reservoir stimulation by water injection. The pore pressure change due to injection/production can trigger shearing on critically-stressed natural fractures. Permeability enhancement through shear slip is a commonly accepted stimulation mechanism (Pine and Batchelor, 1984; Murphy et al. 1999). At times, this has been misunderstood to exclude the possibility of slip induced fracture propagation leading to the suggestion that a new and different stimulation mechanism is operating. In fact, some have even claimed the discovery of a new stimulation mechanism via the formation of wing cracks (McClure and Horne, 2013). But, the formation of wing cracks is an integral part of shear slip stimulation mechanism when fracture shear slip increases the stress-intensity at the fracture tips which can cause fracture propagation. It was this understanding that motivated the development of mixed mode fracture propagation models for geothermal reservoir development (Huang et al., 2013; Min et al., 2010). This is particularly the case when natural fractures are directly subjected to fluid injection at pressure below the minimum in-situ stress. Several studies have addressed the possibility of natural fracture propagation and coalescence as a stimulation mechanism (Min et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2013; Jung, 2013; Kamali and Ghassemi, 2016a; Kamali and Ghassemi, 2016b). Jung treated the subject analytically and provided field evidence for wing crack formation but did not consider the possibility of propagation in the “shear” mode. The wing crack is a well-established concept (Hoek and Bieniawksi, 1984; Horri and Nemat-Nasser, 1986; Shen and Stephansson, 1994; Rao et al., 2003), describing the extension in tension or shear mode of mechanically-closed cracks under applied compressive stresses. Kamali and Ghassemi (2016) have explicitly simulated the phenomenon during injection and have shown shear slip occurs at injection pressures below the minimum in-situ stress and triggers the out-ofplane wing cracks (Min et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2013; Kamali and Ghassemi, 2016a). Further propagation and coalescence might be achieved by maintaining the injection at pressures slightly higher than the minimum in-situ stress.|","Document Type

Hence, prediction of minimum required rock mass grouting pressure to overcome these two consequences is crucial. The paper describes an application of Newton’s second law along with the principles of fracture mechanics to predict the minimal rock mass grouting pressure for Khairabad earth dam rock foundation in Iran. The results of quality control of post grouting based on drilling of the grouted rock mass at the dam foundation revealed that, further grouting information is required to verify the applicability and credibility of the proposed method.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock mass grouting is used to fill the joints, voids, cavities of porous and discontinuous media to provide improved continuity and strength properties. The resulting continuous rock mass exhibits significantly reduced deformability and hydraulic conductivity yet revealing increased strength properties and load baring capacity.
An evaluation of rock mass grouting by proper interpretation of the grouting procedure and grouting performance requires a reliable design-construction criterion by which one can consider the extent of grout penetration and the time to be stopped. To achieve these, a predictive mathematical tool is required. Hence, the paper presents an analytical method to predict the minimal required rock mass grouting pressure.
2. A NEW PROPOSED METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF MINIMAL ROCK MASS GROUTING PRESSURE
In the course of rock mass grouting, there are two major sources of forces which act upon grout particles; the clockwise force that is exerted by the grout pump source, and the force that initiated due to joint’s walls or surfaces friction which acts upon grout particles counter clockwise. The later force may halt the grout movement, if it exceeds the pumping force. In other words, the grout particles motions or their stops are merely dependent upon the resultant or the net force of these two sources.|","Document Type

The samples tested were retrieved from three one-foot-long preserved core sections spanning a depth range of about 20 meters. For each depth, three types of mechanical tests were performed: brazilian tensile test, unconfined compression test (UCS) and confined compression test with ultrasonic wave velocity monitoring along and perpendicular to the plug axis. The mechanical data are augmented with X-ray CT image volumes acquired pre-test and post-test in order to elucidate some of the observations as well as to outline possible elements of a laboratory workflow that would comprise image-based heterogeneity assessment and prediction. We emphasize in particular the fact that if such workflow is to be standardized, care should be taken in acquiring properly calibrated plug scale X-ray images in order to allow heterogeneity quantification and its use as an input into future predictive models.
1. INTRODUCTION
Geomechanical testing of rock samples in the laboratory is typically limited in that every measurement accounts for the sample behavior as a whole with seldom acknowledgement of its internal degree of preexisting or induced heterogeneity. Preexisting heterogeneities such as mechanically weak layers in strongly laminated rocks may cause early failure. This effect, which causes a rock to behave in a strongly anisotropic fashion since the weaker surfaces need to be presented at an appropriate angle to the maximum stress to fail, is exemplified with the data of Figure 1 borrowed from Paterson and Wong [1]. In order for such an effect to be predicted, weak layers need to be identified, which involves imaging since no bulk measurement such as porosity, density or composition is able to capture that information. On the other hand, induced heterogeneity such as localized shear bands formed during brittle failure is known to strongly impact fluid flow, and cannot be accurately predicted in terms of e.g. number, thickness and orientation. Nondestructive 3D imaging greatly complements laboratory measurements by providing access to the internal make-up of a rock at various stages of a test. Moreover, it does seem sensible to expect that a core plug will often exhibit some degree of heterogeneity, as plug dimensions are not determined based on an assessment of the representative elementary volume (REV) for the material of interest.|","Document Type

D., University of the Witwatersrand| Zvarivadza, T., University of the Witwatersrand","|ABSTRACT: Slope stability and maximum productivity are critical to the success of any open pit mine. To achieve a profitable balance of the two, the slope has to be steep enough to minimize waste stripping and gentle enough to ensure slope stability. One means to this end is careful interpretation of slope monitoring data. This paper presents a real life case study of a platinum open pit mine which had been plagued with slope stability challenges and how slope monitoring data interpretation techniques were used to restore and enhance stability. Through monitoring data analysis the investigation identified that the hangingwall of the North Pit of the mine showed progressive movement with maximum movement found to be 8.5 mm/day. This proved a hypothesis that there is a crack existing behind the slopes. Routine inspections of the mine were done with the purpose to identify geological structures, hazardous conditions and review the quality of the highwall. The conditions of the footwalls were found to be fairly good and it is recommended that the same mining technique carried out when blasting trim benches in the footwall need to be carried out in hangingwall. The implementation of new technology in slope monitoring manages to solve slope failure challenges, however there is also need to optimise costs such that the most effective less costly technologies are implemented. In this light, this study highlights the practical applicability of different slope monitoring technologies including GroundProbe Slope Stability Radar, IBIS radar systems and GeoMos.
1. INTRODUCTION
Slope monitoring data is an asset an established open pit can utilize to gain insights into the stability of mine slopes. Much value can be driven from the data when it is accurately interpreted. Well considered slope monitoring data interpretation is the bases for sound slope management as noted by several researchers (Afeni and Cawood (2013), Hearn (2011), Read and Stacey (2009), Hutchinson et al (2007), Leonardos (2004), Hustrulid et al (2000) among others). Safety and maximum productivity are key goals for any mining operation. In open pit mining, the slope has to be steep enough to allow maximum productivity and gentle enough to allow safe mining.
The overall slope angle of a pit has direct influence on the cost of a mine, the steeper the pit angle the cheaper to mine, but also means higher probability of failure (Little, 2006). The slope angle has to be designed in such a way that it is safe and economic to mine. Well considered slope monitoring data interpretation becomes pivotal in achieving such a balance. Slope monitoring during mining gives better understanding of rock behaviour and alerts mining personnel of impending failures. This study is based on an investigation done at an open pit platinum mine and practically illustrates how enhanced slope stability can be achieved through careful slope monitoring data interpretation.|","slope failure,  safety, slope stability,  productivity,  risk,  monitoring methods"

During the development of the Vaca Muerta Shale, and due to the complex nature of the geology and geomechanical conditions of the play, well interference has been observed while pumping a vertical well. Microseismic events recorded during stimulation show a map-view “Z” pattern that has not been observed before and potentially identifies a trend of preexisting natural fractures/faults striking NE-SW and NW-SW, and steeply dipping that could hydraulically connect adjacent wells. We used a 3D coupled flow and geomechanical simulator to evaluate the geometric characteristics and material and fault properties that could produce well interference using the field parameters utilized during the stimulation operations in the study pad, and that would produce comparable synthetic microseismicity. Simulation results show that fluid pressure can communicate through sufficiently conductive faults for relatively long distances between 300 m and 700 m. In the case investigated here, hydraulic fractures can be arrested by faults and reinitiate from its tip. Fracture height growth exceeds the estimated propped height, consistent with the distribution of microseismicity. Results also indicate that the microseismic event cloud distribution follows large-scale structures, and therefore the presence of conductive faults could explain the well interference problems observed in the field.
1. INTRODUCTION
The vast majority of the oil-and-gas-bearing reservoirs in the world contain rock discontinuities such as faults and fractures (Bratton et al., 2005) that affect how fluid is distributed in the reservoir. The properties of the faults and the rock surrounding them, such as fault gouge, fluid pressure, fluid types, lateral sedimentary facies variations, reservoir architecture, and stresses, dictate whether faults act as barriers or transmitters of fluid flow (Barr, 2007).|","Document Type

The importance of these records for construction support evaluation, as a record which might be used in litigation, or as a factual record for long term maintenance are factors that necessitate high quality, consistent mapping. The challenge is taking differing mapping geologists and engineers of varying experience, and ensuring they map geology and evaluate geotechnical parameters accurately and consistently. This can be especially difficult in poor ground which is regularly shotcreted, or for example, ensuring standards are kept to cover the course of a three year project where staff changes are inevitable. The paper presents procedures and methodologies which can achieve the aims described above as part of a Quality Management Plan. In essence the aim of the paper is to form a practical guide to tunnel mapping with tailored Quality Control and Assurance procedures. The paper is based on the authors working on numerous tunnelling and mining projects in South East Asia, Europe and North America where both drill & blast and Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM’s) were used.

The recording of geological information to recognized standards has become an increasingly important function of engineering geologists or geotechnical engineers working on tunneling projects. Frequently the use of this data is of vital importance not only to assess ground conditions and thence support requirements, but as a relied upon record of the geological and geotechnical conditions found on a project. The use of the records are often for comparisons to the envisaged geology contained within a baseline report, or alternatively, used for maintenance purposes and assessment of potential issues in the longer term life of the tunnel.

Keevil Institute of Mining Engineering","|ABSTRACT: Grouting rock mass requirements typically involve having an extensive understanding on the location of fractures, their apertures, persistence and transmissivity. Traditional core logging, although useful at providing accurate information, often leads to low confidence in the spatial distribution of the discontinuities or errors in the structural data gathered. Televiewers are becoming essential to record structural data for use in engineering projects. Combining manual core orientation techniques with televiewer data allows for an excellent understanding of lithological units, orientation, and thicknesses of the structures. This paper covers the use of traditional core logging in combination with acoustic and optical televiewer methods and hydraulic data from packer testing to target specific fractures and zones where grouting may be required. Advantages and disadvantages of using both methods when undertaking grouting programs are presented and correlated with a theoretical case study.
1. INTRODUCTION
Historically grouting of hard rock has followed empirical techniques and has relied on the use of geotechnical data estimated from traditional core logging and water tests to target areas where grouting is recommended. Routinely, grouting programs are undertaken following an empirical procedure, where water tests are carried out every 10 ft. (~3 m) along a borehole without understanding the exact location of fractures, and their conditions (aperture, fillings, etc.) which in many cases does not fulfill a thorough assessment regarding the groutability and location of zones requiring grouting. Moreover, traditional core logging, which in many cases is used to help grouting programs; in many occasions does not reveal all data and underestimates the main “in-situ” characteristics necessary to carry out a grouting program in a timely and cost efficient manner, i.e. one of the big challenges of traditional core logging is the estimate of joint apertures (due to drilling disturbance) and infill (due to drilling flush/fluids).
Not considering “in-situ” conditions on the rock surfaces to determine apertures might lead to misconceptions on whether stresses are increasing these areas of contact, tending to reduce the flow uniformity, or if in reality the aperture found through matedness correspond to the real aperture of the fracture. Therefore, describing and classifying apertures by means of solely traditional core logging is a challenging process. If the joint matedness is high, the aperture variations over the surface will be small. The matedness of a joint is essentially the degree to which the two surfaces of the joint can be fixed together without any voids between the upper and lower joint surface (Spross, 2016).|","Document Type

A thick (20 to 40 m) weak, sheared soil-like coal seam will be exposed near the base of the proposed highwall slope. A wall-scale slope instability occurred previously at a nearby pit; whether a similar weak seam contributed to the previous instability is being investigated. As part of this investigation, the geomechanical properties of the seam and its anticipated behavior during mining activities are crucial to the assessment of highwall stability. Published information about the elastic properties of this seam is scarce. Initial strength testing of the seam was carried out at a rock testing laboratory with limited success. Subsequent testing at a soils laboratory was more successful. This paper presents the tests conducted at the soils laboratory. The estimated strength and stiffness properties are presented. The results from the testing are compared with typical coal properties in the region. The results contribute to a robust database compiled for the region, which is deficient in testing of this weak sheared coal seam.
1.0 INTRODUCTION
A coal mine in southeastern British Columbia (BC), Canada is planning an open pit, which will include a highwall up to 400 m in height. The highwall will expose a series of coal seams within a sequence of interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone. A geotechnical study is underway to develop appropriate pit slope design criteria for the proposed highwall. The final highwall design will have an impact on site safety, project economics, and risk management.
During a geotechnical investigation, it was discovered that the location of the proposed highwall may exhibit more structural, geological, and hydrogeological complexity than other pit areas. This includes a thickening of a coal seam (herein referred to as the weak sheared coal seam) near the toe of the proposed slope due to shearing along thrust faults. A corresponding reduction in strength of the seam is observed in response to this shearing. Thrust repetition has thickened the weak coal to between 20 and 40 m. The ability of such a thick sequence of soil-like material to support up to 400 m of highwall slope is therefore being evaluated.|","Document Type

As part of this work, two 0.5 kilometer intervals of the highway were re-aligned and widened (from two to four lanes), by pushing back two steep bluffs on the upslope side of the existing highway using side hill cuts into rock. Even though the rock consists of very competent granitic rock, during the project inception it became evident that steepening the rock bluffs to push back the highway alignment was going to be challenging, and if not designed and constructed appropriately the newly formed rock slopes could be susceptible to mass movements. Also, during the design stages, it was identified that kinematically stable slope angles were too flat, and that it was not practical to adopt such angles. Therefore, steeper slope angles than kinematically stable slope angles were designed and constructed, but this required ongoing assessment and stabilization of the newly excavated rock cuts as these got exposed.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Trans-Canada Highway 1 (TCH) is the primary east-west connection through British Columbia, Canada. It is the main gateway to the rest of Canada, and a vital route for travel, tourism and trade.
Despite a lot of work to improve the TCH highway 1 in recent years, it consists mostly of a two-lane highway, and there are still many sections with sharp curves, steep grades and narrow bridges.
The BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) is in the process of upgrading the TCH in British Columbia, Canada, between Kamloops, BC and the Alberta border. Upgrades have been conducted in a series of separate projects, to complete a modern, 100 km/h, four-lane highway, which will allow traffic to move more safely and efficiently. Upgrades will allow communities to be better connected, and businesses will be better able to move their products throughout the province.|","Document Type

The time dependent rockmass rupture and deformation was also observed on the roof arch when the excavation was stopped for about 13 months. In this paper, we systematically analyze the problems of high stress failure, bulking deformation, large deformation caused by faults and time effect of subcritical crack propagation in the construction of Baihetan underground powerhouse caverns.
l. INTRODUCTION
The Baihetan hydropower station located on the Jinsha River (a tributary of the Yangtze River), in the Southwest of China. It’s the second largest hydroelectric project in term of generation capacity in China, next to Three Gorges project. The underground powerhouse carven group of Baihetan project is under construction, and it’s the largest underground carven group in China: the three main caverns (main powerhouse cavern, main transformer cavern, tailrace surge chamber) of Baihetan in the left and right bank are parallel in layout. The main main powerhouse caverns are 438m <U+00D7> 31m <U+00D7>88.7m (length <U+00D7> width <U+00D7> height). The buried depth of the left bank underground powerhouse cavern is about 270~300 m, the right bank is about 420 ~ 500m, and the measured maximum stress is about 31MPa. The rockmass of caverns are mainly basalt, uniaxial compressive strength 80~120 MPa, and the brittle characteristics is significant. The stability of the surrounding rockmass of the underground caverns is also controlled by the large gentle dip faults, such as C2 and C4. During the excavation of the caverns, the spalling and high stress failure were observed in the top arch and side wall. The depth of excavation damage zone is 1~3m and the local position is about 4m. Time depended deformation due to subcritical crack propagation on the roof of main powerhouse cavern was observed during the excavation of lay III.|","Document Type

K., CSIR-Central Institute of Mine & Fuel Research","|ABSTRACT: Fully grouted rock bolts are considered the most economical support system for exposed unsupported rock in various mining operations. The paper presents parametric study of an underground metal mine with the horizontal cut-and-fill method of mining at the depth of 150 meters from the surface through numerical simulation using Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC3D). Four different height of extraction i.e. 3m, 5m, 6m & 7m has been excavated numerically to evaluate the induced stress value and its parametric variation with the different height of extraction. Factor of safety was calculated numerically for estimating the stability of different stope height. The performance of the bolts were studied by conducting series of in-situ pullout tests, and parametric analysis of stress along the length of the bolt at different extraction/stope height. The load-deformation curve of bolts indicates the de-bonding nature of bolt with axial deformation of 42-46 mm. From the parametric study, it can be apprehended that with lode width of 8m and average height of extraction/stope (5m) the underground working does not experienced any pronounced ground control problems. At extraction height more than 5m the induced stress values are more and the chances of roof fall and failure of rock bolts are higher.
1. INTRODUCTION
Strata control is a major problem affecting safety, productivity and mechanization in underground coal and metal mines. With the advent of modern techniques associated with increased mechanization, roof bolting has gained prominence as a primary means of support in place of traditional supports, a hindrance for achieving higher production rate and productivity apart from economic and socio-ecological considerations. Rock bolts and dowels have been used for many years for the support of underground excavations and a wide variety of bolt and dowel types have been developed to meet different needs which arise in mining and civil engineering. The principle component of reinforcement system is the rock, reinforcing bar, internal fixture and external fixture (a plate and a nut) (Windsor and Thompson, 1993). They are generally tensioned after installation so as to make them an active support. When bolts are not tensioned or tensioning is not possible then they act like a passive support and are generally called dowels. Rock support is the term widely used to describe the procedures and materials used to improve the stability and maintain the load bearing capacity of rock near to the boundaries of an underground excavation. Thus, rock bolts not only support the weight of the unstable rock mass but also mobilize and enhance the inherent strength in the rock mass so as to control the movement of strata surrounding an opening in such a way that the availability of the opening to perform its desired function is not impaired. The support and stability of any underground mining excavation operation are of great concern for the engineer as any failure of strata would lead to severe concerns and loss of life of men working in certain cases. In order to stabilize any structure or strata, the condition associated has to be understood with a scientific approach. There are plenty number of techniques developed over the years to support and stabilize the structure, of which rock reinforcement by bolting is a very common technique either mechanical, grouted, or anchored, and is considered to be one of the important support member, being used all over the world for more than a century. The usage of rock bolts worldwide increased extensively over the decades and was in excess of 500,000,000 annually (Winsdor, 1997). A rock bolt support system assembly consists of a ribbed bar inserted in a drilled hole into the rock or roof of mine and anchored to it by means of mechanical or grouting material. Such system is very efficient in applications such as stabilization of blocky rock masses, rock confinement and improvement of the mechanical properties of the rock (Chappell, 1989). Easy and quick installation procedure and also the low cost as compared to other reinforcement systems are also responsible for its huge success (Stillborg, 1986). The main function of roof bolting is to bind together roof rocks consisting of natural joints and fractures, or rocks with artificial fractures and cracks caused by the use of explosives (Peng and Tang, 1984). Experience throughout the world by many researchers, to understand the mechanism of bolting assembly, behavior and assessment of grouted bolts performance have shown that de-bonding during the axial loading of rock bolt takes place either at the bolt-grout interface or at the grout-rock interface, depending on which one is weaker (Farmer, 1975; Freeman, 1978; Indraratna and Kaiser, 1990; Benmokrane et al., 1995; Fuller et al., 1996; Li and Stillborg, 1999; Cai et al., 2004; Hagan, 2004; Moosavi et al., 2005; Carranza-Torres, 2009; Ivanovic and Neilson, 2009; Bobet and Einstein, 2011; Li, 2014; Lin et al., 2014). With the movement of the rock mass, a load is transferred to the bolt which consequently results in the development of shear stress along the grouted length (Figure 1). The figure shows the stress developed in the small part of the bolt length dz when the force acts axially.|","Document Type

N., University of the Witwatersrand| Zvarivadza, T., University of the Witwatersrand","|ABSTRACT: In a typical conventional narrow reef mining, the support of mining excavations and geological disturbances is of vital importance to the whole mining operation. The consequences of unplanned stope collapse and compromised safety practices encompass uneconomical extraction of orebodies and lost productivity. Comprehensive stope support design is mandatory for safe working conditions in a mine. This study reviews the stope support design of a narrow reef platinum mine in the Bushveld Complex, and investigates impact of support deficiencies in under planned and over planned stopes. Comparable mining areas based on panel audits were reviewed, focusing on the areas experiencing stability challenges. In addition, an analysis of the rockfalls database was investigated to derive the root cause of rockfalls within stopes. This was done by evaluating the fallout thickness. A similar method of calculation of the fallout thickness was undertaken to identify any deficiencies within the stope support practices. The study identified several underlying rock engineering problems faced by the mine and offers possible feasible solutions. The research notes that improved support strategies when dealing with bad ground conditions in the stopes enhance support efficiency. Reinforced support crew training is also beneficial in implementing the improved support strategies.
1. INTRODUCTION
There are several stope support systems designs in current use within South African tabular ore bodies. These systems are a variation of support dimensions and layouts, that are optimized based on the present geological and geotechnical conditions in the mining environments. This research reviews the stope support design, performance, support standards and installation practices of a Bushveld Complex mine. The mine depth extends to 270m below surface and mines the Upper Group 2 (UG2) reef that dips between 10° and 15 °. The geology of the mining area can be represented by the pinching out of the lower Bushveld stratigraphy against a floor-rock edge. This causes the UG2 layer to be located much closer to the floor-rocks than in other areas in the BIC. The mine is hosted by rock mass of the Upper Critical zone in the BIC stratigraphic column, which is known as one of the world’s largest platinum bearing layer. As a consequence of the depth of mining, the most common example of geological features are flat dipping curved joints, potholes areas, dome areas, shallow areas and shear zone areas. The mining area has an estimated resources of 3 Platinum Group Elements (palladium, platinum, and rhodium) and gold.|","fall of ground, stope support design,  stability,  safety,  FOG"

However, there is a lack of understanding at the micrometer scale. Thus we introduce a new method to predict micro scale rock mechanical properties based on microCT imaging, combined with nanoindentation testing and discrete element method (DEM) modelling. Essentially microCT scanning and nanoindentation testing provide the morphology and mechanical property inputs for the DEM simulation. As an example the CO2-swelling effect of a highly heterogeneous coal sample is presented, and we were able to correctly predict the internal stresses, and the failure mechanisms of the unswelling (mineral) phase, consistent with lab experiments. We thus conclude that the proposed method can accurately and efficiently predict the rock mechanical performance at microscale.
1. INTRODUCTION
Laboratory rock mechanical testing has been widely used on standard core samples to examine rock mechanical performance under different axial and confining pressures, typically at centimeter to meter scale. However, the micro-scale rock mechanical performance is very important; e.g. in hydraulic fracturing of coal or shale, where small changes in effective stress can significantly affect the micro fractures’ morphology, which can result in dramatic changes in permeability. It is thus of key importance to predict the micro-scale rock mechanical performance. One way to achieve this is by combining x-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging (e.g. Iglauer et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2016a, b, c, e; Jing et al., 2016) - where the microstructure inside the rock can be imaged in 3D at high resolution - with nanoindentation testing, where the mechanical properties of the material can be obtained at micro/nanoscale (Zhu et al., 2009; Bobko et al., 2011; Lebedev et al., 2014; Vialle and Lebedev, 2015; Zhang et al., 2017) and discrete element (DEM) simulations - which can predict the mechanical behaviour of the rock.|","Document Type

P., Northwestern University","|ABSTRACT: Presented is a new spherocylindrical microplane constitutive model that can capture the inelastic fracturing behavior of orthotropic materials, and particularly the shale. The basic idea is to couple a cylindrical microplane system to the classical spherical microplane system. Each system is subjected to the same strain tensor while their stress tensors are superposed. The spherical phase is similar to the previous microplane models for concrete and isotropic rock. The cylindrical phase, which is what creates the transverse isotropy, involves only microplanes that are normal to plane of isotropy, or the bedding layers, and enhance the stiffness and strength in that plane. This new model can reproduce all the five independent elastic constants of transversely isotropic shales, which are all positive if the elastic in-to-out-of plane moduli ratio is < 3.75 (this applies to all shales). Vice versa, from these constants, one can easily calculate all the microplane elastic moduli. Oriented micro-crack openings, frictional micro-slips and bedding plane behavior can be modelled more intuitively than with the spectral approach. Data fitting shows that the microplane resistance depends on the angle with the bedding layers non-monotonically, reaching a minimum at 30° to 60°. Finally, comparisons with extensive test data for shale validate the model.
1. INTRODUCTION
Despite the astonishing recent success of hydraulic fracturing technology, aka fracking [1], the mechanics of shale fracturing is still poorly understood and major gaps of knowledge remain [2]. This may explain why only 5% to 15% of the gas contained in the shale strata is currently getting extracted. Increasing this percentage requires tackling a number of problems. One of them is the problem of material constitutive model for fracturing damage and frictional slip in shale.
Mainly because of the pronounced anisotropy of shale, no realistic constitutive model exists at present. It is needed to design and control the fracking for gas or oil, as well as deep underground sequestration of C02, fracking water and other toxic fluids, and for radioactive waste disposal. No less it is needed for safety assessments of tunnels and underground caverns, tall building or bridge foundations, and all kinds of geotechnical excavations in shale.|","Document Type

To mitigate the high nonlinearity in both the EOS of the water substance and the behavior of a fracture-matrix system, our formulations are simplified from actual system behavior but preserves the most fundamental behaviors of the steam-water fracture-matrix system. As a preliminary example of application, we used the model to study the effects of rock permeability on the development of the heated zone around the injection point. The results show how the steam chamber dimensions and injection temperature depend on rock permeability.
1. INTRODUCTION
Cyclic steam stimulation is an important enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method. A significant portion of California’s oil production, especially that in the San Joaquin Valley, relies on this technique. This technique has proven to be very effective to produce heavy oil contained in the shallow yet thick diatomite formations in the San Joaquin Valley (Kumar and Beatty, 1995; Murer et al., 1997; Fong et al., 2001). Otherwise, the oil is too viscous to be produced economically from diatomite formations that have relatively low permeability. Cyclic steaming entails injecting high temperature, high pressure water-steam mixture for a period of time (days to weeks), followed by a soaking period of zero to several days, and production from the same well with or without artificial lifting.
The modeling and analysis of cyclic steaming has conventionally considered it to be a multi-phase (gas and liquid), single- or multi-component (oil, water, etc.) flow process in a porous medium (Blanco-Martin et al, 2016). However, there exists strong evidence suggesting that hydraulic fracturing is triggered or induced in the injection phase (Kumar and Beatty, 1995; Kovscek et al, 1997). The injection is often performed at pressure greater than the fracturing pressure (i.e. bottomhole pressure greater than the minimum principal in situ stress at the depth) (Speight, 2009). In California’s South Belridge, Lost Hills, and Cymric Fields, surface tiltmeter mapping has revealed that high rate steam injection generates fractures along the least principal stress plane whereas low rate steam injection seems to trigger two sets of fractures oblique to that plane (Weijers et al., 1999). Our interpretation of this phenomenon, which is different from that in Weijers et al. (1999), is that low injection rate activates natural fractures whereas high injection rate causes fluid pressure that is sufficiently high to open new fractures against the minimum principal stress direction.|","Document Type

P., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory| Herbold, E. B., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory| Homel, M. A., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory| Annavarapu, C., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","|ABSTRACT: In traditional hydraulic fracturing stimulation, the effective conductivity of low permeability rock is increased by generating/activating fractures through injection of pressurized fluid. One possible extension of traditional hydraulic fracturing is to increase the loading rate that the driving fluid applies on the formation. Methods that use dynamic loading potentially extend stimulation to previously inaccessible geological resources. In contrast to pump-driven hydraulic fracturing methods, dynamic stimulation can generate stresses in the source region that may be significantly larger than the in-situ stress, which helps to create fractures that may grow in directions other than that of the minimum in-situ stress. Furthermore, the increased loading rate has potential to generate fractures in relatively ductile formations. With dynamic loading, fractures are initially generated by the diverging stress wave propagating from the energy release zone. It has been shown that the crack area and final extent depend on the ability of explosive products to flow into cracks after wave propagation. Here we investigate the potential for crack generation from stress waves, and the opening of those cracks via the flow of explosive product gases into the cracks by developing a coupled Finite Element (FE) and Godunov scheme for fluid-solid interactions.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing is a common method for stimulating wells in petroleum and geothermal reservoirs (Eaton, 1969; Simonson et al., 1978). Hydraulic fracture orientation is largely controlled by principal stress magnitudes and orientation due to the slow propagation of the stimulated fractures. Dynamic fracture stimulation methods based on the detonation/deflagration of energetic materials may provide an alternative stimulation technology for geothermal and petroleum-bearing formations (Reeves and Weida, 1995). With an increasing rate of injection, which is achievable with explosives or propellants, it is possible to create fractures at arbitrary orientations and potentially stimulate the near wellbore region more uniformly (Reeves and Weida, 1995). Such an approach relies on the ability of stress waves from an explosive charge to overcome the in-situ stresses and create fractures in various directions, in contrast to a single preferentially aligned fracture commonly formed during hydraulic fracturing. However, it is also well known that shock waves emanating from a detonation can compact the rock and reduce the permeability (Reeves and Weida, 1995).|","Document Type

This paper presents a new method for estimating rock bridges using a searching algorithm that identifies potential failure pathways through Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models which more realistically represent the spatial pattern of fracturing, with realistic fracture sizes, intensity variation, and orientation. The approach differentiates between rock bridges failing under shear and those failing under tension. Without the need for complex numerical simulations, the approach can analyse multiple slope sections to provide a probabilistic assessment of the rock bridge percentage and slope stability. The resulting step path “rock bridge percentage” can also be applied to conventional continuum approach as an anisotropic rock mass strength
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock mass strength for slope stability analysis is defined as a combination of the strength of fractures and also the intact rock and the strength of intact rock. Typically there are one or more well-developed fracture sets that provide preferential planes or orientations of weakness within the rock mass. If one of these sets is oriented adversely with respect to the slope, the analyses need to consider their impact on stability. These joint sets are commonly incorporated into the analyses as ubiquitous joints (or anisotropic strength orientations) that are assigned strength values based on the estimated shear strength of typical discontinuities. This approach may lead to overly conservative estimates of the factor of safety of the slope particularly when it is assumed that the structures are infinitely continuous.
Critical failure surfaces through the rock mass form partly along discontinuities and partly through the rock mass and it is the magnitude of this rock ‘bridging’ that often governs the stability of the slope yet has remained a hard to define property. This problem is illustrated in Figure 1. It is complicated by the fact that this is a composite failure mechanism involving both shear and tensile failure mechanism.|","Document Type

Understanding these interactions and embedding them into models is essential for predicting their effect and thus optimizing stimulation treatments. We present a finite elements (FE) model of hydraulic stimulation, focusing on the interaction HF-NF. The model is based on the full elasticity problem and established cohesive zone models, guaranteeing its abiding by fracture mechanics theory. The preexisting discontinuity is endowed with distinct interface properties, and the interaction is fully resolved within the FE simulation. The model is first validated with experimental data (Blanton, 1982). A parametric analysis is performed to elucidate the competition between crossing and reactivation regimes. Calculated and experimental results are in good agreement. The model is then used to carry out a parametric analysis of the interaction for the case of an Argentinean unconventional reservoir. A range of behaviors is predicted for this case.
1. INTRODUCTION
Unconventional tight reservoirs are characterized by their extremely low permeability. Quite often, these reservoirs have a complex network of natural fractures that, despite of potentially being hydraulically conductive, depending on their degree of cementation, need to be stimulated in order to provide a permeable path between them and the producing well.
A typical stimulation process includes water injection at high pressure, together with chemicals (friction reducers, jellifiers to increase the viscosity, etc.) and proppant. As the fluid is injected and the hydraulic fracture continues growing perpendicular to the minimum principal stress, it reaches the surrounding natural fractures and may connect them to the well. If this happens, the stimulated reservoir volume is enhanced.
Due to the complexity of the mechanical system and the challenging problem of modeling the hydraulic fracture’s propagation, the behavior of the hydraulic fracture (HF) as it approaches to a natural fracture (NF) is unclear and therefore has been focus of research for many years, including field (Warpinski and Teufel 1987), laboratory (Blanton, 1982, 1986; Bahorich et al., 2012, etc.), analytical (Renshaw and Pollard 1995; Gu et al., 2011) and numerical work (Dahi-Talegani and Olson, 2011, 2014).|","Document Type

With a pair of narrow and shallow groove cut at opposite ends of the loading diameter, GBD relieves the shortcoming of non-central crack initiation possibly inherent to the counterpart complete Brazilian disc (BD) subjected to diametrically compression during testing. Having the same merit pertaining to our previously-proposed flattened Brazilian disc (FBD), GBD can be used in the Brazilian test more effectively than BD. GBD can represent the original BD, FBD, and the cracked Brazilian disc as its special cases. More advantages may be obtained if the geometric parameters of GBD are suitably chosen by referring to the analytical formulas, derived by superposition of two models we proposed. The approximate formulas can be used to predict qualitatively evolution trend of the stress both at and near the front of the apex of the groove, and also the influencing geometric parameters of GBD. Quantitative numerical calculations and experimental results are also provided. In conclusion, a minor change in boundary condition of a Brazilian disc specimen under diametral compression, such as FBD and GBD, can influence the fracture process of the tested specimen, enhancing their effectiveness in the Brazilian test.

Further, international societies (e.g. ASTM(2008), ISRM (1978) adopted it by prescribing the Brazilian test as the standard method for measuring the tensile strength of concrete, rock, and other brittle or quasibrittle materials.

The FracVista workflow is based on the near offset Ruger equation and uses a proprietary geostatistical decomposition technique which aims at separate the noise from the anisotropic components and leads to a much more robust extraction of anisotropic parameters. The study was successful in extracting anisotropic parameters from the data. An azimuthal inversion estimated fracture properties assuming a single set of rotationally invariant vertical fractures (HTI).|","Document Type

K., Politecnico di Torino| Musso, G., Politecnico di Torino| Lancellotta, R., Politecnico di Torino| Brignoli, M., Eni S.p.A.| Mantica, S., Eni S.p.A.","|ABSTRACT: O&G companies, during normal activities of field development planning and execution, have to assess their projects in terms of environmental sustainability in addition to technical and economic feasibility. With such a primary aim, Eni’s commitment to both monitoring and modeling of subsidence has been very strong since the early nineties.
Most offshore development platforms have been equipped with GPS stations, able to continuously monitor horizontal and vertical displacements, and radar images are constantly acquired and interpreted for onshore fields. To complete the internal approach, a workflow based on elasto-plastic finite element modeling has been implemented in order to properly reproduce the measured data and to accurately predict the future evolution of the settlement phenomenon.
In some cases, it is beneficial to enrich classical elasto-plastic constitutive models to fully reproduce the time evolution of subsidence as recorded by continuously monitoring instruments such as GPSs. Actually, the extension of those models with the introduction of a viscosity component allows for a more detailed match of the recordings, with an increased reliability of the forecasted evolution scenarios.
In this paper, the elasto-visco-plastic law by Vermeer and Neher (VNM) is evaluated as a possible constitutive model for the simulation of subsidence occurring above gas and oil reservoirs. This elasto-visco-plastic model can be regarded as a natural extension of the modified Cam-Clay model (MCCM), usually employed by Eni for subsidence modeling. Furthermore, its parameters have a clear physical meaning and can be easily determined from laboratory tests. Oedometer and creep tests performed on sand samples from gas reservoirs are first introduced together with model predictions. Then, a synthetic, nevertheless realistic, case study is analyzed to assess the capabilities of this elasto-visco-plastic model in the simulation of subsidence. Elasto-plastic (MCCM) and elasto-visco-plastic (VNM) simulations are compared to outline the implications of the elasto-visco-plastic modelling in the simulation of subsidence evolution.|","Document Type

In order to better understand these events, the study of instability must encompass brittle material behavior and the capacity for sudden displacements in the overburden. This paper presents the results of a case study in which the 5.3 local magnitude seismic event associated with a documented mine collapse is correlated with the results of a numerical simulation through calculations of released kinetic energy. The approach includes a calibration of strain softening properties at the pillar scale to accommodate an unstable response and match deformations observed at the time of the collapse. Widespread pillar failure is then simulated in a mine scale model using a 2D finite difference software. Calculations of released energy are recorded throughout the simulation, and the results are compared to estimates of released energy associated with the seismic event through empirical relations. The analysis shows that the sudden reduction in average support pressure observed at the pillar scale accommodates a release of energy in the overburden of the mine scale model that correlates well with the documented seismic magnitude. The method of analysis illustrated in this study may be useful in future studies concerning the potential for unstable pillar failure.
1. INTRODUCTION
The sudden failure of underground room and pillar mine workings can endanger the lives of miners and halt production. Pillar design is routinely based on empirical methods and numerical analysis, but unforeseen geologic conditions may result in higher-than-anticipated loads or insufficient pillar strengths. This paper illustrates a back analysis of the collapse of the southwest panel of the Solvay Trona Mine, which occurred in February of 1995. An area of mine workings encompassing nearly two square kilometers collapsed in a matter of seconds and was accompanied by a 5.3 local magnitude seismic event (Swanson, 1995). The collapse resulted in the death of one miner and significant delays in production (Ferriter, 1996).|","Document Type

While these techniques are adequate for capturing bulk effects, they fail to capture fine detail related to the actual deformation of constituent mineral phases because the measurement captures the combined effect of pore network geometry change and polymineralic deformation. A more precise measurement of mineral deformation in fluid saturated porous media has the potential to improve understanding of poroelastic behavior and material failure where pore pressure is present.
Neutron diffraction has emerged as a unique and powerful technique for measuring the localized lattice strains of mineral phases inside of geological materials. The highly penetrating nature of neutrons also permits interrogation of the interior regions of geological samples even when they are contained in otherwise difficult to access or opaque structures such as pressure vessels. This paper summarizes a set of neutron diffraction experiments that were performed with geological materials of varying porosity and permeability using a custom-designed triaxial pressure cell. The results confirm that neutron diffraction has the potential to become a useful tool for quantifying the behavior of distinct crystalline phases within porous media.
1. INTRODUCTION
Poroelastic behavior in rock mechanics has been studied in great detail since the foundational works of Terzaghi and Biot (Biot, 1941). There have been a number of prior efforts focused on experimental measurement of poroelastic parameters, including comparative approaches (Lion et al, 2004). The classical Biot formulation of poroelastic constants used to represent bulk material response may also be represented as combinations of distinct elastic moduli related to material porosity, grain compressibility, and pore fluid compressibility (Gassman, 1951). This formulation is useful for calculating expected property variation for changes in pore, matrix or fluid composition. These component moduli can be individually measured in a straight-forward manner via traditional drained, undrained and unjacketed tests when isotropic assumptions are made. The measurements result in an overdetermined number of poroelastic parameters and so some work has attempted to develop procedures for fitting moduli to the obtain the traditional four poroelastic parameters for the isotropic material system (Hart and Wang 1995; Hart and Wang, 2001).|","Document Type

E., Shell International Exploration and Production Company| Gage, C., Shell International Exploration and Production Company| Martinez, R., Shell International Exploration and Production Company| Dudley, J. W., Shell International Exploration and Production Company","|ABSTRACT: Tracking the development of hydraulic fracture (HF) propagation in the laboratory and in the field has always been difficult, especially in cases where multiple HFs are propagating simultaneously. A new method is presented using fiber optic (FO) technology to monitor the hydraulic fracturing process during real time. The method has been proven using FO cables ‘woven’ in a grid pattern and cast inside 46 cm (18 inch) cubic blocks of cement. Some of these blocks were then placed in a large cubic polyaxial load frame and subjected to a true triaxial state of stress during the fracturing operation. The FO cable acts essentially as a long continuous ‘strain gage’ in the direction of the cable. As a HF propagates across each FO cable segment it sharply strains each one. This process allows a real time tracking of the position of the growing hydraulic fracture crack tip during testing. The technique is being used to track single HFs, multiple HFs, and leak- off haloes in polyaxial HF block testing.
1. INTRODUCTION
Most of the technologies employed in the laboratory to track the propagation of single fractures involve acoustic active techniques such as: (1) pulse transmission through the crack (Stanchits et al., 2012); (2) pulse-echo off the crack itself (Glaser and Hand, 1998); (3) diffraction off the crack tip (Glaser and Hand, 1998; de Pater et al., 2001); (4) shear wave shadowing (Dudley et al., 1995 and de Pater et al., 2001); and (5) velocity tomography (Scott and Abousleiman, 2005). Acoustic emission, a passive technology, also has been used to track the evolution of hydraulic fractures (HFs) (Scott et al., 2000).
Each of these techniques was considered when undertaking a laboratory rock mechanics research project to track the evolution of simultaneously propagating hydraulic fractures during polyaxial block testing. Preliminary attempts were made with acoustic emission and some of the ultrasonic pulse techniques. All the acoustic technologies were eventually rejected for use because they have the same inherent problem - if more than two fractures are propagating side by side then the outer fractures effectively ‘shield’ the inner fractures from being accurately detected. This is due to attenuation, wave splitting, and the complex diffraction patterns of waves created by passing through and reflecting off of multiple fractures.|","Document Type

This is also the underlying reason for the ductile to brittle failure mode transition when the structure size increases. An exponential displacement-softening model was introduced via contact bonds in the bonded discrete element representation of continuums. This facilitated the DEM modeling of micro-cracks ahead of crack tip, and thus capturing the fracture process zone. A regularization of softening parameters based on fracture energy and particle size was also introduced to reduce the impacts of particle size. Direct tension tests were carried out to investigate fracture process and size effect of mode-I fracture on similar single edge notched beams. A wide range of structure size was used, which was reflected in the depth of beams being used spanning from 1 mm to 2000 mm. These beams are constructed using 2D uniform circular particles packed in square arrangement. Results show that the present DEM model is capable of capturing the size effects, and the ductile to brittle failure mode transition was captured. The changes of the maximum nominal stresses with structural sizes were also well modeled by the general size effect law proposed by Bazant and Pfeiffer.
1. INTRODUCTION
The bonded-particle model (BPM) developed by Potyondy and Cundall (2004) makes it possible to model fracture in the discrete element method. A bond between a pair of particles breaks if the stress reaches the bond strength. As a bond breaks, fracture is formed and a sustained loading would lead to the propagation of macroscopic crack. BPM has been widely used for rock failure analysis (Potyondy and Cundall, 2004; Hazzard et al., 2000; Fakhimi, 2004; Al-Busaidi et al., 2005; Cho et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2007; Park and Song, 2009; Xia and Zhou, 2010; Zhang and Wong, 2012, 2013; Galouei and Fakhimi, 2015).

C., Confractus, Inc.","|ABSTRACT: An important component of being able to assess the hazard associated with naturally-occurring or induced earthquakes, is a prediction of the likelihood and size of the largest earthquake that could occur in a region. The size-frequency distribution of seismic events, also known as the b value is found to be consistent globally since the seismology community has been measuring and maintaining earthquake data; for this general population of earthquakes b=1. The fact that the b value can vary when earthquake population subsets are made by time, location, and method of occurrence, has led workers to seek a causal relationship to explain that variability by suggesting parameters related to earth stress, hypocenter depth, fluid pumping rate (in the case of induced earthquakes), for example. This paper uses three case studies to propose that the main determinant of the b value is the pre-existing fault and fracture character of the regional geology. Showing this relationship to be true allows the use of surface and subsurface geological mapping to serve as a proxy for earthquake occurrence and prediction of seismic hazard.
1. INTRODUCTION
The parameter b (Gutenberg and Richter, 1942) that describes the size-frequency distribution of earthquakes is equal to 1 when considering a global catalog of earthquakes. The b value can be greater than or less than 1 when analyzing subsets of earthquake populations by depth (Mori and Abercrombe, 1997, Gerstenberger et al., 2001), time (El-Isa and Eaton, 2013, El-Isa, 2013), or stress regime (Schorlemmer et al, 2005, Farrell et al 2009). For microseismicity populations from wellbore stimulation treatments b values as high as 2 are commonly observed (Maxwell et al, 2011, Wessels et al, 2011). Most of the correlative relationships explored in prior work ignore the impact of pre-existing heterogeneities in the geological setting of the earthquakes, except for the obvious relationship of large earthquakes to large existing faults. In contrast, Langenbruch and Shapiro (2013) addressed the pre-existing structure by modeling the b value is impacted when modeling rock failure a fractally-heterogeneous volume. If the b value can be shown to be characteristic of the structural setting in which prior tectonic faulting styles define the geometry of earth heterogeneities, it could prove to be a useful tool for predicting induced earthquake hazard in previously aseismic areas and in areas where seismicity was very low prior to the start of earthquake-inducing activities.|","Document Type

Geomechanics can be crucial for pressure change and production as both formation deformation and locally induced stresses may contribute to skeleton deformation and the pressure change thus production significantly, particularly in low-permeability and fractured formations. Multiphase flow in both the matrix and fractured system can significantly affect the production and pressure results, particularly near a wellbore or a hydraulic fracture. The key parts on developing this model are to come up an efficient algorithm and to define the parameters characterizing the geomechanics coupling to the flow on top of the explicit coupling to the saturation, where upstream weighting normally is applied. The proposed algorithm coupled the pressures from both system with the corresponding volumetric strain and subsequently explicitly coupled to the saturation. Both a generalized Galerkin and Petrov-Galerkin finite methods are used in which mixed quadratic and linear shape functions are implemented respectively for the displacement and pressures, yet only quadratic weighting function is used in the calculation of saturation and for the entire weighting function. A unique weighting function with different P-G coefficient is also proposed and tested for saturation calculation. Results for saturation and pore pressure near a wellbore during a pressurization are generated and discussed, simulating fracturing process in naturally fractured reservoirs.
1. INTRODUCTION
Flow in naturally fractured reservoirs is normally characterized and modeled by the well-known sugar cubic model proposed by Barenblatt et al., [1960] and Warren and Root, [1963]. Extensive studies follow by mixture theory focusing on stress-sensitivity and loosely geomechanics coupling [Wilson and Aifantis, 1982, Beskos and Aifantis, 1986, Huyakorn and Pinder, 1983, Elworth and Bai, 1992, Bai et al 1993] and by an alternatively conventional reservoir-geomechanics coupling model following Biot’s theory [Biot, 1941, Duguid and Lee, 1977, Vallianppan and Khalili-Naghadeh, 1990, Khalili-Naghadh and Valianppan, 1996, 1996, Chen and Teufel, 1997]. Following Vallianppan and Khalili-Naghadeh, 1996, Chen and Teufel [1997], an extended Biot theory coupled the fluid flow to deformation is proposed and implemented. Those critical parameters between stresses and pore pressure and the deformation coupled between pore volume, bulk volume, porous matrix, solid particle, and fractured volume are highlighted. Studies on dual porosity model have been extended into two phase flows [Nair et al., 2005, Bai et al., 1999] by a mixture theory. Following Wang and Chen [2001] in which only a single poroelastic model is proposed, a two phase flow model with extended Biot formulation will be the focus in this paper. Two phase flow during hydraulic fracturing in a fractured formation is of great interest to engineers in petroleum engineering and hydrogeology. Both the over-all production and flow back fluid after a fracturing job are heavily depending on the saturation change near a hydraulic fracture or in the vicinity of a wellbore. Coupling to geomechanics is another important aspect of the issues in the naturally fractured reservoirs. A generalized finite element approach with an extended Galerkin method in which the weighting function consistent with the shape function in pore pressures are used is implemented. A general formulation with four pore pressures and one bulk displacement as the primary variables are presented. Results from an approximated formulation in which an average pore pressure in each medium is used by adding two mass balance equations for different phase, i.e. water and oil are presented. Saturation calculation is validated by an analytical solution.|","Document Type

The suggested method can be used as a quick screening tool to support landing zone decisions in unconventional plays. The workflow combines the essential elements of fracture mechanics for rock mechanical applications to provide a more realistic vision of how a hydraulically induced fracture may grow in the vertical dimension. It incorporates the use of a density log, a log-derived stress profile along with the elastic properties, and the injection pressure to estimate the probability of fracture growth vertically through horizontal bedding planes. The workflow can identify a preferred landing zone for horizontal wells, or alternatively, preferred perforation intervals in the case of vertical wells. The paper illustrates two case studies in shale formations that assess the advantages and limitations of the suggested approach.
1. INTRODUCTION
The determination of well landing zone for horizontal wells or the selection of perforation intervals for vertical wells is a critical decision in unconventional plays. Traditionally in highly permeable formations, rock properties such as porosity and hydrocarbon saturation were adequate for targeting a high quality reservoir. In tight formations with ultra-low permeability, well stimulation is required to improve reservoir conductivity. This warrants accessing the reservoir beyond the borehole via creating hydraulic fractures. In such cases, perforations need to carefully be placed in order to enhance fracture initiation and propagation within a good reservoir quality interval. The problem is graphically shown in Fig 1.
Choosing appropriate landing zone will also assist stimulation design optimization and well pad arrangement in the next stages of field development. The ultimate goal is to achieve well completions with consistent and repeatable fracture geometries with dimensions that maximize accessibility to, and recovery from these tight unconventional reservoirs to deliver profitable long-term production operations (e.g., Azad et al., 2017).|","Document Type

R., Graz University of Technology| Schubert, W., Graz University of Technology","|ABSTRACT: When shield TBMs in hard rock conditions are applied, pea gravel is used to fill the gap between lining and rock mass. A sound knowledge of the deformation properties is required as only the backfill is considered to be relevant for the bedding effectiveness. At present, no measurement method for the in situ determination of these parameters is available. Based on the static load plate test a prototype for the in situ determination of the deformation properties of pea gravel has been designed and manufactured. The stiffness of the backfilled material can be calculated using the recorded measurement data of applied force and load plate displacement. First tests under controlled laboratory conditions confirm the suitability of the presented testing method. Furthermore, the test results have been verified using two independent testing methods. Thereby, the results show that used stiffness parameters in the design stages are generally overestimated. This research focuses on the evaluation of the laboratory tests and verification tests.
1. INTRODUCTION
At mechanized driven tunnels, using single or double shield TBMs (S-TBM/DS-TBM), prefabricated lining segments are used as outer lining. Thereby, the load-carrying rings are assembled within the protection of the shield. Due to the construction method, a gap between lining and rock (i.e. excavation boundary) exists after an installed ring leaves the shield tail. This so-called annular gap needs to be backfilled using a suitable material in order to allow for load transfer. Ideally, the occurring rock loads are evenly distributed. In terms of tunneling in hard rock, a fine grained and closely graded gravel, termed as pea gravel, is used as backfill. Thereby, injection into the annular gap is performed pneumatically through radial openings in the lining segments. The invert area is backfilled using a pea gravel-mortar-mixture.
In the German speaking area, the lining design is mainly carried out using the bedded frame model method. Thereby, the bedding modulus (kr) expresses the interaction between lining and rock mass being simulated by radial bedding springs. The bedding modulus is usually calculated using the stiffness of the ground (Es,G) and the theoretical radius of the lining (R) as shown in Eq. (1). According to Eq. (2), the radial bedding stress (<U+03C3>r) can be calculated using a linear relationship between the radial displacements (ur) and the bedding modulus. However, this simple linear relationship does not fully cover neither the ground-structure interaction, nor any stiffness differences between backfill and rock mass (Behnen et al., 2012).|","Document Type

R., ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company","|ABSTRACT: Felt induced seismicity due to hydraulic fracturing has been observed at many fields in the past few years. Though spatial and temporal correlations establish the link between hydraulic fracturing activities and felt induced seismicity, the underlying stress/pressure change mechanisms that cause fault reactivation are unclear. This study reports a systematic analysis of several felt induced seismicity field observations using geomechanical models to understand the mechanisms that cause the fault reactivation. The field observations indicate that felt induced seismicity occurs at 100s of meters to few kms away from the wellbore and there is a time delay of hours to days. The numerical modeling results of hydraulic fracturing in a low permeability homogeneous medium show that stress and pressure changes attenuate rapidly with distance, unable to explain reasons for the felt induced seismicity at few kms away from the wellbore. Also wells in close proximity, completed similarly produce vastly different seismicity, indicating that local heterogeneity is important. An alternative mechanism, such as a direct hydraulic connection between a hydraulic fracture and fault, found to be consistent with the field observations. The insights gained from the numerical modeling of fracture fault interaction models can be used to develop felt induced seismicity mitigation plans.
1. INTRODUCTION
It is well known that microseismic events (magnitudes of <U+2212>2 and <U+2212>3), which are not felt at the earth’s surface, are created by hydraulic fracturing and that knowledge is used to identify the extent of stimulation. However, felt induced seismic events (magnitude > 2.5) due to hydraulic fracturing have historically been rare, with only 70 felt events for 3 million hydraulic fractures up to early 2010s (US National Academy, 2012). Also, felt induced seismicity due to hydraulic fracturing has been observed in many unconventional plays in recent years. The magnitude 3.8 event in year 2011 in the United Kingdom (de Pater and Baisch, 2011), magnitude 3.0 event in year 2013 in Ohio (Skoumal et al., 2015) and magnitude >4 events in Alberta and British Columbia in years 2013-2016 (Schultz et al., 2017, BC O&G Commission, 2012 and 2014) are some of the recent examples of felt induced seismicity due to hydraulic fracturing.|","Document Type

T., Rockfield Global Technologies| Paw, F., Rockfield Global Technologies| Bere, A. T., Rockfield Global Technologies| Yu, J-G., Rockfield Global Technologies","|ABSTRACT: The evolution of regions exhibiting strike-slip deformation has been explored extensively in bench scale modeling studies [1], [2]. In such studies, analogue materials are used to represent the constitutive behaviour of rocks - typically graded sand is used to represent brittle sediments and silicon polymer gum is used to represent viscous, creeping rheologies e.g. decollements. Via modifying boundary conditions, such experiments are able to study pure strike-slip deformation as well as introduce components of transtension and transpression. The experiments are quite successful in their ability to replicate structures associated with these deformational regimes e.g. flower structures, pull-apart basins, pop-up anticlines. Via newer interrogation methods some quantitative information regarding displacement and strain may be extracted. Regions experiencing transtension typically exhibit regions of strike-slip faulting juxtaposed with extensional structures - grabens and normal faults. These observations are indicative of a complex and potentially non-intuitive stress state which locally may be very different from the ‘regional’ stress state. Numerical modelling offers the opportunity to obtain quantitative information regarding stress, temperature, pore pressure and material state which may be used to assist in planning for exploration and production in such complex regions. However, application of geomechanical modelling to study the evolution of stress in transcurrent settings is limited, likely due to the large deformation, difficult treatment of model boundaries, and the requirement for a fully 3D representation. This paper explores large deformation in transtensional settings using a finite-strain, adaptive finite element code – Elfen fm. The study outlines the underlying computational framework and specifically technology that is used to treat the boundary of the presented models. The adopted material models are described in detail. The models are fully three-dimensional and information regarding the stress and material state both temporally and spatially is shown and discussed. The implications of the findings for exploration and production are emphasised.

E., Missouri University of Science and Technology| Eckert, A., Missouri University of Science and Technology","|ABSTRACT: Ensuring wellbore stability is of major importance during any well completion. Wellbore collapse as a result of severe borehole breakouts represents a major problem in many cases. In order to quantify the risk associated to wellbore collapse a reliable estimate of the collapse volume is necessary. In this study, a novel approach determining the area/volume of collapse failure by using image processing techniques, is presented. The image processing matches results from exemplary data sets, based on a Mohr Coulomb failure criterion, where an analytical solution exists. Since image processing can be applied to any result set, the proposed approach is independent of any failure criterion and very versatile. The determination of breakout width and collapse volume can be used as a proactive tool to estimate the required minimum mud pressure to minimize the resulting collapse volume.
1. INTRODUCTION
The obvious goal for drilling operators is to drill economical, safe, and stable wells by reducing the non-productive time (NPT) due to borehole problems such as stuck pipe. A key issue for successful drilling operations in geomechanically challenging zones is considering all relevant factors including—formation strength properties, in-situ stresses, pore pressure, and applied pressure by the drilling mud. If collected, these data sets of rock strength and stress can be used to generate a Mechanical Earth Model (MEM; e.g. Goodman and Connolly, 2007; Kristiansen, 2007; Gholami et al., 2014). Once the MEM is validated, it can be used to predict applications such as wellbore stability (Cheatham, 1984; Kaushik et al., 2016; Alkamil et al., 2017).
One common source of data for stress determination is based on the analysis of borehole breakouts (Fjaer, 1992). There are different methods for breakout identification such as the conventional four and six arms caliper logs, micro-resistivity logs, and borehole image logs (e.g. Tingay et al., 2008). While these log based data sets are commonly used to infer the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress, SH (Aadnoy and Looyeh, 2011), and can be used to estimate the magnitude of SH (Zoback, 2010), the occurrence of breakouts can also be used to calculate the collapse volume, either analytically using the Kirsch equations or numerically utilizing finite element analysis (Chatterjee and Mukhopadhyay, 2003). One recently presented analytical method approximates the caving area to the area of a triangle and uses the caliper reading as an indicator of the breakout radius (Escobar et al., 2014). However, as also shown in their study, when compared to a numerical model predicting the area of borehole failure, a significant discrepancy of 27% between the analytical and numerical solution remains.|","Document Type

XFEM, unlike Cohesive Zone Method (CZM), allows simulating nucleation and growth of a fracture along an arbitrary, solution-dependent path without re-meshing the material in the bulk. In this work, we have used 2D XFEM coupled with pore-pressure degrees of freedom to simulate a variety of boundary value problems related to fluid-driven (hydraulic) fractures in a permeable medium. Specifically, through these simulations, we investigate the influence of critical geomechanical and operational parameters on hydraulic fracturing, including (a) creation of fracture-tortuosity due to a misalignment between initial perforation and maximum in situ stress direction, (b) impact of in situ stress anisotropy on the near-wellbore fracture geometry, (c) deflection of fracture path due to a spatial pore-pressure gradient, (d) refracturing of an already existing hydraulic fracture, and (e) merging of a hydraulic fracture with a pre-existing natural fracture in the formation. For each of these cases, the predicted fracture geometry is compared with the respective experimental result available in the literature. The simulated and the measured fracture geometries are found to be in good agreement.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing refers to the process of nucleation and growth of fractures inside rock formations by means of flow-induced pressurization (Hubbert and Willis, 1957; Khristianovic and Zheltov, 1955). Hydraulic fracturing is primarily used in the oil and gas industry as a means of stimulating unconventional reservoirs. Examples of unconventional reservoirs include oil and gas shales, tight sandstones, and heavy oil and tar sands. The ease of recovery of hydrocarbons from a given reservoir depends upon the mobility of the hydrocarbons in that reservoir, which is defined as the ratio of formation permeability to the viscosity of the host fluid (hydrocarbons). The mobility of hydrocarbons in unconventional reservoirs is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than that in conventional reservoirs. Because of such ultra-low mobility, the recovery of hydrocarbons from such reservoirs is much more challenging compared to a conventional reservoir. Therefore, often an assertive recovery method such as hydraulic fracturing is required to make the extraction of hydrocarbons from such reservoirs economically viable. Hydraulic fracturing facilitates the recovery of hydrocarbons from unconventional reservoirs by creating conductive channels which provide an easier escape route for the hydrocarbons.|","Document Type

This paper presents an improved 3D numerical model for fluid flow, heat transfer and injection induced microseismicity in a network of fractures. A stochastic fracture network model accounting for fracture spatial distribution and detailed individual fracture properties such as aperture, size and orientation is generated. The connectivity of the fracture network is then identified using a searching algorithm. Fluid is assumed to flow within the interconnected set of fractures. Pressure distribution within the interconnected network is solved from a set of mass balance equations written at each fracture center. The flow pattern on individual fracture planes is then obtained analytically. To model heat transfer, energy conservation is written for each fracture as a balance between convected energy, energy dissipated by conduction and the change of energy retained by the volume of fluid within the fractures. Fracture propagation and shear slippage are simulated integrally to account for their combined effects on fracture network response. Fracture shear slippage is assumed to be governed by the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and the corresponding microseismic events are identified. This model is applied to simulate the response of a large scale fracture network to fluid injection. Simulation results show that during injection, the increase in pressure inside fully connected fractures could lead to slip events and cause some fractures to propagate. The hydraulic conductivity of the fracture network is improved through fracture shear dilation and fracture propagation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Naturally fractured reservoirs contain a significant portion of the world’s petroleum and geothermal reservoirs. Fractures are usually stress sensitive, and they could dilate and slip in shear and possibly propagate as a result of injection induced stress changes, which plays an important role in reservoir permeability enhancement. Numerical modeling of these phenomena can help understand how fractures contribute to the stimulation outcome, which is essential for stimulation optimization. The objective of this study is to develop a numerical model for fluid flow, heat transfer, fracture deformation and induced micro-seismicity in three dimensional fracture networks, and to simulate the response of large-scale natural fracture networks to injection.|","Document Type

P., Swiss Federal Institute of Technology| Rutqvist, J., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","|ABSTRACT: The potential of inducing fault reactivation by a synthetic nuclear waste repository in a clay-stone formation is here investigated. The target clay formation may be expected to be almost impermeable, having self-healing and long-term plastic properties, to make sure the canisters, loaded with high-level radioactive waste, are confined and kept in place, with no migration of radionuclides from the storage tunnels. However, in the initial phase of the storage, the radionuclide decay is responsible for a sharp increase in temperature of ~100°C, expected to peak after about 10-100 years. Concurrently, a fluid pressurization of up to ~10MPa is predicted to peak around 1000-5000 years as a consequence of a temperature increase as high as 20°C in a larger volume surrounding the repository.
Some faults with no significant offset may remain undetected and additionally in-situ stress state may show strong variation for the rock units above and especially below the target storage unit: the combination of pressure and temperature change can then induce relevant stresses on fault planes even outside the storage rock unit. A correct characterization of the potential reactivation of faults depends on the evaluation of the in-situ stresses, the induced stress changes, as well as on the characterization of the failing material. A numerical coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical approach is here proposed to compute stress changes due to radiogenic heating and induced pressurization. Failure takes place following the Mohr-Coulomb criterion and sudden slip is simulated on the reactivated faults by accounting for a strain-softening friction evolution.
1. INTRODUCTION
Long term storage of nuclear waste is a problem that must be addressed at the industrial scale in the near future. The long term mechanical and hydrological confinement of the radionuclides must be guaranteed. This requires the construction of an underground geological repository, where the sealing properties of the hosting geologic formation may be enhanced by one or more engineered barriers. For example, in the Swiss geological and tectonic settings the Opalinus Clay formation is the preferred hosting formation, with additional sealing provided by an engineered barrier, including a buffer of swelling bentonite clay surrounding the waste canister (NAGRA, 2002; Delage et al., 2010).|","Document Type

F., ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company","|ABSTRACT: This paper presents a fully coupled finite element model to simulate hydraulic fracturing (HF) in rocks. The step rate test, a common diagnostic test for designing HF treatments, is simulated to demonstrate the model’s capabilities. In the model, the rock deformation is fully coupled with the pore-fluid Darcy flow and the fracture is modeled using specialized cohesive zone elements that simulate Darcy flow in undamaged state which smoothly transitions to a tangential Poiseuille flow when fully damaged. Fluid leak-off into the formation and near wellbore damage effects are also accounted for. Specialized pipe elements are used to model the wellbore fluid flow including the frictional losses. Using this model, a field-scale step rate test is simulated, with thoroughly calibrated material properties and in-situ stresses. It is shown that the model can match the entire pressure history of the test, including the flow regime transition from pure matrix flow to fully developed fracture growth and the shut-in leak-off response. It can also predict the formation breakdown pressure, showing it to be higher than theoretical estimates, which is critical for injection system pump design. The model is further used to gain insights on the fracture behavior.
1. INTRODUCTION
The technology of hydraulic fracturing today has revolutionized the global energy landscape by enabling economic production of fossil fuels from very low permeability reservoirs. It has also proven to be very useful for several other applications, such as drill waste and produce water disposal, wellbore integrity analysis and formation in-situ stress measurement. This has led to significant research contributions towards understanding the mechanics behind it and the development of numerical modeling capabilities (Adachi et al., 2007; Carrier and Granet, 2012; Hu and Garagash, 2010; Hunsweck et al, 2013; Lecampion, 2009; Peirce and Detournay, 2008; Warpinski et al., 1994). Many of these full physics based capabilities developed in academia have been verified with 2D problems, but not quantitatively applied to and validated at a full 3D field scale. Consequently the fracture modeling in industry predominantly has to rely on pseudo-3D fracture geometry assumptions (Meyer, 1989) being unable to fully reap the benefit of these developments.
Recently, a fully coupled 3D finite element modeling capability to simulate hydraulic fracturing was co-developed by ExxonMobil and Dassault Systemes (Searles et al., 2016) using the finite element software Abaqus®. This capability was verified via comparisons with published analytical solutions as well as successfully validated against a suite of laboratory scale hydraulic fracture experiments (Zielonka et al., 2014; Ning et al, 2015). In this paper the goal is to demonstrate the 3D, field-scale predictive capability of this model by simulating the step rate test (Nolte, 2000) - a typical diagnostic test used in the oil and gas industry to design various aspects of a hydraulic fracture treatment.|","Document Type

The production from these reservoirs are feasible through hydraulic fracturing. An important issue regarding hydraulic fracturing is the production loss due to the creep-induced closure of fractures. This paper reports a study on the influence of elevated temperature on the creep deformation of shale rocks. To this end, a series of multi-stage triaxial creep tests differing in stress conditions and temperature is carried out on two samples of the Mancos shale, one cored parallel and the other normal to the bedding. Results indicate a significant increase in the creep rate due to increasing the temperature. It is also observed that the sample cored parallel to the bedding exhibits higher stiffness and a lower creep strain rate compared to the one cored normal to the bedding.
1. INTRODUCTION
Recently, a great deal of attention has been drawn to unconventional shale gas reservoirs. Hydraulic fracturing, and horizontal drilling makes production from these reservoirs possible. The main characteristics of these reservoirs include low permeability, high organic content and small grain size. Therefore, it is essential to create an effective network of fractures to provide enough surface area in such reservoirs. This has been achieved through hydraulic fracturing.
Creep deformations result in a reduction in the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing over time [1]. Creep also impacts the stress state around the wellbore, resulting in its deformation and occasionally serious damage or instability.
Creep deformation and its rate have been shown to be significantly influenced by environmental conditions [2]. One of the environmental conditions that can substantially impact the creep rate is temperature, which is generally believed to increase the strain rate and potentially promote failure. This is particularly the case at depth where the temperature and stresses around the wellbore increase. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the influence of elevated temperature on the creep deformation of rocks.|","Document Type

E., Oklahoma State University| Atashnezhad, A., Oklahoma State University| Hareland, G., Oklahoma State University","|ABSTRACT: This paper describes a method for determining permeability variations for a continuous interval utilizing conventional drilling data for sandstone and shale reservoirs. The drilling data is used to find the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) within a well using an inverted rate of penetration (ROP) model. Previously published core and cuttings data for sandstone and shale reservoirs are used to create correlations for UCS and porosity as well as porosity and permeability. Porosity values can be calculated at any UCS values, and applied to the porosity and permeability correlation for the specific reservoir. This yields a permeability value for a specific reservoir at a given UCS. The verification of the correlation was done with permeability data from two wells penetrating the Montney shale and Nikanassin sandstone formations in British Columbia, Canada. The permeability calculation for the Montney and Nikanassin formations was compared to the permeability obtained from core and cuttings analysis data and a comparison between trend and accuracy can be done.
1. INTRODUCTION
Permeability determination can be a challenging task, but has proven advantageous to stimulation design and reservoir characterization. Determination of shale permeability has proven to be vastly different from the techniques employed for finding permeability in conventional reservoir rock (Moghadam and Chalaturnyk, 2015). The most common technique used to determine shale permeability is the GRI technique, but one of the downsides associated with this method is that the sample sizes used can alter the permeability results (Tinni et al., 2012). Civan et al., 2013, investigated the effect of Darcian flow on shale permeability and proposed that this method has the potential to predict shale permeability for a variety of conditions. One way that sandstone permeability can be determined is through the use of sonic and electrical logs, but these logs can be ineffective if shales are present (Jiang et al., 2013). Well logs can be used in conjunction with artificial neural networks or multiple regression analysis for permeability estimation (Pereira, 2004). There are also numerous correlations that utilize well logs to empirically determine permeability, including but not limited to the Timur, Tixier, and Coates-Dumanois, and Coates methods (Mohaghegh et al., 1997). Many of these empirically calculated permeability methods require knowledge of the irreducible water saturation, and often these correlations can be vastly different from core analysis results (Hunt and Pursell, 1997). One common issue with log methods is that depth correction between logs and core samples must be performed in order to obtain accurate results (Deng et al., 2013). Pressure transient data obtained from Wireline Formation Testers (WFT) can also be used for permeability determination, but it has been observed that this method may not be accurate in heterogeneous formations (Ramaswami et al., 2016). The cost of running WFT’s can reduce the number of measurements taken in a well and can sometimes misrepresent the permeability for the entire zone in question (Li et al., 2016).|","Document Type

This analysis does not consider the effect of the gravity induced irregularity of the lateral forces on the tunnels. The intensity and irregularity of these lateral forces on the tunnel can also be influenced by the shape of the tunnel. Using the DEM approach, the gravity induced lateral forces on a vertical boundary near tunnels in cemented granular materials were obtained. It was determined that these lateral forces were irregularly distributed not only in their values but in their allocation as well. The irregularity of the force distribution and their allocation were evaluated using the fractal dimension concept from fractal theory. Different shaped openings affected the lateral force distributions, which leads to different values of the ratio between the values of the lateral and the vertical loads. Therefore, the irregularity of the lateral force distributions in boundaries near tunnels of different shape should be used in their design.
1. INTRODUCTION
Tunnels are an important type of underground structures and has been widely built for public transportation, flood discharge, and other purposes such as network, communication and electricity cable installation. When designing these tunnels, the simplifying assumptions made by the designers are that both the vertical and lateral loads are uniformly distributed on the boundaries, and the lateral load is a fraction of the vertical load. Models of tunnel excavations in this stress state, namely far-field stress state, are often discussed in the text books of rock mechanics and engineering geology due to its significance as basic teaching and learning tools for understanding the mechanisms of underground excavations [1-3].
Based on these assumptions, a number of theoretical solutions have been developed to analyze problems associated with underground constructions. The complete solutions for stress and displacement distributions around circular and elliptical opening were originally given by Kirsch [4] and Bray [5], respectively. Theoretical solutions for stress distribution of different shaped tunnels [6, 7], lined tunnels [8, 9], arbitrary cross section of tunnels [10, 11], tunnels considering the influence of ground reinforcement [12] and groundwater [13] have also been presented. These analytical solutions explain the mechanics of generation of stress and deformation that occur due to the excavation of tunnels in rock and soil. Many stress analysis of tunnel behaviour have been developed using numerical methods. Finite element method (FEM) was employed to model the excavation of deep tunnels [14] and to investigate the in-situ rock stress near excavation boundaries [15, 16].|","Document Type

1. INTRODUCTION
Concrete is a popular structural material used in Civil Engineering applications. As for any material, condition of concrete may be affected by the quality of design, manufacturing, loads applied to a structure, character of the loads, environmental deterioration, or aging. Condition of concrete plays a key role for safety of structures (Kim et al., 2005). Non-destructive ultrasonic evaluation (NDE) is commonly used for assessment of civil infrastructure and characterization of construction materials. Among the acoustic methods the impact echo, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), and surface waves analysis can be distinguished (McCann and Forde, 2001), (Popovics, 2003). The latest trends focuses more on attenuation of wave front (Aggelis et al., 2005), (Kirlangic et al., 2015) and more sensitive methods for detecting changes in velocity (e.g. Coda Wave Interfefometry (Dai et al., 2013), (Planes and Larose, 2013), (Snieder, 2006)). Wave velocity depends on the medium properties, therefore UPV method is a very popular technique used in NDE in Civil Engineering.

This method estimates the stope size required to reduce operational hazards and achieve continuous production. Over time several improvements have taken place, as well as the addition of new cases. These new cases are relevant and need to be collected in order to update the stability graph, improving its reliability in predicting the stability state of open stopes.
The addition of new case studies involves two main stage, that systematically performed allow to update the graph and delineating more reliable stability boundaries. The first stage required the collection of geotechnical data, and the second one, consider a back analysis of stopes, performance parameters and the assignation of stability state to each case.
The main problems related to both stages have been identified by the authors in Chilean mining operations: The geotechnical data is frequently collected and stored under different conditions and the calculations of performance parameters do not accurately performed. For this purpose, several computational tools have been developed and integrated into a software, MineRoc. MineRoc allows defining the optimal open stope size and the stability graph method can be adapted to a particular local mining context, based on local case studies and own definitions of stability. The software includes four modules: Acquisition, Performance, Database and Design.
In this work, an application of the software is performed and the main features of MineRoc are presented. New Chilean case studies have been collected and used to establish new stability boundaries. Finally, it's possible to evaluate the benefits of the software, and its positive impact on the mine planning a design process, since more accurate predictions of stopes stability and incorporation of overbreak can be performed.

The beginning of stable crack growth is called the crack initiation stress while the beginning of unstable microcracking is called the crack damage stress. This laboratory study presents a new technique for estimation of crack initiation threshold. The technique is based on the interpretation of measured ultrasonic attenuation. The attenuation method was tested on the set of 4 granite specimens during the uniaxial loading. The attenuation based crack initiation stresses were comparable with those determined by interpretation of stress-strain data and acoustic emission data. |1. INTRODUCTION |The process of failure of low-porosity rocks depends on their mechanical properties and actual stress and temperature conditions. At low pressure and low temperature, brittle failure is most common. This is a progressive process requiring the initiation, growth and coalescence of cracks (Lockner, 1993). Stress strain behavior of low-porosity crystalline rocks during laboratory compression experiments is divided into four characteristic stages: crack closure, elastic region, stable crack growth and unstable crack growth which leads to brittle failure, (Brace et al., 1966; Bieniawski, 1967; Lajtai, 1974). |The fracturing process of stressed rock begins with crack initiation (<U+03C3>ci), which for low-porosity rocks occurs approximately at 40-50% of peak strength (<U+03C3>p) (Cai et al., 2004; Nicksiar and Martin, 2013). After <U+03C3>ci, dilatancy begins and stable crack growth follows up to the crack damage threshold (<U+03C3>cd), which is approximately at 80% of <U+03C3>p (Cai et al., 2004). After crossing the <U+03C3>cd, there is unstable crack growth accompanied with nucleation of the failure zone (<U+03C3>n) at 97-100% of <U+03C3>p (Rao et al., 2011). The stress drop accompanied with the formation of a macro-scale shear failure follows after peak stress is crossed. |Throughout stable crack growth, the generation and propagation of tension cracks is supposed to be dominant (Tapponnier and Brace, 1976; Martin and Chandler, 1994). Because the tension cracks are parallel to the maximum compressive stress, they cause a nonlinear increase in lateral strain while the axial strain remains linear with increasing stress. In the plane perpendicular to maximum stress, these tension cracks also decrease elastic wave velocities while increasing elastic wave attenuation, velocity anisotropy and shear wave splitting (Stanchits et al., 2006). After crossing <U+03C3>ci, there is an onset in acoustic emission (AE) activity (Eberhardt et al., 1998). When isotropic material is fractured, random space distribution and dominance of tension source types is characteristic for AE events at this stage of loading (Stanchits et al., 2006).|","Document Type

F., SINTEF Petroleum Research| Li, L., SINTEF Petroleum Research| Fj<U+00E6>r, E., SINTEF Petroleum Research","|ABSTRACT: It has been shown that some shale formations form barriers around a casing of a well due to shale creep that results in closure and sealing of the annulus around the casing. The existence of such shale barriers facilitates plug and abandonment (P&A) operations, which includes significant cost reductions. The question is whether barrier-forming shale creep or plastic deformation can be stimulated if no barrier has been formed over the lifetime of the well. Recent laboratory experiments with core plugs from different field-shale facies as well as numerical simulations suggest that controlled heating may help stimulate plastic deformation in shale that may result in shale barriers. The experimental results show that undrained heating under deviatoric stress may result in large plastic shear strains. Thermo-hydro-mechanically coupled finite-element simulations confirm that heating of a well may result in a sufficiently strong reduction of the borehole radius to close the gap between shale formation and casing.
1. INTRODUCTION
Long-term sealing of oil/gas-production wells at the end of field life, so-called plug and abandonment (P&A) operations, is very costly for off-shore wells, and the oil industry is therefore looking for low-cost solutions. Previously, it was demonstrated that some shale formations in the overburden have the ability to form seals around a casing (Williams et al., 2009), which is attributed to shale creep (Fj<U+00E6>r et al., 2016). In this case, the casing could be left in the ground within a plugging zone, and significant costs for casing removal could be saved. However, not all shale formations form seals, and the question is if shale creep and seal formation can be stimulated to prevent the need for casing removal, e.g. by pressure drawdown in the annulus around the casing. Another possibility for stimulating plastic deformations in shales, as investigated in the present study, is controlled heating. Heating may result in enhanced creep rates and/or reduced rock strength. Maybe more importantly, heating of a low-permeability shale formation results in a pore pressure increase in the heated zone since thermal expansion of the pore fluid is generally larger than that of the rock matrix (often by one or two orders of magnitude for shale permeabilities in the nano-Darcy range). For shales, heat diffusion is usually faster than hydraulic diffusion, which limits or nearly suppresses pore fluid drainage during heating. A thermally induced increase in pore pressure leads to a reduction of effective stress, which under the shear stresses present around a wellbore, may result in plastic shear deformation. In this work, we show that moderate heating may result in sufficiently large plastic deformations to close the annulus between shale formation and casing (typically a few cm). Whether such deformations would also result in a hydraulic seal remains to be studied.|","Document Type

This begins with the formation of micro-fractures at low stresses and subsequent transition into the development of a macroscopic failure plane at its ultimate strength. These fractures, when monitored through active ultrasonic signals, tend to act as low-pass filters that attenuate the waveforms. In present study, active seismic monitoring was conducted on Lyon’s Sandstone specimens while they were subjected to uniaxial compression. A Lab-view controlled seismic system with sampling frequency of 100 MHz was used to acquire seismic waveforms in real time. In the experiments, the effect of ultrasonic transducers on the seismic measurements was investigated using two different P-wave transducers. The transducers were coupled to the rock specimen at different locations along its axial length so that the wave transmission is normal to the major principal stress direction. Under the application of load, changes in seismic velocities and amplitude of the active signals with respect to the stress magnitudes were processed for characterization of crack initiation (CI) and crack damage (CD) stress thresholds. The possible mechanisms for seismic attenuation based on the friction dissipation model and displacement discontinuity model have also been put forward.
1. INTRODUCTION
The formation of extensile micro-fractures is associated with yielding of brittle rocks at stresses below the ultimate compressive strength. The stress corresponding to the initiation of the cracks is defined as the Crack Initiation (CI) threshold, while Crack Damage (CD) is the stress threshold at which the accumulated cracks in the rock begin to coalesce, ultimately leading to formation of a failure surface at the peak strength (Ghazvinian, 2015). Traditional shear failure criterions over-estimate the in-situ strength of brittle rocks at low confining stresses by not accounting for damage caused to the rock by the formation of these micro-fractures (Martin, 1997; Diederichs, 2003). Characterization of damage thresholds is therefore vital for an accurate prediction of brittle rock strength. The present study focuses on identifying rock fracturing processes and the associated damage mechanisms which consequently can lead to a precise determination of these rock damage thresholds. In this paper, the terms fractures, cracks and discontinuities have been used interchangeably.|","Document Type

C., NGI| Grande, L., NGI| Soldal, M., NGI","|ABSTRACT: This study presents the feasibility of performing permeability measurement by interpretation of consolidation-induced time-dependent deformation of sample when an instant pore pressure pulse is applied. For the interpretation of measured transient behavior, a procedure to back-calculate permeability from measured consolidation strain is developed. The estimation shows promising results that gave similar order of magnitude of permeability compared to that measured from steady state method. However, this study shows that creep behavior affects the interpretation of permeability significantly as the effective stress increases. This study indicates that proper calibration of creep effect is important to get reliable values. This study also present some recommendations to optimize the results.
1. INTRODUCTION
Permeability measurement using the steady-state method requires much time for low permeable lithologies (e.g. shale or mud stone), leading to very long experimental time if the aim is several permeability measurements per test. For example, it may take more than one week for one permeability measurement for low permeable rock. However, if an instant pressure pulse loading can capture the transient/consolidation behavior within some hours and the measurement can be converted to the permeability, it can provide a cost and time effective alternative test method.
Change in pore pressure of porous material change the stress conditions acting on its grain structure, which is known as the effective stress. Consequently, the pore volume changes due to expulsion/influx of the pore fluid that occupies the void spaces, a process known as consolidation (or primary consolidation) (Biot, 1941; Terzhaghi, 1943). Thus, hydraulic parameters, especially the permeability, can be deduced from the consolidation-induced deformation, which is strongly coupled with hydraulic behaviour.
As schematically illustrated in Figure 1a, we can assume two-way 1-D consolidation condition when the pore pressure at the top and bottom boundaries change rapidly with a step function of <U+0394><U+03A1>, which is labeled ‘pulse-loading’ hereafter. After the pulse loading, the pore pressure will be gradually dissipated from the top and bottom to the middle of the specimen over time (i.e. red curves in left Figure 1a). Consequently, as shown in Figure 1b, associated volume changes may continue until the pore pressure becomes fully dissipated or reaches steady-state condition.|","Document Type

Microscopic observations show that non-layered, relatively coarser and hard silicate minerals are embedded within a mixed clay and organic matrix. Different from the relatively coarser silicate minerals, the tiny sizes of clay particles make the selection of indentation depth important in determining the elasticity of the clay matrix (that may include the organic in the pores). In this study, the Young’s moduli of core fragments of shales obtained from a borehole of shale formation located in Sichuan, China were probed by the continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) method of nanoindentation using a massive indentation scheme. The Young’s modulus of each indent was obtained as a continuous function of indentation depth. Statistical deconvolutions were respectively conducted based on the data obtained at different depths of each individual indent. The results show the Young’s moduli of diverse phases and show further that the elasticity of each phase exhibits depth-dependent behavior. This study provides a reliable guidance for selecting the appropriate indentation depth to characterize the elasticity of shale as well as the moduli of each individual phases.
1. INTRODUCTION
Shale, a type of fine-grained sedimentary rock, is mainly composed of clay minerals and other secondary minerals (e.g., quartz and pyrite), as well as organic matter that exists primarily in the voids within the clay matrix. Young’s modulus of shale is one of the most important parameters for geophysical subsurface exploration in the oil industry, and the conventional method for the determination of elastic modulus requires the industry to carry out static or dynamic experiments on core samples. In the past two decades, nanoindentation has been widely used to probe the small-scale mechanical properties (e.g., Young’s modulus and hardness) of different materials (Hou et al., 2016; Li and Bhushan, 2002; Liu, 2015; Oliver and Pharr, 2004; Saha and Nix, 2002; Song et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2009), which also shows its applicability to the testing of shales. To determine Young’s modulus of shales, nanoindentation testing can be performed on small pieces of shales making it much less expensive when compared with the conventional methods. Furthermore, since nanoindentation testing is often considered to be non-destructive, it allows more than one test to be performed on each specimen and helps minimize the potential of random errors.|","Document Type

W., Imperial College","|ABSTRACT: The potential growth of multiple fractures is investigated during the deformation of the caprock of a reservoir during the subsurface sequestration of CO2. Multiple scenarios of the interaction of pre-existing natural fractures are investigated, as a function of induced stress changes due to the temperature contrast between the injected CO2 and the reservoir. Simulations are performed at the field scale, on a simplified geologically-informed model of the Heletz pilot test site, Israel, in the framework of the EU-sponsored TRUST project. The potential reactivation and growth of pre-existing natural fractures is investigated. During cold injection, changes in the strain field around the well are tracked. The progression of the temperature plume is observed to cause a local release of stresses that in turn causes short propagation episodes, which mostly focus on downward growth. Although some upwards growth is modeled, growth is expected to prominently occur towards the reservoir.
1. INTRODUCTION
CO2 sequestration aims to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and mitigate anthropogenic climate change (IPCC, 2005). One of its major risks at the industrial scale, is reservoir caprock failing to contain CO2. Considering that injected subcritical CO2 is buoyant in brine, containment relies on the caprock continuity and integrity (Bachu, 2008). Identifying operational parameters for CO2 sequestration, e.g. injection pressure and temperature, which can alter the stress state of the caprock and create leakage pathways, is key to achieving an efficient and secure long-term storage (Oldenburg, 2007).
The coupling of thermo-hydro-mechanical processes is approached by numerical simulators using different techniques that allow to combine the solution of flow and deformation equations either iterative or simultaneously, by using either a single or multiple numerical methods. In iterative coupling geomechanical and flow modules exchange information after each iteration, and so, change in porosity due to geomechanics is added to the flow module as a boundary or initial condition (Settari and Walters, 1999). This method often requires two different grids to be used in the mechanics and flow modules, which may introduce errors in the pressure and strains (Goumiri and Prevost, 2010). The second approach, is fully coupled, where on the basis of poroelasticity, differential equations for mechanics and fluids are solved simultaneously (Zimmerman, 2000). A more detailed representation of the physical problem, is offered by fully coupled THM models with the incorporation of two-phase change phenomena for CO2, i.e. gas and vapor, achieved by solving explicitly their mass conservation equations (Tong et al., 2010). The two different coupling approaches produce different results in the case of CO2 sequestration modelling (Preisig and Prevost, 2011); especially when analyzing temperature contrast between caprock and reservoir these can be significant. Modeling thermo-hydro-mechanical effects with the highest level of accuracy is crucial as to capture changes in the stress field of the caprock that can eventually cause failure of the seal.|","Document Type

W., The University of Arizona","|ABSTRACT: This paper deals with the following two shortcomings of the smooth joint contact model (SJCM) used in the particle flow code (PFC): (a) Use of a constant value for joint normal stiffness instead of allowing actual non-linear behavior between the joint normal deformation and joint normal stress; (b) The so called “interlocking problem”. The first one is solved by imposing a linear relation between the joint normal stiffness and the normal contact stress in a new modified smooth-joint contact model (MSJCM). A good agreement obtained between the results from the experimental tests and the numerical modeling of the compression joint normal test, shows the accuracy of this new model. The second shortcoming occurs due to a lack of an updating procedure in the PFC software related to the contact conditions of the particles that lie around the intended joint plane during high shear displacements. This problem increases the shear strength of the joint when the shear displacement of the joint exceeds a specific value and creates unwanted fractures around the intended joint plane. To solve this problem a new approach termed joint side checking (JSC) is proposed. Numerical modeling of the direct shear test shows JSC can solve the interlocking problem and proves to be more consistent with the theory compared to the regular approach.
1. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, through the development of commercially available Distinct Element Method (DEM) software packages on one hand and accessibility to extremely fast computers on the other hand, DEM has become popular in geomechanics (Cundall, 1971 & 1980; Cundall Strack, 1979; Cundall 1988; Itasca, 2016; Kulatilake et al., 1993; Wu and Kulatilake 2012; Kulatilake and Biao, 2015; Shreedharan and Kulatilake 2016). DEM is a discontinuum mechanics based method in which material is modeled by rigid or deformable blocks/particles, and Newton’s second law acts between blocks/particles. The Particle Flow Code (PFC) as a DEM software package uses rigid disks and spherical elements to represent particles in 2D and 3D, respectively. Since PFC can properly model the fracture initiation and propagation between particles by Bonded-Particle Models (BPMs) as well as sliding along joints by Smooth-Joint Contact Model (SJCM), it is a powerful technique to model jointed rock masses (Potyondy and Cundall, 2004; Mas Ivars, 2011; Potyondy, 2015).|","Document Type

J., The University of Queensland| Alehossein, H., University of Southern Queensland","|ABSTRACT: The Brazilian test is one of the most established techniques used for indirect measurement of rock tensile strength. When the test is applied to soft to medium strength rocks, the rupture mechanism is always through the formation of a single diametrical crack initiated at the centre of the disc, where the induced tensile stress is the maximum. However, when applied to disc specimens of harder, stiffer and brittle rocks, secondary shear fractures often interfere adversely with the diametrical (characteristic) tensile crack in the Brazilian test. To prevent such undesirable shear cracking, a series of Brazilian tests on specimens of different sizes was carried out with four different brittle rocks, including granite, basalt and two types of monzonite. From the results, it is concluded that the problem associated with the undesirable shear failure developed in the vicinity of the contact points can be effectively eliminated through a change in the size of the disc in the Brazilian test.
1. INTRODUCTION
The split cylinder test, also known as the Brazilian test, is the preferred laboratory technique for measuring the tensile strength of a wide range of rock-like materials. The test simply involves compressing a thin solid disc through the application of two diametrally opposite point (line) loads until the disc fails along its loaded diameter into two roughly equal halves (ISRM, 1978; ASTM, 2016). However, despite its ease of use and continued popularity, the validity of the test for materials having a high ratio of compressive to tensile strength, e.g. as in hard rocks, has been questioned in the literature by many researchers (Fairhurst,1964; Hudson et al., 1972; Cranmer and Richerson, 1988; Swab et al., 2011). The main concern is the type of failure reported for such materials, due to the typical formation of multiple cracks and shear ruptures in the vicinity of the contact points, rather than a single crack at the disc’s centre (Ovri and Davies, 1987; Serati et al., 2015). Obtaining a measure of the tensile strength where there is not a single central splitting crack is generally believed to be erroneous, unreliable and misleading. As partial solutions to this dillema, the Brazilian test has been continuously modified over the years, and new testing techniques have been proposed. These include development of the Ring test (Ripperger and Davids, 1947) and the flattened Brazilian disc test (Wang et al., 2003), as well as introducing loading arc platens for strip (distributed) loading of the Brazilian disc (Erarslan and Williams, 2012). All these tests have been shown to be able to successfully eliminate the shear fracturing and crack branching in the Brazilian test, but each also has its own limitations. For instance, the available closed-form solutions for the Ring test are often limited to simplified stress assumptions at the boundaries that may not properly represent the true contact conditions (Serati and Williams, 2015). The flattened Brazilian disc requires additional machining to prepare the flat ends, and the results are highly affected by the flatness and parallelness of the flat ends prepared.|","Document Type

INTRODUCTION |Seismic velocity and attenuation anisotropy is an important property of many crustal and mantle rocks. The velocity anisotropy characterizes a directionally dependent propagation velocity of seismic waves, whereas attenuation anisotropy controls directionally dependent dissipation of seismic energy. The role of velocity and attenuation anisotropy in understanding the evolution of the Earth crust and upper mantle is becoming increasingly important, because the measured anisotropy has a structural origin. Major constituents of the upper and lower crust are felsic and mafic gneisses. Seismic anisotropy observed in upper mantle rocks (peridotite, pyroxenite) is mainly due to crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine and pyroxene, respectively (e.g. Babuska, 1984). Whereas the CPO-based calculated velocities and anisotropy describe the intrinsic (matrix) properties of a rock, the experimental velocity data describe the seismic properties of the real rock, controlled by the rock matrix and the effect of microcracks and grain boundaries. These extrinsic effects are strongly affected by pressure and temperature. In the last years, the minerals of the serpentine group (chrysotile, lizardite and antigorite) have received increasing interest because they play an important role in the dynamics of subduction zones (see Morales et al., submitted and references therein). The different types of serpentine are a result of mantle wedge hydration and represent different levels in subductions zones, according to their different stability at P and T conditions (e.g. Ulmer and Trommsdorff, 1995; Hacker et al., 2003a, 2003b). Antigorite is stable up to pressures of 5 GPa and temperatures around 600°C (Ulmer and Trommsdorff, 1995) and antigorite-rich serpentinites are characterized by a strong CPO of antigorite (e.g. Ji et al., 2013; Shao et al., 2014, Kern et al., 2015). Compared to the numerous papers referring to modeled (e.g. Jung, 2011; Watanabe et al., 2014) and measured seismic properties (Vp, Vs) of antigorite serpentinites (Ji et al., 2013; Shao et al., 2014, Kern et al., 1997), the papers reporting experimental measurements of velocity anisotropy and its pressure dependence are very rare. As regards attenuation of rocks, the papers reporting measurements of attenuation anisotropy and its pressure dependence are quite exceptional. Measuring and determining anisotropic attenuation and its parameters is complicated from the technical as well as theoretical points of view. Klima et al., 1962 investigated the pressure dependence of the attenuation of the P-waves in diabase and greywacke. To our knowledge the only measurements of wave attenuation of antigorite serpentinite are reported by Kern et al. (1997). They measured the P- and S-wave velocities and their attenuation on a sample cube in three fabric-related orthogonal directions at pressures up to 600 MPa and temperatures to 700°C. This paper presents a unique laboratory study of joint measurements of velocity and attenuation anisotropy of antigorite serpentinite in 3D coverage together with their pressure dependency up to 400 MPa. Since ray velocity and ray attenuation are measured in the experiment, the ray quantities are recalculated to the phase quantities, and then inverted for parameters of general triclinic velocity and attenuation anisotropy. The variations of the pressure-induced velocity and attenuation anisotropy are analyzed in detail in the symmetry directions of velocity and amplitude extremes which relate to the mineral fabric (foliation, lineation) and of microcrack fabric (microcrack alignment).|","Document Type

It usually presents a time-dependent failure process consisting of initiation, propagation, and stabilization stages. Most previous numerical modeling studies of this problem focused on vertical wells, whereas numerical simulation of breakouts for deviated wells is rare. In this paper, fully coupled hydro-mechanical models are developed using the finite element method for predicting borehole breakouts in both vertical and deviated wells. Effects of well inclination and fluid seepage from wellbore to formation during overbalance drilling are investigated. The simulation results show that the breakout direction of a deviated wellbore is not necessarily parallel to the direction of the minimum principal stress as compared to that of a vertical wellbore. After an exposure time with overbalanced drilling mud pressure, the wellbore can have a final breakout shape that is much larger than the initial one due to seepage induced stress changes around the wellbore. The proposed models provide a useful tool for understanding and predicting time-dependent wellbore breakouts for drilling practices.
1. INTRODUCTION
Borehole breakouts are one of the major wellbore instability problems in both vertical and deviated wells. Field observations have shown that breakout is a phenomenon where falling rock spalls from the wellbore wall (Bell and Gough, 1979; Gough and Bell, 1982; Peska and Zoback, 1995; Zoback et al., 1985). Specifically, borehole breakouts are time-dependent failure processes, which consist of three stages: initiation, propagation, and stabilization (Cheatham, 1993; Moore et al., 2011; Olcott et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 1989). The breakout initiation is caused by stress concentrations around wellbores. The breakout propagation and stabilization are caused by fluid flow in near-wellbore formations (Cheatham, 1993). Borehole breakouts are normally time-consuming and expensive to fix in drilling operations. Therefore, there is a need to develop a comprehensive hydro-mechanical model for accurate prediction of time-dependent wellbore breakouts.|","Document Type

In all tests performed, a single straight plane of fracture was observed. Through finite element numerical modelling and high-speed photography of the fracture process, the rupture mechanism was further confirmed to be the result of an indirect tensile stress induced inside the specimens. Based on the results, it is concluded that truncated Brazilian specimens can conveniently be adopted to determine the tensile strength of a target material, rather than the standard disc profiles in which catastrophic local cracking makes the procedure unreliable.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Brazilian (splitting) test has been studied extensively in the literature since it was first introduced in the early 1940s. It is now a popular and preferred indirect method to measure the tensile strength of rock, pavement, concrete, and similar building materials. The test simply involves splitting a thin solid disc loaded by a compressive line load to generate a compression-induced tensile stress inside the disc until it fails across its loaded diameter into almost two equal hemi-cylinders (ISRM, 1978; ASTM, 2016). However, despite the test being widely accepted in geomechanics, test results with rock-like geo and construction materials having a large brittleness index (i.e. a high ratio of compressive to tensile strength, as in hard rocks, ceramic, alloys, and diamond composites) have been extensively criticised and proved not to be generally reliable (Fairhurst,1964; Hudson et al., 1972; Cranmer and Richerson, 1988; Yu et al., 2009; Swab et al., 2011; Serati, 2014). The main reason for the lack of reliability in testing such materials is the concentration of unwanted cracks developed in the vicinity of the contacts, which adversely interfere with the tensile breakage of disc specimens through the formation of triple-cleft fractures, inverse conical shear plugs, and multiple cracking (Ovri and Davies, 1987; Fahad, 1996; Serati et al., 2015). Therefore, the flexural tensile strength measured at the centre of a Brazilian disc often tends to overestimate the actual tensile strength in such hard and brittle engineering or natural materials. Nevertheless, this failure to achieve the standard breakage in the Brazilian test has been ignored in most cases since the reasons responsible for such catastrophic crushing are not yet fully understood.|","Document Type

We tested three different samples of each sandstone under dry and liquid (brine, and dodecane) saturated conditions using a multistage triaxial test (Pagoulatos, 2004). In this multistage technique, we define a crack propagation threshold based on the net volumetric strain at the onset of dilatancy as termination criterion between axial loading stages. Each of the multistage experiments allowed us to define a linear failure envelope using a single sample. We measured the tensile strength using a separate suite of samples for Brazilian tensile testing. Our findings suggest a reduction of compressive and tensile rock strength by up to 40% and 45%, respectively in fluid saturated rocks; the magnitude of this strength reduction is fluid type and lithology dependent, greatest reduction happened in more porous rocks while saturated with brine.
1. INTRODUCTION
This experimental study provides insight of the dependence of rock strength on saturating fluids. Fluid saturated rocks are generally weaker than dry rocks, although the magnitude of this difference is lithology and fluid dependent. More often than not, mechanical tests under liquid saturated conditions are rare, and strength measurements in dry samples are typically extrapolated to strength at in-situ reservoir saturations.
The compressive strength of rocks depends on confining pressure. However, the vast majority of compressive strength measurements reported in the literature come from unconfined tests. Multiple conventional triaxial tests, in as many samples, are necessary to define a failure envelope that describes the dependence of compressive strength on confining pressure. This study uses a multistage triaxial following the protocol presented by Pagoulatos (2004). The multistage test eliminates sample variability and overcomes the limited availability constraint of the conventional triaxial tests.
Another usual practice is to use the unconfined compressive strength measurements to calculate the tensile strength of rocks as typical rule of thumb, assuming that the tensile strength is 10% of the uniaxial compressive strength. Direct tensile strength measurements are far more unusual than confined compressive strength measurements; either because of sample availability constrains or because of the difficulties associated carrying out the tests (Nova and Zaninetti, 1990; Barla and Goffi, 1994). This study uses the Brazilian test introduced by Carneiro (1943) as an indirect testing technique to overcome the limitations associated to the direct tensile strength measurements.|","Document Type

O., Geophysics Institute| Kant, M. A., Institute of Process Engineering| Rudolf von Rohr, P., Institute of Process Engineering","|ABSTRACT: The applicability of a combined thermo-mechanical drilling technique is investigated. The working principle of this method is based on the implementation of a heat source as a mean to either provoke thermal spallation on the surface or to weaken the rock material, when spallation is not possible. Thermal spallation drilling has already been proven to work in hard crystalline rocks, however, several difficulties hamper its application for deep resource exploitation. In order to prove the effectiveness of a combined thermo-mechanical drilling method, the forces required to export the treated sandstone material with a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutter are analyzed. The main differences between oven and flame treatments are studied by comparing the resulting strength after heat-treating the samples up to temperatures of 650°C and for heating rates ranging from 0.17 °C/s to 20 °C/s. For moderate temperatures (300-450°C) the unconfined compressive strength after flame treatments monotonously decreased, opposed to the hardening behavior observed after oven treatments. Thermally induced intra-granular cracking and oxidation patterns served as an estimation of the treated depth due to the flame heat treatment. Therefore, conclusions on preferred operating conditions of the drilling system are drawn based on the experimental results.
1. INTRODUCTION
The exploitation of hydrocarbons and deep geothermal resources relies on finding cost-effective solutions to increase the drilling performance in hard crystalline rocks (Gill, 1983, Bejerano et al., 2006). Conventional rotary drilling techniques, based on mechanical rock abrasion and exportation, result in high rates of drilling tool wearing, causing significant costs (Fay, 1993, Pessier et al., 1992). Additionally, rotary drilling is characterized by low drilling speeds in hard crystalline basement rocks targeted for enhanced geothermal energy utilization. Further, even lower overall drilling rates result when considering tripping times required to exchange worn drill tools. Therefore, alternative drilling methods, such as hammering (Han et al., 2005, Teodoriu, 2011), thermal spallation (Rudolf von Rohr, 2015), electro-pulse (Anders et al., 2015), plasma drilling (Timoshkin et al., 2003, Kocis et al., 2015), and hydraulic jetting processes (Pekarek et al., 1963) are investigated worldwide in order to enhance the drilling capabilities for exploration of deep geological resources.|","Document Type

Examples of such projects include Delaware Dam, modified in 1993 for a stability deficiency, and Bluestone Dam, which is currently being modified for stability and hydrologic deficiencies. The risk assessment requires selection of upper and lower bounds and expected values of bedrock shear strength parameters representative of all potential sliding failure planes. Because of improvements in laboratory testing equipment and changes in analysis methodology over the past approximately thirty years, older data from direct shear testing of intact rock specimens used for analysis with the shear friction method was discarded and new testing programs were conducted to estimate shear strength parameters for analysis by limit equilibrium method. The shear strength parameters assigned to the structural wedge at both projects are represented by the sliding strength of a clean discontinuity. The basic phi angle can be obtained from testing data, but selection of an appropriate inclination angle (i-angle) is generally difficult. For Bluestone, site-specific first order i-angle measurements were made from excavations of foundation rock downstream of the dam toe. Selection of the first order i-angle for Delaware proved more challenging because site-specific first order i-angle measurements were not available. Instead, optical televiewer logs and data from direct shear tests of natural fractures were used to inform the selection. This paper explains the rationale used in selecting upper and lower bounds and expected shear strength parameters for the structural wedge of these two dams, and contrasts the methodology variations employed due to differing levels of available site data.
1. CHANGES IN STATE OF PRACTICE
In 2005, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers moved from a primarily standards-based approach for its dam safety program (Dam Safety Assurance Program, or DSA) to dam safety portfolio risk management. Implementation required risk assessments to be performed on all Corps dams, including those which had been previously evaluated under the DSA program with completed modifications such as Delaware Dam and projects that were undergoing modification like Bluestone Dam, to ensure that breach risk was reduced within USACE’s tolerable risk guidelines. The risk assessment requires (among other parameters) upper and lower bounds of shear strength parameters as well as expected values that are representative of all identified potential failure planes.|","Document Type

J., National Energy Technology Laboratory| Crandall, D., National Energy Technology Laboratory| Moore, J. E., National Energy Technology Laboratory","|ABSTRACT: Leaky wells are expensive to plug, provide a potential pathway for subsurface fluid migration, and are difficult to study in the field. Because of the inherent cost and risk associated with researching well integrity at the field-scale, a novel approach is being developed to increase our understanding of cement failure within the well system. This paper presents the approach, which combines a scaled experimental technique with an analytic model to rapidly and repeatedly simulate conditions that lead to failure in the well system. The experimental approach consists of a loading apparatus that can apply confining loads and internal “casing” pressures independently to a scaled-down (< 50 mm) model of a complete well system. The apparatus is contained in an industrial X-Ray CT scanner, which is capable of collecting 3D scans while loads are applied to the scaled well system. The ability to collect 2D radiographs, pressure data, and CT scans on the model well system during loading provides a unique and valuable means of performing destructive testing with non-invasive, in-situ imaging. For this study, the internal casing pressure was increased by 3.45 MPa (500 psi) increments until failure was observed in the form of radial cracks within the cement.
1. INTRODUCTION
Preventing the vertical flow of formation fluids is necessary for maintaining an efficient, cost-effective well operation free of negative environmental impacts. Primary well cementing—the act of filling the annulus between the casing and the formation with cement—is done with the aim of providing long-term, durable zonal isolation. The shift toward focusing on the cement annulus as a potential leakage pathway was relatively recent considering the age of the oil and gas industry. For decades after the first well was cemented, the sole strength parameter considered was the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of the set cement (Ravi et al., 2002). UCS was a primary design parameter because of its relation to many strength criterion, but also because it, along with cement setting time, are important factors for scheduling drilling.|","Document Type

D., University of New Mexico| Bauer, S. J., Sandia National Laboratories","|ABSTRACT: Gas permeability measurements have been made on granular samples during consolidation under hydrostatic stresses up to 40 MPa and temperatures up to 250 °C. The initial porosity of the samples prior to consolidation was as great as 0.40; depending on the test conditions and duration, the resulting final porosity was between 0.08 and less than 0.01. Although these tests were conducted at different temperatures, pressures, durations and salt types, a similar reduction in permeability was observed. The permeability steadily decreased from the initial relatively large value around 10<U+2212>14 m2 until after some critical porosity is reached (between 0.02 to 0.05); below the critical porosity, the permeability decreased at an increased rate. This response is attributed to loss of pore connectivity within the consolidating salt sample. The data suggest a very low porosity will have to be reached before the permeability of consolidating granular salt will be comparable to intact salt for conditions considered here.
1. INTRODUCTION
Granular (or crushed) salt is being considered as a seal material for shafts, drifts, and boreholes associated with mined nuclear waste repositories in salt. The eventual consolidation of granular salt in a repository to a condition comparable to intact salt would encase stored waste in an impermeable material and effectively erase penetrations through the salt formation. In this way, long-term isolation would rely only upon the characteristics of a massive salt deposit rather than maintaining an effective seal between dissimilar materials for thousands of years. Because the premise of using granular salt is that it will eventually achieve a permeability equivalent to intact salt, it is critical to understand how its permeability will change during consolidation.
Permeability measurements have been made on granular salt by numerous researchers, including Case et al. (1987), Holcomb and Shields (1987), Brodsky (1994), Cinar et al. (1996), Spangenberg et al. (1998), Bechtold et al. (2004), Salzer et al. (2007), and Stuhrenberg and Schulze (2012). The measurements have been made on samples with wide range of grain size distributions that have been consolidated under a variety of stress states and moisture conditions to varying porosities. Permeability measurements have principally been determined with the use of gas, but some measurements have been made with nonreactive liquids in addition to brine.|","Document Type

The analysis applies recently developed Bayesian nonlinear regression models to small sample sizes (n = 9, 12 and 15) drawn from an extensive published data set to obtain Hoek-Brown strength parameters. The results show how the uncertainty in parameter estimations, particularly the correlation between estimated m and <U+03C3>c are affected by the data combination. The paper further discusses how using a combination of three data types could result in significant reduction of uncertainties associated with strength parameter estimations, and concludes with suggestions for allocation of resources to different types of laboratory testing.
1. INTRODUCTION
The introduction of geotechnical limit states design (LSD) standards such as the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) (CSA, 2006) and EN-1997 (CEN, 2004) requires the basic philosophy of rock engineering design to change from that of traditional safety factors to the more rational reliability-based design (RBD) (e.g. Lemaire, 2006). A key element of RBD is robust statistical characterization of design parameters (e.g. MacGregor, 1976; CEN, 2002; Gulvanessian et al, 2002, Lemaire, 2006).
In rock engineering, strength of intact rock is a fundamental design parameter, and is often presented in terms of the well-known empirical HB criterion. However, for the most part, the uncertainties associated with both the fitted criterion and strength predictions based on it have historically been ignored. One aspect of fitting the HB criterion to strength data that has received much attention is that of combining compressive and tensile strength data (e.g. Zuo et al., 2008; Sari, 2010; Cai, 2010; Read and Richards, 2011; Sari, 2012; Langford and Diederichs 2015). One recent report exists that addresses both of these issues (Langford & Diederichs 2015).|","Document Type

In order to carry on such projects, it is essential to know the strength and deformability of rocks, as well as their in situ stress state. In Petroleum Engineering, especially, obtaining rock samples from a well and carrying out lab mechanical tests is costly and time consuming. Thus, petroleum engineers have been attempting to determine rock mechanical properties through index tests or log-based correlations as to expedite this process and reduce the global cost of the activity. Besides a comprehensive literature review regarding empirical correlations for predicting rock mechanical properties, this article presents results of uniaxial and scratch tests on a highly heterogeneous limestone sample from offshore wells in Brazil. By comparing UCS results of uniaxial and scratch tests, it was possible to validate the outcomes of the scratch tests. UCS scratch test profile presents a high resolution, in the present work this profile was averaged over intervals around each plug of conventional core analysis. Finally, UCS and Young Modulus empirical correlations for limestones are proposed. Using those correlation one can estimate UCS and static Young Modulus of limestones from their porosities and speed up the MEM assemblage.
1. INTRODUCTION
The assemblage of a Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) encompasses data gathering and analysis of information regarding in situ stress state, rock properties and underground geometry. An MEM can be seen as a bridge over the gap between Earth Science and Engineering Disciplines. The assemblage of an MEM is, intrinsically, a multidisciplinary task and a team with geologist, geophysicists and engineers must be formed in order to create such models.
A wide range of structural analysis during drilling, completion and production phases can be performed after the MEM assemblage. In reality, an MEM should be used even after the field abandonment, in order to ensure zonal isolation beyond the production lifetime of a reservoir. Depending on local rules, the wellbore seal must last many years beyond the well’s production lifespan. By performing a post-mortem structural analysis of a reservoir, wellbore failure can be predicted and mitigated, avoiding environmental and safety problems.|","Document Type

The effect of fluid leak-off into the formation matrix is incorporated using Carter’s model. Various injection profiles from wellbore to natural fracture are accounted for by modeling both radial and linear flow for fluid invasion within the fractures. A finite difference scheme is employed to predict the invasion of the drilling fluid into the fracture. The results of the numerical solution were validated using well-known analytical solution for the mud invasion problem. Several parametric studies were conducted to demonstrate the effect of fluid leak-off and fracture width on the fluid invasion depth and mud loss volume for both radial and linear flow cases. The obtained results indicate that the fluid leak-off reduces the rate of fluid invasion within the fracture. However, it does not affect the maximum depth of the fluid invasion over long time periods. It is shown that the mud loss volume may be significantly varied using different flow types (radial or linear) and leak-off coefficients. The results of the theoretical model are also compared - and found to be in excellent agreement - with the field data of a drilling mud loss incident. It is shown that consideration of fluid leak-off effect can significantly improve the accuracy of the mud loss prediction, and thereby results in a more realistic characterization of naturally fractured reservoirs.
1. INTRODUCTION
Accurate characterization of natural fractures is of crucial importance for well construction and reservoir stimulation. A reliable estimate of the natural fracture size is essential for the design of remedial mud loss treatments (Razavi et al., 2015, 2016, and 2017). Also, the knowledge of pre-existing natural fracture properties can significantly improve the application of hydraulic fracturing treatments and enhance the overall productivity of the reservoir (Olson et al., 2009, Bahorich et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2015 and 2016).|","Document Type

Three different modes were identified in the past for such failures: local shear, general shear and punching. While existence of these different failure modes is reasonably well known, in-situ test data describing the conditions under which the failure modes develop is scarce. In this paper, results from a large in-situ plate testing program conducted in some mines of the Illinois Basin are presented. The modes of floor failure at the plate test sites are examined with a goal to understand the conditions leading to each type of failure. Field observations at the test sites confirm existence of the three modes of floor failure. However, it was discovered that the response of floor depended on the nature of loading applied and the moisture content of the floor. Data is also presented on the load bearing capacity of the floor as determined by in-situ plate tests. The 132 different plate tests from 17 coal mines form the largest database of its kind for the Illinois Basin mines, which helped develop new strength relationships for use with pillar design.
1. INTRODUCTION
All major mineable coal seams in the Illinois Basin contain weak immediate floor materials. When stressed to the limit state, the floor response is normally manifested by large plastic movements that appear in the mine opening called ‘floor heave’. The limit state could be reached due to excess mining induced stresses, or significant increase in the moisture content or both. Floor heave can cause both short- and long-term problems. Depending on the location, in the short-term, the unstable floor movements may result in inaccessible work areas, unavailability of escape ways, reduced ventilation, roof falls and increased operational cost. In the long-term, floor failure is the main reason for unplanned surface subsidence in a majority of cases in the Illinois Basin. Excess deformation of floor in the long-term can also affect the integrity of mine seals used to isolate working sections from abandoned areas. For both the short- and long-term cases, normally the surface will not be affected unless the underground instability occurs over a reasonably large area. If floor heave occurs in a single entry or in a few isolated spots in a panel, such instability may not cause noticeable damage to the surface. The size of the unstable area needed to induce visible surface damage principally depends on depth of cover, width of the panel, nature of materials in the overburden, and the amount by which coal pillars settled.|","Document Type

Special attention is given to the contact region between the cutter and the rock. Frictional contact is solved using a Gap Based Augmented Lagrangian approach, in order to minimize the interpenetration error that is present in the less expensive penalty approach, while reducing finite element accumulation time compared to the standard Lagrangian method. Numerical experiments are performed with a single cylindrical cutter of radius 16 mm, a back rake of 15°, a depth of cut of 4 mm, and two different chamfers: a 0.3 mm chamfer at 15°, and a 0.5 mm chamfer at 45°. The number of Uzawa iterations required for the interpenetration error to have minimal impact on cutting forces is estimated, and the accuracy of the penalty approach is emphasized. Contact tractions are shown, suggesting areas where the mesh should be refined. A suitable mesh size is given for both chamfer geometries. The influence of the friction coefficient on cutting forces is evaluated, suggesting a cutter configuration insensitive to the value of the friction coefficient within a realistic range.
1. INTRODUCTION
Many attempts have been made to numerically model rock cutting. The different approaches used include the boundary element method [Tan et al 1998; Liu 2002], the finite element method (FEM) [Jaime et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2014], the discrete element method [Huang, 1999; Rojek et al., 2011] and the discrete-finite element method [Onate and Rojek, 2004]. Huang [1999] showed the potential of the discrete element method to explain the reduction of the interfacial friction coefficient up to a critical back rake angle, due to the flow of material on the cutter face. Rojek et al. [2011] predicted cutter forces and chip size, for a point attack pick at 1.4 m/s and 10 mm depth of cut, and showed that these can be correlated to the frequency spectrum of cutting forces. Onate and Rojek [2004] modeled the tool considering thermo-mechanical effects on model cutter wear. Helmons and Miedema [2013] considered flow between the discrete spherical elements. However, discrete models require non-conservative numerical damping parameters to dissipate kinetic energy, and extensive calibration in order to macroscopically represent material behavior. Guo et al. [1992] used the finite element method (FEM) and assumed a pre-existing crack, but did not account for the crushed zone in front of the cutter. Jaime et al. [2010] showed FEM to be accurate for rock cutting, considered several chipping cycles, and solved for contact between the cutter and an irregular rock surface. These authors used a plastic cap model included in a plastic-damage model implemented in the commercial software LS- DYNA. Damaged elements beyond a certain threshold were removed, leading to unrealistic force drops.|","Document Type

Studies of injuries and fatalities caused by rib falls have shown that the significant mining conditions that contribute to rib falls are mining height, depth of cover, and stress resulting from mining of multiple seams. In longwall mining, rib stability in gate entries is also influenced by the induced abutment pressures. To reduce the risk of rib injuries and fatalities in longwall mining, it is important to understand the mechanisms of rib failure under different geologic and mining conditions, and the requirements for rib support in the gate entries. Rib scoping was performed by NIOSH researchers to detect fractures in the ribs of the gate entries in the Pittsburgh coal seam. Rib fractures and failures were observed for various loading conditions throughout different mining cycles. Numerical modeling was performed to calibrate a coal mass model to the field data and to further predict rib fractures under different abutment stress levels. Based on field monitoring and numerical modeling, a conceptual model is proposed for considerations of rib support in longwall gate entries.
1. INTRODUCTION
In the past several decades, the installation of roof support in underground coal mines has been a priority in preventing potential roof falls as entries and crosscuts are developed. Conversely, rib support has not been taken as seriously as roof support in the past, especially under the conditions where rib sloughage is not so pronounced. Although the scale of rib falls is usually smaller compared to the scale of roof falls, a chunk of coal or rock falling from rib could be a potential risk of injury. The current practice in coal mines in the United States is to choose rib bolts of specific diameter and length as a reactive action; that is, the rib bolting is designed in response to the scale of rib falls and injuries that have occurred (Mohamed et al., 2015). In some cases, whether or not to implement rib support can be easily determined through observations of rib sloughage, while in other cases, the rib may be over-supported or undersupported based on what is perceived through observations. Rib stability is primarily influenced by entry height, overburden depth, and stress resulting from mining of multiple seams. In longwall gate entries, rib stability is also affected by the induced abutment pressures created by longwall retreating.|","Document Type

A., OilField Geomechanics LLC","|ABSTRACT: Stress Shadows, the colloquial term used to describe the stress field change associated with hydraulic fractures, is a fundamental part of hydraulic fracture optimization in horizontal wells. The authors, and others, have written extensively about Stress Shadows and their potential influence on breakdown pressures, ISIP increases from toe to heal in horizontal wellbores, on hydraulic fracture rotation and asymmetric propagation, on perforation cluster efficiency, and on their potential impact on multi-well completion schemes. However, as many of the current Unconventional Plays, like those in the Permian Basin in Texas, in the STACK/SCOOP in Oklahoma, and the Bakken in North Dakota, involve sufficient vertical thickness that stacked laterals are being used or considered, the impact of Stress Shadows needs to also be considered for these developments.
Within this paper, the authors present numerical hydraulic fracture simulation results for a Bakken-type stacked play considering the impact of Stress Shadows on fracture propagation (both height and length) as well as fracture rotation. The results show that, under certain field conditions, there may be a benefit to optimizing lateral landing location, job design, and the vertical completion sequencing of the laterals (i.e., stimulating from shallow to deep rather than deep to shallow).
1. INTRODUCTION
The authors, and others (Nagel, et al., 2011; Nagel, et al., 2013 a; Nagel, et al., 2013b; Wong, et al., 2013; Peirce and Bunger, 2014; Dohmen, et al., 2015; Skomorowski, et al., 2015; and Zangeneh, et al., 2015), have written fairly extensively about Stress Shadows - the colloquial or common term used to describe the stress changes induced by hydraulic fractures. Furthermore, the topic of Stress Shadows has been included in a patent application (Patent WO2015069817A1, 2015) and as a Society of Petroleum Engineers Distinguished Lecturer topic (Nagel, 2016).
In an elastic formation, stress and deformation are coupled. That is, if the formation is stressed, it will deform and if the formation is deformed, it will alter the local stress field. This concept was known and applied to a crack (i.e., a hydraulic fracture) in an elastic medium by Sneddon (1946). This points to one of several key understandings about Stress Shadows: Stress Shadows are a result of hydraulic fracture-induced deformations (e.g., hydraulic fracture width or natural fracture width) and any temporal changes in these deformations (e.g., closure of the hydraulic fracture on proppant) will alter the Stress Shadows. Furthermore, this means that Stress Shadows occur from all hydraulic fractures, whether initiated from a horizontal or a vertical wellbore.|","Document Type

R., University of Texas| Flemings, P. B., University of Texas","|ABSTRACT: We study the effects of a highly permeable sand layer on pore pressure and stresses near a salt diapir by using a forward hydro-mechanical finite-element model. We compare a salt basin entirely composed of mudrocks to the same basin but with a highly permeable sand layer across its bottom. We show that the sand layer causes a significant increase in pore pressure near the diapir by transmitting overpressure from deep sediments far from the diapir. This pressure increase makes it difficult to safely drill wellbores near the diapir. We examine the stress history of mudrocks at the crest of the sand layer and show that the pore pressure increase near diapir causes unloading of sediments, which is a crucial finding for seismic prediction of pore pressure in these sediments. Overall, our results offer an insight into the effects of basin sand layers on pore pressure distribution, seismic pore pressure prediction, and wellbore design near salt diapirs.
1. INTRODUCTION
Many hydrocarbon reservoirs are trapped against salt diapirs. The stability and safety of wellbores drilled to produce from these reservoirs are controlled by the pore pressure and stress state near diapirs. Inverse, reverse, and forward modeling are approaches that are typically used to predict pore pressure and stresses. The first two methods predict pore pressure and stresses for the present geometry of the salt system. However, they are based on assumptions that may not be valid, particularly near salt diapirs and sand layers in the basin. Forward modeling may not fully honor the present geometry of a system but, because it does not make assumptions, its predictions can be used to evaluate the assumptions made in the first two methods.
Seismic methods are well-known inverse methods for pore pressure prediction in basins. These methods predict the present magnitudes of pore pressure and stresses based on seismic velocity of sediments measured across the basin. The predictions of these methods, however, depend highly on the loading/unloading status of sediments, that is, whether the sediment present stresses are the maximum stresses ever experienced by the sediments. This status is particularly unclear for sediments at the crest of sand layers near a salt diapir. Because the permeability of sand layers is orders of magnitude higher than the permeability of mudrocks, they behave as conduits and transmit significant overpressure generated in deep sediments far from the salt diapir to shallow sediments at the crest of the sand layer near the diapir. The transmitted overpressure can be high enough to cause unloading of the crest sediments. Because seismic methods predict only the present pore pressure and stresses, they are unable to determine and hence assume this status. Furthermore, seismic methods can predict pore pressure only in mudrocks; they are unable to predict pore pressure in embedded lithologies such as sandstone or carbonate layers. Because of their significantly different permeability, considerably different pore pressures can develop in these layers and their adjacent mudrocks over the basin evolution (Dickinson, 1953, Traugott, 1997 and Bowers, 2001). Seismic methods often assume that pore pressure in these lithologies equals pore pressure in adjacent mudrocks.|","Document Type

L., Louisiana State University","|ABSTRACT: Different from the prevalent methods that treat rock formation as isotropic elastic, poroelastic, and/or elastoplastic materials, this paper presents a set of semi-analytical solutions for the wellbore stability problem by adopting the widely used anisotropic critical state plasticity model originally proposed by Dafalias, 1987. This model is capable of taking mechanical anisotropy into account and therefore the wellbore stability analysis presented in this paper is more realistic. By carefully choosing an independent auxiliary variable, the plastic zone solution is reduced to solving a system of seven partial differential equations with the three stress components, specific volume, and three anisotropic hardening parameters being the basic unknowns. Parametric studies have been conducted to explore the influence of overconsolidation ratio and inherent anisotropy. The results show that both these two plasticity features exert pronounced effects on the response of the drilled wellbore. In addition, the feature of anisotropy has also been discussed. It is found that there is a distinct difference between the results with and without considering the anisotropy in the wellbore stability problem.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wellbore stability has long been recognized as one of the main issues in petroleum engineering because of its great importance in successful production of oil and gas. Currently, solution to this problem is sought mainly through numerical method (Muller et al., 2009; Veeken et al., 1989) instead of analytical approach, largely due to the great complexities involved in the derivation of closed-form solutions. This is particularly the case when complicated constitutive model is adopted to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rock formations during wellbore drilling.
Probably because of the complexities mentioned above, few studies have been conducted analytically to analyze wellbore drilling problem, and almost all the existing analytical solutions have generally been presented in an approximate manner. Graziani and Ribacchi (1993) proposed an analytical approach to determine the state of stress and strain for a circular opening excavated in a rock mass, where the rock is assumed to obey the nonassociated strain softening Mohr-Coulomb model with the softening behavior linked to a simple plastic shear strain through the so-called softening modulus parameter. Charlez and Roatesi (1999) derived an analytical solution for the wellbore stability problem under undrained condition using a simplistic Cam Clay model where the elliptical yield surface was replaced by two straight lines, and the solution is restricted to the volumetric strain hardening rocks with overconsolidation ratio less than two. It should be mentioned that in the recent work by Chen and Abousleiman (2016), a set of rigorous semi-analytical solutions were obtained for undrained and drained problems of cylindrical cavity contraction using bounding surface plasticity model, which made no approximations in the derivation of the closed-form solutions.|","Document Type

B., Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro","|ABSTRACT: The production of a petroleum reservoir is a coupled process between stress variation and fluid flow phenomena, which affects the reservoir and its surrounding rocks. This study aims to assess production and geomechanical aspects of an oil field located in Campos Basin - Brazil, called Field B, by different hydromechanical coupling schemes. In this work, one-way and two-way coupled hydromechanical simulations were carried out by using a methodology developed by the research group GTEP/PUC-Rio, which enables to run coupled hydromechanical simulations between a commercial black-oil simulator and an inhouse, stress analysis software (CHRONOS). Two sets of coupling parameters were used to introduce the geomechanical effects in the reservoir simulation on the two-way coupling. The first set is constituted by porous compressibility and porosity. Furthermore, the second was constituted by porous compressibility, porosity and absolute permeability. Then, flow and geomechanical results were compared. In this particular scenario, the results of the two-way simulation that used the first set of coupling parameters were similar to the one-way coupling. On other hand, diverged significantly from the second, mainly by the predicted oil production rate. Therefore, in this case, neglecting permeability reduction due to depletion can lead to significant errors.
1. INTRODUCTION
The production of a hydrocarbon reservoir changes the original in-situ stress condition of a petroleum field, which affects the reservoir and its surrounding rocks equilibrium. As a response to that, there are deformations that change the porosity and absolute permeability of the reservoir. The pore pressure and the production are influenced by these changes. Therefore, the development of a reservoir is a coupled process between flow and geomechanics, that is, a hydromechanical coupling phenomenon (WANG, 2000).
Some reservoirs are more sensitive to this coupling process because there are rocks very deformable due to stress variations caused by pore pressure changes. These deformations have a high impact on its porosity and especially on its permeability.|","Document Type

J., Sandia Naitonal Laboratory","|ABSTRACT: Results from three compressive creep tests on dried crushed salt, focused on identifying the influence of pore pressure during reconsolidation, are presented. All tests were completed under a macroscopic hydrostatic confining pressure of 30 MPa while the internal pore pressure varied from zero to 20 MPa across the tests. All tests were held under constant creep conditions for approximately 24 hours at an elevated temperature of 170°C, and isotropic volumetric plastic deformations were observed as the sample porosities decreased by over 3%. Plastic volumetric strain rates during the creep tests varied from 3 • 10–5 down to 4 • 10– 8sec –1, and the combined results from these tests indicate the volumetric deformations of a crushed-salt sample under creep conditions is influenced by the application of pore pressure within a bulk sample.
1. INTRODUCTION
Deformation of crushed salt is of interest to both the mining and waste repository industries because crushed salt could economically be used as a backfill and sealing material in these environments. However, the design for backfilling a drift in a salt mine along with the sealing of a room or borehole of a waste repository all depend upon understanding crushed-salt's constitutive properties, i.e., the relationship between stress and strain over a bulk volume of crushed salt. The constitutive response of crushed salt is nonlinear, as its response varies greatly with bulk porosity and is heavily influence by water content, particle size, and temperature. To date, numerous models have been developed in a continuing effort to accurately describe crushed salt's constitutive properties (Butcher, 1980; Sjaardema and Krieg, 1987; Holcomb and Zeuch, 1990; Zeuch, 1990; Spiers and Brzesowsky, 1993; Callahan et al., 1998; Olivella and Gens, 2002; Krohn et al., 2015). These existing constitutive models have been developed based on a wide range of approaches that aim to reproduce the characteristics observed during laboratory experiments.|","Document Type

The; upper portion of the kimberlite pipe has been exploited by traditional open pit mining method and currently mining continues underground beneath open pit with a vertical glory hole extending down to the active underground mining levels. Underground mining adopts sub-level retreat (SLR) methods. The objective of this study is to assess the stability of the open pit as underground mining progresses. The influence of uncertainties in two key input parameters, the in-situ stress field and groundwater pressures, was evaluated using a three dimensional Distinct Element Method software 3DEC. A hydrogeological model has been developed to evaluate groundwater pressures and flows at the mine site. In-situ stress testing has been carried out to confirm a historical in-situ stress field based on the understanding of the tectonic history and geological settings. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out to determine the influence of these two key parameters on the stability of an identified critical wedge in the pit wall. The potential impact of groundwater depressurization on stability of the identified critical wedge is also evaluated. |1. INTRODUCTION |In strong, brittle and massive rock, the failure mechanism is dominantly governed by the strength and orientation of geological structures.

A series of triaxial single-stage creep tests was performed on Marcellus shale. The specimens were cored parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane. X-ray diffraction tests were performed to determine the mineralogical composition of shale. The tests showed that the specimens were rich in carbonate content with minor percentage of clay minerals. A suite of uniaxial and triaxial compressive tests was performed on both parallel and perpendicular that determined their strength in different confining conditions. Finally, triaxial creep tests were performed to estimate the strength variation with orientation. Results from X-ray Diffraction (XRD), uniaxial and triaxial tested specimen showed the brittle behavior of shale. Specimens cored parallel to the bedding plane was found to be stiffer than the perpendicular specimens at different confining stresses. Higher confining stress led to the failure of specimens at higher angle of major shear failure plane to major principal stress. This was accompanied with lesser number of axial cracks and increase in the deformation of the specimen. Value of creep strain rate was found to be in correlation with differential stress on horizontal and vertical specimens.
1. INTRODUCTION
The fundamental behavior of long-term strength deterioration in shale rock is not known. Various rock engineering structures such as underground coalmines have operating life of 30 years or greater and the challenge to maintain a stable roof is prime concern of ground control researchers. Mine Health and Safety Administration’s (MSHA) reports show that roof fall and rib rolls are the leading fatality factors. Operators have also left rider coal in the roof to prevent exposure of shale roof from humid mine environment. The approach has reduced the occurrence of roof failure however, long-term deformation of roof rock constituted with shale is still lacking.

This paper presents the results of an experimental study using a laboratory hydraulic fracturing setup, in which the injection rate was varied across four experiments, and the fracturing process was observed visually as well as with acoustic emission sensors. Prismatic 2 <U+00D7> 4 <U+00D7> 1 in. specimens of Opalinus clay shale, with a pre-cut 0.33 in. width flaw, were subjected to hydraulic pressure under constant biaxial far-field loading conditions. The pressure was measured internally inside the flaw as well as at the pressure volume actuator. Both a high speed- and a high resolution camera were used to visually record changes on the face of the specimen (i.e. fracturing). Acoustic emissions were recorded with an array of eight piezoceramic sensors embedded in specialized platens. The results of the experiments were then used in an analysis of the peak pressures and fracture propagation speed related to the injection rate. Higher peak pressures, fracturing speeds and fracturing accelerations were observed with higher injection rates. Additionally, the spectral analysis of the largest AE events showed that the highest injection rates resulted in higher power at lower frequencies. The highest injection rate was also associated with greater AE activity in general.
1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
For hydraulic fracturing operations in the field, the pumping rate is generally controlled but it is not fully understood how this affects the resulting fracture processes. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of experimental studies being conducted on hydraulic fracturing in the laboratory. Experiments on natural rock typically use external displacement measurements, acoustic emission observation and post-failure inspection often combined with resin to capture the fracturing behavior during hydraulic fracture (Casas et al., 2006; Lecampion et al., 2015; Stanchitis et al., 2015a; Stanchitis et al., 2015b). Other researchers have used transparent model material, such as PMMA, to visualize the fractures (Rubin, 1984; Bunger et al., 2005; Lecampion et al., 2015). Visualizing the fractures in a natural rock, in real-time while applying confining pressures, has been difficult to achieve in the laboratory.|","Document Type

A clip gage clips onto the specimen at distinct reference points and integrates the observed straining over a reference (gage) length. Since the clip gages are installed in-vessel and are subjected to the same confining pressure variations of the test procedure, their elastic response and other sensor element related deviations mask the displacement readouts. This paper proposes a model to compensate these effects in the test registers that can be implemented in the test machine controller, so that any controller action might benefit from real strain measures. The model consider each clip gage element separately to account for its mechanics. It includes a jacket (membrane) model to account for its effects on the circumferential strain readings. A procedure to evaluate the clip gage parameters is presented, as well as a fit example. The final model is versatile, as it may be applied to any test setup using a single set of clip gage parameters. |1. INTRODUCTION |Conventional triaxial tests on rock specimens require their immersion in a confining chamber, namely the triaxial cell. The confining pressure is exerted on the specimen walls by a confining fluid at the desired pressure level. Once the confining chamber is closed, direct access to the specimen being tested is lost and the information is transmitted to the testing machine controller via telemetry. |Testing information, such as test temperature, axial force, confining pressure and specimen strains, for instance, are preferably measured inside the triaxial cell and close to the specimen for better accuracy. The accessories intended to measure these testing variables are hence subjected to the same pressure variations of the testing program and may therefore be affected by them. Triaxial tests may also require the specimen to be enveloped by an impervious membrane or jacket to isolate the porespace from the confining chamber fluid. This jacket prevents direct mechanical contact of some accessories to the specimen walls, thus incorporating its mechanical response in the final measurements.|","Document Type

I., ESG Solutions| Bosman, K., ESG Solutions","|ABSTRACT: In order to understand how the rock mass evolves with extraction in the particularly highly-stressed environment of a sill pillar in a hard rock mine in North America, we investigate the utility of seismic tomography as an interpretive tool. We use a rich dataset of blasts to highlight the compressional wave variations in the rock. Although tough there are areas within the sill pillar that are prone to smearing, we are able to resolve subtle variations in velocity structure. By considering different time periods, we image temporal changes in seismic velocity that we relate to the stress state and damage in the rock. Specifically, we consider data recorded during three sequential time intervals associated with the excavation of a stope during the start of the second interval. We observe a high-velocity anomaly in the first interval that is located to the edge of the future stope. After mining, the high-velocity regions migrate to the other side of the stope and then disperse to the edges of the resolvable area. Equating high-velocity anomalies with high-stress gives us the ability to characterize the evolving stress state in the mine and potentially an approach that can be used to avoid hazardous situations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Underground excavations in mines entail a detailed understanding of the stress state to mitigate the risk of rockbursts and other seismicity that may cause damage to infrastructure and potentially casualties to personnel. Depending on the overall mining methodology, the highly-stressed areas become more focused in sill and crown pillars. As a mine reaches the end of its life-cycle, the need to safely excavate these areas becomes critical, and techniques that constrain the stress state are essential to enable the safe extraction of the resource.
The rock mass responds to variations in the stress state of the mine; high-stress areas have the effect of closing microcracks in the rock mass and, thereby, increasing seismic velocities. By mapping the velocity variations as a function of space and time we can start to understand the stress variations associated with extraction. Tomographic imaging of mines has been used to relate to the stress distribution in mines in several studies (e.g. Young & Maxwell 1992; Maxwell & Young 1996; Silver et al. 2007; Ma et al. 2016). A number of studies have shown promise in using these techniques to monitor the stability of block caving operations (Westman et al. 2012; Mercier et al. 2015).|","Document Type

P., Northwestern University| Kouretzis, G. P., The University of Newcastle","|ABSTRACT: Accurately assessing the forces and reactions on cylindrical objects partially embedded in soils is fundamental in pipeline engineering as well as the analysis and design of off-road vehicles. With a view towards understanding the limiting forces acting over the contact area between the cylinder and the soil, this paper compares two different theoretical approaches for predicting ultimate loads under combined vertical and horizontal loading. The first is an approximate method based on idealizing the contact interface as a flat shallow strip footing, and the second is based on finite element limit analysis (FELA). Focus is on purely frictional material and plane strain conditions, assuming a rigid cylinder and perfectly plastic material obeying the Mohr-Coulomb yield condition with associated plastic flow. The approximate method based on an analogy to an equivalent shallow foundation (with no overburden) predicts results that are reasonably close to those from FELA but only when small embedment is considered. Moreover, the discrepancy between the two approaches for the case of free cylinder rotation is attributed to the existence of a contact moment over the soil-cylinder contact interface. Practical implications for pipeline engineering and off-road vehicle engineering are discussed.
1. INTRODUCTION
The evaluation of ultimate contact force between partially embedded (on-bottom) cylindrical structures and soil is a fundamental problem for applications in various branches of engineering, from assessing the stability of offshore pipelines (Small, 1971; Gao et al. 2015) to determining the forces on wheeled vehicles operating on soils (Collins, 1972; Hambleton and Stanier, 2017). For instance, soil resistance against lateral buckling of pipelines is critical for the design of oil pipelines which can buckle due to thermal expansion, mechanical actions or geo-hazards. Accurately predicting resistance not only creates economic benefits but also prevents potentially significant impacts on the environment resulting from oil leakage (Oliveira et al. 2010).
A literature review shows that various approaches have been proposed to assess the ultimate (limit) loads on partially embedded cylinders. Based on limit analysis, Murff et al. (1989) derived upper bound and lower bound solutions for the ultimate vertical load acting on a pipeline embedded in perfectly plastic cohesive material. Using the upper bound approach of limit analysis, Randolph and Houlsby (1984) and Martin and Randolph (2006) studied the capacity of a pile against lateral loading in perfectly plastic cohesive soil, which can be used to analyze very deeply embedded pipelines whose bearing capacity is independent of the embedment depth and the loading direction. By idealizing soil as a perfectly plastic cohesive soil, Randolph and White (2008) proposed an upper bound solution to evaluate the bearing capacity of shallowly embedded pipelines subjected to combined vertical and horizontal loading. Their theoretical predictions were presented as V-H failure envelopes, where the variables V and H refer to the vertical and horizontal components of the ultimate load, respectively.|","Document Type

M., South Dakota School of Mines and Technology","|ABSTRACT: The kISMET experiment included drilling monitoring holes (50 m deep) and an injection hole (100 m deep) at the 4850 Level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, SD, USA. The core from two of the HQ-size monitoring holes was examined to determine petrologic, acoustic velocity, and magnetic susceptibility properties. The core was characterized as being a graphite carbonate phyllite with the carbonates being both calcite and dolomite. Regular variations with depth in the acoustic velocities were recognized and will provide information to inform the analysis of the hydraulic fracturing results.
1. Introduction
Field operations for the kISMET (Permeability [k] and Induced Seismicity Management for Energy) project were conducted in the underground of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) during the summer of 2016. Five holes were drilled at 3 m intervals on the 4850 Level of the facility in a drift that connects between the Yates Shaft and the Ross Shaft. The four HQ- size monitoring holes were drilled to a design depth of 50 m and the NQ-size injection hole was drilled to a design depth of 100 m (Fig. 1). The holes were designated as k-001 through k-005 with k-001 being the furthest to the north. This report is confined to geophysical results from k-001 and k-004. Hydraulic fracturing experiments were conducted in the middle (k-003) injection
2. Rock Description
Caddy and others (1991) estimated that the entire Poorman Fm. has a thickness of 1500 m, and Steadman and Large (2016) suggested that the metasedimentary rocks of the Ross Member have a thickness ranging from 200 – 1,000 m. Therefore, the present drilling only investigated a portion of the metasedimentary portion of the Poorman Fm. These metamorphosed sedimentary rocks are tightly folded, but in general the rock package plunges to the south in this area. The sequence consists primarily of graphite, carbonate phyllites. The rocks are rhythmically bedded with alternating sequences of more massive graphitic phyllites alternating with thin (< 2 cm) bands of carbonate, although some variation in the more graphitic units can be recognized as well based on subtle color changes. Figure 2 shows two thin-sections taken from core k-001 at 12.2 m and 42.7 m. The thin sections are colored with alizarin red staining agent, which is sensitive to the calcium content of the calcite. As a result, the locations of the calcite in the thin sections are well-defined by the staining. Although not visible in the sections of Figure 2 due to the small grain-size, the opaque graphite grains are typically less than 0.25 mm in diameter and are irregular in shape. Depending upon the graphite concentration, the rock varies in color from white in the thinly bedded carbonate units to black in the heavily graphitic units. The results of the hydraulic fracturing are being analyzed and reported elsewhere. This report deals with descriptions of the rock in which the fracturing was performed, the acoustic velocities measured on core recovered during the construction of the monitoring holes, and magnetic susceptibilities of the core. Figure 1 is adapted from Golder (2009) and shows the 4850 Level in the vicinity of the kISMET holes. The pertinent units in the figure include the Proterozoic rocks of the Yates unit of the Poorman Fm., the upper Poorman Fm., called the Ross Member by Steadman and Large (2016), and the Tertiary-age rhyolite dikes. Figure 1 also shows that the holes for the kISMET project were drilled in the upper unit of the Poorman Fm. above the contact with the amphibolite of the Yates member of the Poorman Formation. No rhyolite was intersected during this phase of the project.|","Document Type

P., Agapito Associates, Inc.| Zhao, Hua, Agapito Associates, Inc.","|ABSTRACT: Solution mining of a potash bed beneath a 40-m-thick salt bed at a depth of cover of 1100 m was planned for a potash project. Because each solution-mining cavern’s planned life was several years and due to salt creep, assuring casing integrity within the salt bed above the caverns was a major engineering challenge.
To assist in the design of the casing and slip joints, small-scale UCS and punch-through shear tests were performed on a variety of casing-cement samples. These tests were used to determine cohesive and frictional behaviors of the casing-cement bond. After testing, a numerical modeling study was performed to better understand and predict the behavior of the casing-cement bond. Numerical analyses included cavern-scale and casing-scale models at various resolutions.
The laboratory test results suggested that a weak casing-cement bond could be achieved by using relatively low-strength cement and greased, lubricated, or friction-reducing coated casings. Numerical analysis results showed that the weak casing-cement bond would prevent both high tensile and compressive stresses from forming in the casing. These analyses also demonstrated that slip joints were effective when used with the weak casing-cement bond. The cohesion and friction angle of the casing-cement bond and the location of slip joints were recommended based on the laboratory testing and model observations herein.
1. INTRODUCTION
Selective and non-selective solution mining of a potash bed was planned for a potash project, located at a depth of about 1100 meters (m) below ground and covered by an approximately 40-m-thick salt bed. The planned life for each solution-mining cavern was several years. Based on previous cavern stability, subsidence assessment, and wellfield and casing design studies for the project, it was noted that because of the long cavern life and due to salt creep, assuring casing integrity within the approximately 40-m-thick salts above the caverns was a major engineering challenge.|","Document Type

This is done by using the finite element method (FEM) on systems with different types of heterogeneity. We look at configurations with known analytical solutions, namely, laminate composites and demonstrate that our numerical formulation produces a reasonable match for multiple combinations of elastic properties. We show that the stress component transversal to the composite is homogeneous, while the longitudinal component is piecewise constant in agreement with the theoretical assumptions. Next, we consider a system subdivided in Nx times Ny regions and investigate two types of heterogeneity: continuous and discrete. The former consists of systems with parameters sampled from a continuous probability density function (pdf), while the latter correspond to systems with a finite number material types. For the first case, we use a uniform pdf for the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio and observed that the resulting distribution of effective moduli follow a strongly skewed distribution towards low values and, in addition, the distribution of local stresses is smeared out. In the case of a discrete distribution of properties, we consider a two-phase material with contrasting properties and distributed with a stiff background, and softer material distributed in isolated clusters. We observe that, in this case, the distribution of effective moduli follow a normal pdf while local stresses exhibit regions with extremely high values.
1. INTRODUCTION
Upscaling of flow parameters for reservoir flow simulation has been extensively studied [1, 2]. The reason for the interest lies on the fact that oil and gas reservoirs are usually very heterogeneous systems and, while computer power now allows the simulation of very large models [3], it is either impossible or impractical to represent details at all relevant scales.
Many methods have been suggested for the upscaling of flow parameters [4-7]. Most methods published to date, start with the assumption of a finite difference discretization and target the upscaling of transmissibilities. Alternative methods rely on the effective medium theory, which can only be applied to specific geometries [7].
Traditional approaches are based on analytical solutions, under the assumption of a specific connectivity and a given set of boundary conditions (local approximations). To remove these assumptions, global methods have been proposed [8] which involves the computation of a coarse representation that minimizes the global norm. A more practical approach, which in turn is more amenable for generalization, known as the global-local method has also been proposed [4].|","Document Type

In this study, uniaxial tests of brittle shale were conducted. Inclination induced by spherically/flatly seated upper loading platen was analyzed. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe the micro crack tip induced by the non-uniform loading. Taking the inclination of loading platen into consideration, Particle Flow Code 2D was used to simulate non-uniform loading process. Typical post-peak failure was analyzed allowing for load train stiffness and servo response interval, which played a role in the uncontrolled failure process. Conclusion shows that slight inclination of loading platen would lead to highly non-uniform loading. Stress-strain curve of brittle rock post-peak failure showed characteristics of load train stiffness and servo response interval. Conclusion also showed that the insensitivity of axial strain to splitting in UCS testing was the main reason for axial strain rate control mode to give unsatisfactorily control in brittle rock UCS testing. The study here could give a better understanding on rock compression testing and corresponding machine design.
1. INTRODUCTION
Complete stress-strain curve of brittle rock has been well studied in the past fifty year. In 1970s, plenty of uniaxial and triaxial experiments were conducted, servo system was also introduced to obtain better post-peak curve. Stress and strain curve was first separated into type I and type II in 1970 by Wawersik and Fairhurst1. The instrument they used was quite different from servo control machine we use nowadays, a stabilizing jack which was put parallel to rock specimen to sustain the load that could not be carried by rock specimen, and type II curve was obtained through this way. Wawersik5 used the method and instrument mentioned above to conduct uniaxial and triaxial rock test, microscopic observation was used and post-peak failure was also studied.|","Document Type

Ltd.","|ABSTRACT: Subjected to long-term mechanical and thermal loads, salt rocks where many Underground Gas Storages (UGS) are excavated usually demonstrate strong time-dependent creep behaviors. In this study, the micro-mechanisms of thermal effect on salt creep behavior is investigated in a discrete element method (DEM) based micro-mechanism system. A novel hybrid model is proposed to describe the thermal-mechanical-creep behavior. This model combines Burger’s model and linear parallel model at the contacts between particles. Creep behavior is described by Burger’s contact model, while thermal transfer is approached by linear parallel contact model via active thermal pipes. The validation of this DEM numerical model is verified by the laboratory creep test, and the model is capable of capturing the development of micro-fractures during creep test subjected to different temperatures. The results indicate that temperature make significant contributions to axial strain rate. The induced thermal cracks account for the higher creep strain rate with elevated temperature in micro-mechanism. Incorporation with creep experiments, the DEM modeling provides an alternative and promising method to explore the micro-mechanical response to temperature influence, can help us improve the understanding of creep behavior of salt rock in UGS during thermal loading.
1. INTRODUCTION
Salt rock in underground cavern is considered as an ideal rock material for natural gas storage due to its favorable creep properties of halite (Berest et al. 2001; Berest et al. 2007; Zhu and Arson 2014). Drilling and completing wells through salt formations leads to technical challenges, and high costs (Lao et al. 2012). Both of the situations are required to explore or resist long-term creep, induced by stress difference and temperature variation during operations.
It is very challenging to predict long-term behavior of rock salt, and many-year operational performance of the UGS (Berest and Brouard, 2003; Cole 2002). Therefore, numerous analytical creep models and experimental work have been conducted to study the creep behaviors, with many affecting factors such as loading rate, temperature, and other complicated in-situ conditions considered. Cristescu (1993) developed a general constitutive equation for transient and stationary creep pf rock salt, which can be used for varying stress states. Zhou et al. (2010) proposed a creep constitutive model on the basis of time-based fractional derivative to describe the nonlinear creep strain of salt rock. This model replaces a Newtonian dashpot in classical Nishihara model with the fractional derivative Abel dashpot; and the results predicted by this model were in better agreement with experimental data. In other studies, Sheinin and Blokhin (2012) and Wisetsaen et al. (2014) found that the elevated temperature decreases the tensile elastic modulus and increases the creep rate.|","Document Type

S., Spokane Mining Research Division","|ABSTRACT: In burst-prone mines, seismic monitoring is a central component of risk analysis and mitigation efforts. In order to maximize the effectiveness of such analyses, event magnitude and location errors should be minimized. However, minimizing location errors can be difficult due to unknowns in the geologic media through which the seismic energy propagates. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is conducting research to improve the quality of the event locations contained in a seismic catalog produced by a surface network monitoring a deep underground silver mine in northern Idaho. Travel times of several events with relatively well-known locations, as determined by an in-mine network, were modeled using the fast marching method. The Nelder-Mead simplex method was then employed, in conjunction with global Monte Carlo sampling, to determine a suitable 1-D layered P-velocity model. Using the new model with station delays on the surface network, epicentral location errors were reduced by approximately a factor of three and depth errors were reduced by more than a factor of ten. Significantly lower location errors can support higher-quality analyses to help improve safety in deep underground mines. Planned development of a 3-D model and additional instrument deployments will further increase location quality.
1. INTRODUCTION
Seismic monitoring has been conducted in hardrock mines since the early 1900s, when mining-induced tremors in South Africa were recognized as hazards to mine workers and nearby communities (Durrheim, 2010). Since that time, monitoring and analysis of mining- induced seismicity (MIS, see Gibowicz and Kijko, 1994, for review) has become an important aspect of ground control strategy for many seismically active mines. Seismic event monitoring can be used to identify potentially hazardous geological features (e.g,, Spottiswoode and Milev, 1998), provide information for quantifying and mitigating seismic hazards (Potvin, 2009; Hudyma and Potvin, 2010), relate damage to operational parameters (Hodgson and Joughin, 1966), and determine failure mechanisms (McGarr, 1992; Trifu et al., 2000), among other important research areas that can have significant impacts on mine safety.|","Document Type

In order to minimize or avoid lost circulation, the best measure is to prevent the initiation of fracture. However, due to rocks are naturally anisotropic, the classical fracture pressure model is not applicable for anisotropic formations. Some researchers had therefore investigated the influence of transverse isotropic material parameters, but the influence of anisotropic tensile strength was ignored. The present work is to propose a novel fracture-initiation pressure model of horizontal well to investigate the influence of anisotropy on fracture-initiation pressure. The present method predicting the fracture-initiation pressure was verified by a laboratory hydraulic fracturing test. The results indicated that both anisotropic modulus and tensile strength have very distinct influence on the fracture-initiation pressure. Fracture-initiation pressure declines obviously under the influence of anisotropic modulus and anisotropic tensile strength, thus the anisotropy of modulus and tensile strength cannot be ignored. The present model can provide a more accurate method for the predicting of fracture-initiation pressure for horizontal well in anisotropic formations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Due to the exhaustion of conventional petroleum resources, some unconventional petroleum resources, such as tight gas, shale gas, and coal-bed gas, gradually be paid more attention. To develop these unconventional petroleum resources, more and more complicated structure wells, such as directional well, horizontal well, and extended reach well, are used to enlarge the drainage area and enhance oil and gas recovery (Ma et al., 2015). However, drilling horizontal wells usually bring out some new problems, such as wellbore collapse, lost circulation, cuttings transport, the excessive drag and torque (Ma and Chen, 2015; Ma et al., 2015, 2016). Thereinto, lost circulation is a classical wellbore instability problem encountered during drilling (Zoback, 2007; Fjar et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2008; Aadnoy and Looyeh, 2011), consequently, not only lose a lot of materials and costs, but also increase the non-productive time (NPT).|","Document Type

Through the utilization of cemented paste backfill (CPB) material for localized ground support, modern stope-and-fill mining operations have been able to increase productivity, effectively manage mine waste costs, as well as provide a safer mining environment. While the application of CPB has allowed for an increase in ore recovery, it is important that engineering and operations personnel have a clear understanding of the fill material as well as the limitations of the fill design to provide the most efficient, cost-effective, and safe extraction of underground reserves. Despite extensive use of CPB in mines around the world, many fundamental factors affecting the design of safe and economical fill structures are still not well understood. A critical issue in the design of backfilled stopes is the determination of the stress state within the fill material and surrounding rock mass.
Recently work has been conducted further investigating stress distributions within engineered fill material as well as the stress interactions between the fill and the rock mass. While these works, as well as past research, have provided a wealth of knowledge on stress developments within the fill material itself, there is much room for further development of a more accurate understanding of the ability and mechanism of which the material is able to redistribute the stress around the excavation and through the fill material. This paper provides and overview of current research with respect to stress distributions for stope-and-fill mining operations and suggests areas in which further research is needed to fully comprehend the effectiveness of this newly developing ground support material.

The main purpose of the study was to estimate the technique’s applicability for determining Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio for the set of shale samples, measure geomechanical properties of these samples and the change of these properties due to the heating exposure. A number of laboratory experiments were conducted with the help of uncommon equipment combination: micro-computed tomography scanner, uniaxial compression stage, pyrolysis workstation and special computer software for image processing and analyzing. Initial experimental results affirm that it is possible to retrieve static geomechanical properties of very tiny core samples with the designed experimental workflow. This combination of equipment truly allowed us to observe the change in geomechanical properties due to the kerogen decomposition for each of the tested samples. The technique’s applicability was proved by measuring geomechanical properties of shale samples and we also determined the change in geomechanical properties due to the change of TOC content in the shale’s samples.
1. INTRODUCTION
The declining rate of conventional oil production and technological development in petroleum industry revealed an enormous interest in unconventional hydrocarbon exploitation from tight formations for petroleum companies. The amount of risked shale oil in-place can be up to 4 times bigger than the amount of conventional oil (Kuuskraa et al., 2013) and because of that unconventional resources have a big potential in the foreseeable to be widely developed.
Today, geomechanical engineering plays a big role in unconventional resource development that is based mainly on enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques for hydrocarbon production. These EOR techniques basically change the rock matrix sufficiently and this change should be taken in its step into considerations of the drilling program, drilling fluid design, well design, completion, in production and modeling operations.|","Document Type

S., Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources","|ABSTRACT: The present study proposes a back analysis method for estimating the geotechnical parameters of the surrounding rock mass in tunneling. This method takes a direct search approach based on a successive response surface method, where the size of the region of interest is adjusted to facilitate a fast convergence of the parameter estimation process. Using a software tool developed in this study, the response surface method is combined with a numerical code, FLAC2D, which has been popularly used in numerical simulations of underground problems. Based on a railway tunnel example, the computational accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are investigated. The back-calculations between the algorithm, which considers the adjustment of the region of interest, and the non-adjustment algorithm are compared to understand how the adjustment affects the back analysis results. In addition, the effect of different locations of measurement points at the tunnel roof and sidewalls on parameter estimation is investigated. The results of these investigations show that the adjustment algorithm can produce better results in computational accuracy and efficiency than the non-adjustment algorithm. Back-calculated solutions for different locations of measurement points agree well with the exact solution, suggesting there are no significant differences between converged parameter values.
1. INTRODUCTION
A fundamental element of the observational method in tunneling is the use of monitored data to assess the adequacy of the employed design and to predict the behavior of rock mass during future construction stages. In situ ground movement or convergence of a tunnel is often used as input data to calibrate numerical or analytical models, so that the predicted values of rock mass responses match the corresponding values of measured data. From this calibration, i.e., back analysis, the geotechnical parameters of the surrounding rock mass can be estimated. These estimated parameters can be compared with those determined in the design phase or obtained from previous field tests to improve and modify the material properties of the rock mass.|","Document Type

E., University of Leeds| Ougier-Simonin, A., British Geological Survey| Reeves, H., British Geological Survey| Berry, T. W., Arup, Lendal Arches","|ABSTRACT: The preparation of identical synthetic samples with the same morphological and mechanical characteristics allows for repeatable and reliable testing of discontinuities under varying conditions. Studies on the behavior of replica discontinuities to date have mostly been undertaken on laboratory shearbox apparatus, allowing for the characterization of discontinuity mechanics at low stresses. This study presents a new methodology for creating representative replica discontinuities suitable for testing under triaxial conditions, allowing for characterization at elevated stresses and temperatures. The advancement of computer aided design (CAD), three dimensional (3D) scanning and 3D printing has been used to design and create 3D printed molds in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic. Synthetic materials are then cast in to the molds creating cylindrical samples with a pre-existing discontinuity of quantifiable morphology suitable for triaxial testing. Statistical and visual analyses show the morphological characteristics of the synthetic discontinuities to be highly repeatable. In addition, the mechanical behavior of different synthetic compositions in unconfined compressive strength and triaxial is compared to the behavior of natural lower strength sedimentary lithologies. The behavior of the tested synthetic materials is found to not be representative of lower strength sedimentary lithologies, with stress-strain behavior showing failure in a quasi-brittle manner.
1. INTRODUCTION
All rock masses contain discontinuities such as fractures, faults, joints, bedding planes and shear zones. Failure through intact rock is uncommon unless stresses are extremely high. The behavior and strength of the rock mass is instead commonly controlled by the behavior and strength of the discontinuities (Hoek, 1983). Triaxial testing of discontinuities was first undertaken by (Jaeger, 1959) and was used for testing discontinuity mechanics throughout the 1960s on synthetic replica discontinuities, artificially created discontinuities and real discontinuities (Raleigh and Paterson, 1965; Byerlee, 1967; Heuze and Goodman, 1967). Raleigh and Paterson (1965) also carried out some of the earliest work of testing discontinuities at elevated temperatures.|","Document Type

A compositional reservoir simulator which is fully coupled with geomechanics was used for this study. Both mechanical effects due to propped fractures and poroelastic effects due to production are considered while calculating stress changes. It was found that highly compressible, low viscosity fluids such as gases result in a lower stress reversal than lesser compressible fluids such as oils. For a volatile oil, the appearance of gas phase when pressure falls below the bubble point, reduces the stress reorientation as compared to not accounting for phase change and assuming a single hydrocarbon phase. The higher the fraction of the most volatile component, the lower is the resulting stress reversal. Similar conclusions are obtained for vertical wells with a single fracture and horizontal wells with multiple fractures. These findings highlight the importance of considering fluid type and composition while designing refracturing jobs based on the modified stress field due to prior production.
1. INTRODUCTION
The key to achieving a successful refracturing treatment is stimulating new reservoir volume that has not been drained effectively. Considerable efforts have been made recently to achieve predictable and repeatable results from refracturing due to high decline rates from horizontal wells and low oil prices. Some of these include, identifying role of diverting agents (Fragachan et al., 2015; Leonard et al., 2015), improving candidate well selection (Barree et al., 2017) and modifying the design of the refracture based on stress changes. Stress changes happen around candidate refrac-wells because of (a) mechanical effects due to propped fractures and (b) poroelastic effects due to prior production from the stimulated rock volume. The in-situ stresses, which govern the subsequent fracture growth during refracturing, are thus modified in both magnitude and direction. It has been well established in both modeling (Liu et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2012; Weng and Siebrits, 2007) and field case studies (Wright and Connant, 1995; Ajani and Kelkar, 2012; Warpinski and Branagan, 1989) that mechanical and poroelastic effects modify the insitu stresses and thus determine the direction and geometry of subsequent fracture growth.|","Document Type

B., University of Waterloo| Dusseault, M. B., University of Waterloo","|ABSTRACT: Fracture initiation and propagation are important research topics in reservoir geomechanics. A high proportion of the oil and gas reservoirs around the world are carbonate reservoirs, dominated by brittle and fractured carbonate rocks such as calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). Investigation of fracture behavior has been extensively carried out by different approaches but usually involving macro-scale continuum-based methods. Such methods have limitations for analyzing discontinuous porous media like carbonate rocks. Dis-continuum based methods are needed for understanding fracture complexity challenges in naturally fractured strata. Micro-scale dis-continuum methods such as Molecular Dynamic (MD) modelling have been widely used in physics and mechanics, but much less so in rock mechanics. This article contains a literature review of MD modeling and dis-continuum methods for fracture simulation, addressing their advantages and disadvantages. Subsequently, the context of MD as a micro-scale dis-continuum method is described. Then, a MD model of pure calcium carbonate (Calcite) is developed and a numerical simulation of a uniaxial test is carried out. Results are compared to simple uniaxial experiments, and results showed fair agreement. This preliminary application of MD at a small scale may aid in understanding and implementing fracture initiation and small-scale fracture propagation during early stages of the fracture stimulation process.
1. INTRODUCTION
Over half of the oil reservoirs in the world are carbonate reservoirs (Payne et al, 2014). Especially, a large proportion of the oil and gas reservoirs in the Middle East are fractured carbonate reservoirs (Manrique et al., 2004). Enhancement of oil and gas recovery (EOR) in such reservoirs due to the continued energy demand and limited resources of fossil fuels (Zhao, 2010) will likely entail hydraulic fracturing (HF) methods. To develop an optimum EOR plan, HF in a carbonate reservoir should be modelled in a physically reasonable manner (Zhao, 2012) at an appropriate scale. This may involve different HF modelling approaches for different scales because natural discontinuities are not distributed in a consistent fractal dimension. HF propagation modelling in carbonate rocks is also influenced by parameters such as the initial pressure distribution, reservoir heterogeneity (at various scales), tensile strength of geo-materials, and external stress conditions (Kim and Moridis, 2015).|","Document Type

H., Misan University| Alsubaih, Ihsan, South Refinery Company","|ABSTRACT: Wellbore instability problems are often encountered during drilling processes of highly deviated wells, although a comprehensive geomechanical model is conducted. The low quality of the input data for the geomechnics models is the root cause of the vast majority of the drilling events. Therefore, the quality control is strongly required to ensure problems-free wellbore. In this regard, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to the stresses and rock strength parameters are carried out in this study to improve preciseness of the geomechanical model. The Tornado chart is constructed to present the high sensitive parameters of the geomechanical model, while the Monte Carlo simulator is used to determine the less certain parameters. Furthermore, history matching procedure is introduced to validate some key variables in the model. Data from twenty-seven wells in an oil field in southern Iraq is implemented to maintain the wellbore integrity for the upcoming wells. Thus, this work can be presented as decision-making guideline not only to mitigate the drilling problems but also to reduce the unplanned costs.
1. INTRODUCTION
Stability of the wellbore is crucially considered by operators during the exploration and development stages of an oil/gas field and it requires a high-quality data to ensure safe drilling operations. However, there is always a certain level of uncertainty in the data of a design based on the estimation approach (Morita, 1995; Mostafavi et al., 2011). Ideally, the upper and lower limits of the drilling fluid density design are typically estimated by the implementation of the geomechanical model. The uncertainty in wellbore stability analysis can lead to the increase of nonproductive time of the drilling operations or, in some cases, to induce catastrophic consequences (Savari and Kumar, 2012). The main causes of the uncertainty belong to the ways of the measurement or the estimation of the input parameters of the model (Aadnoy, 2011). Generally, some variables can be measured directly with a high degree of confidence such as pore pressure, while others are estimated indirectly such as in-situ stresses. The rock strength parameters have a noticeable contribution, to some degree, to the uncertainty regardless the various approaches of estimation. In this study, a geomechanical model has been investigated to reduce the uncertainty in the input data based on history matching, sensitivity, and uncertainty approaches. Initially, the calibration of the input data has been conducted, then the sensitivity analysis by Tornado chart is established. The history matching is performed to obtain the most sensitive parameters based on data from twenty-seven wells in an oil-field in southern Iraq. The uncertainty analysis is utilized by mean of Monte Carlo simulation to Quantitative risk assessment (QAS) in order to mitigate the associate error in the input data. The main purpose of the analysis is to design a high confidence model to prevent shear failure in shale layers of Tunama formation and the consequences such as pipe sticking, tight hole, and hole enlargement. The severity of drilling incidents in this zone were reviewed extensively by Alusbaih and Nygaard (2016), and it worth to mention that a considerable time was consumed during directional drilling within Tanuma as can be noticed in figure (1). Caliber logs of three wells have shown the hole enlargement in those wells while drilling Tanuma formation due to the shear failure as illustrate in figure (2). Therefore, a reliable prediction to the drilling fluid density, to mechanically hold back the well-bore, can be served as decision making option to mitigate such kind of problems.|","Document Type

Caving operations are typically influenced by the heterogeneous nature of the rock mass; in particular, the spatial variability of the natural fracture network holds significant implications with respect to rock mass fragmentation. In the current paper, an in-situ fragmentation model is generated for an operational block cave mine using Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models. Major structures were included in the model in a deterministic manner and the spatial variability of fracture intensity was analysed to generate a geostatistical block model. The block model of volumetric fracture intensity value (P32) was then used an indicator of the rock mass structural character and fragmentation. Finally, the in-situ fragmentation curves were compared to secondary fragmentation curves using field measurements of secondary fragmentation to investigate the possible links between in-situ fragmentation, secondary fragmentation, height of draw and observed hang-ups.
1. INTRODUCTION
Block caving is a cost effective underground mining techniques that largely relies on gravity to extract the ore. As large open-pit operations approach the end of their mine life, block caving methods are increasingly becoming the method of choice for the mining industry, since they have the potential to yield extraction rates on a scale comparable to open pit mining (e.g. in excess of 100,000 tpd); caving methods also allow for high efficiency and low production costs (Vyazmensky et al., 2009). However, both the scale of the problem and the lack of direct access to the rock mass at project evaluation and design stages makes the characterization and accurate prediction of rock mass fragmentation a very difficult task. In this context, caving geomechanics is still largely an empirically based discipline (Vyazmenzky et al., 2010).
A general block caving mine layout is shown in Figure 1. Broken ore falls into the production level through the drawpoints. As the ore is removed, the ore above continues to break and cave in by gravity.|","Document Type

In this paper, a three-dimensional fracture height model of layered tight gas reservoirs is presented to investigate how these factors influence the geometries of hydraulic fractures. A typical hydraulic fracturing process of a vertical well in Ordos basin, China is simulated with this model. The result shows that vertical fractures are mainly formed during the treatment, and the fracture height is dominated by in-situ stress. Stress difference higher than 4MPa shows great effectiveness in fracture height containment. In addition, the result indicates that lower elastic modulus is favorable for fracture height containment while Possion’s ratio has almost no effect. Fracture propagation is strongly inhibited with injection rates lower than 6m3/min under stress difference higher than 4MPa. When stress difference is no more than 2MPa, the fracture height grows well with increasing injection rates. Fluid viscosity lower than 10mPa•s has negligible impact. Perforation location plays an important role in the fracture initiation stage. Fracture geometries differ distinctly with varied perforation locations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Recently, massive hydraulic fracturing(MHF) has been widely used to stimulate tight gas reservoirs with an effort to produce commercial quantities of natural gas(Economides and Nolte 2000). MHF is designed to contain the fractures within the pay zone. If a fracture crosses into the adjacent rock layers, an excessive amount of material and effort can be wasted when fracturing the unproductive zones(Abbas et al. 2014). In contrast, if the designed height of the hydraulic fractures is not achieved, a large area of the productive zone cannot be stimulated, which affects the production rates. Estimation or determination of fracture height has been the most difficult technical problem and an important issue in hydraulic fracturing researches. (Chuprakov and Prioul 2015).|","Document Type

Understanding the controls on fracture behavior in these unconventional reservoirs is important for their successful production. This research examines the influence of rock-mechanical properties on fracture characteristics in finely-layered reservoirs. Rock-mechanical laboratory experiments have been performed on layered shale-sandstone samples and layered granite-sandstone samples, in order to investigate the rock-mechanical parameters and fracture geometry. Fracture characterization, including fracture initiation, propagation, orientation, and interaction between the multiple layers was performed using x-ray micro-computed tomography scans. Predictions of the rock-mechanical properties of a layered material can be made using the Reuss-bound averaging each individual layer. The strength, however, cannot be averaged. Fracture initiation is highly dependent on rock strength: fractures initiate at the failure point of the weakest layer, after which they do propagate at low average stress levels through stronger layers due to local stress amplification at the fracture tip. The fractures change their orientation through layers with different mechanical properties. The results show that the variability in rock-mechanical properties influences the fracture behavior in a finely-layered reservoir.
1. INTRODUCTION
The development of low-permeability reservoirs generally requires hydraulic fracturing. Fracture geometry is an important concern for the successful development of unconventional reservoirs (Teufel and Clark, 1984). These reservoirs often consist of many lithological units, which create significant variation in lithology and therefore in mechanical properties (Passey et al., 2010; Sone and Zoback, 2013). This heterogeneity complicates predictions on the fracture behavior within the rock succession and on the fracture geometry developed during stimulation. Fractures might stop at the interface in a layered reservoir. In this case, the fracture might not fully cover the target zone. On the other hand, when the fracture propagates through stronger rocks, the fracture may rupture the cap rock and create reservoir leakage. Therefore, understanding the controls on fracture behavior and fracture geometry is important for the successful development of low-permeability reservoirs.|","Document Type

The existence of the pores in the rocks will cause stress concentrations where isolated pores or cracks may nucleate favorably and crack growth will be strongly affected during hydraulic fracturing, as an enhanced production technique in unconventional reservoirs. Unlike the more homogeneous pores in sandstones, the pore structures in the shale formations are heterogeneous and complex to quantify due to the diagenesis and geological processes that the shale has undergone. Formations with heterogeneous microstructures may introduce a heterogeneous stress field during the fracturing stimulation, which can influence the crack growth and continuity. Therefore, quantifying the microstructural heterogeneity of the shale formations is essential in stimulation performance and production analysis from unconventional reservoirs. In this paper, samples from the Middle Bakken Formation, which is a typical unconventional reservoir in North America, were collected. Field-emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) was used to produce the images from the samples. After the segmentation of these images, the lacunarity method was applied to analyze the heterogeneous of the pore structures. Finally, based on the choosing of the REA (representative elementary area) using the porosity indicator, we calculated the heterogeneity of pore structures of different samples and compared the values.
1. INTRODUCTION
Unconventional reservoir play nowadays has been an important part in the world oil and gas total production. Unlike the more homogeneous pores in sandstones, pores in unconventional reservoirs such as shale formations are always heterogeneous due to the diagenesis and geological processes. The heterogeneities, which can be identified over the various scale from nanometers to meters, will result in the difference in the properties of the rocks such as flow and mechanical properties (Vasseur et al., 2015).

One of the key parameters affecting the performance of the hydraulic stimulation is the mechanical properties of the rocks i.e. fracture toughness. This parameter is a measure of material resistance to extension of a crack. For conventional reservoirs like sandstone, it is relatively straightforward to obtain cores or large samples to do the standard fracture toughness tests to measure this parameter. However, for the unconventional reservoirs like shales, due to the unstable chemical and mechanical properties, it is very expensive and sometimes impossible to get the cores and suitable sample sizes to perform the standard toughness test. Determining how to quantify the fracture toughness of shale formation remains a challenge. Nano-indentation, which can eliminate the need for large samples, shows a potential application in estimating the fracture toughness of shales. In this paper, samples from Upper Bakken Formation or Middle Bakken Formation were collected and analyzed. After sample preparation, a nano-indenter was applied to estimate Young’s Modulus and Hardness. Finally, based on the energy theory, the fracture toughness of each sample was calculated and compared.
1. INTRODUCTION
As the increasing demand for the oil and gas energy along with the decline production of the conventional oil and gas reservoir, unconventional resources such as the shale reservoir energy has become an important part (Youns, et al., 2014). Hydraulic fracturing is one of the major tools that industry applied nowadays to increase the production. Rock’s elastic and mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, fracture toughness, and Poisson’s ratio are important design parameters in hydraulic fracturing (Liu et al., 2016). Elastic modulus can influence the stability of fractures while fracture toughness – a generic term for analyzing material resistance to the extension of a crack – can influence the geometry of the fractures.|","Document Type

Specimens were loaded either diametrically to determine their splitting tensile strength using the Brazilian test configuration, either axially at five (5) levels of confinement, i.e. unconfined, 2, 4, 8 and 15 MPa, to determine their peak compressive strength and compute the parameters of the strength envelope. Triaxial confined tests were continued beyond the peak to determine the residual strength of formerly intact rock specimens. Test specimens were then slowly unconfined at a rate of 0.02 MPa/sec, while keeping the specimen into a continuous failing mode and recording both axial and confining pressures. Both sets of properties, i.e. peak and residual, are represented using the Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion for modelling rock behavior, expressed in terms of cohesion and friction angle. Results show very minimal if any scale effect when specimens were tested under axial and/or triaxial compression, for the size of specimen tested. However, a well-defined scale effect is observed with specimens tested in tension, confirming the importance of both the rock fabric and the mode of loading on the behavior of homogeneous rock materials at failure, as pointed out by most of the authors in literature. Testing methods are described and results are presented. In most cases, results are showing a very high degree of linearity and very low variability, leading to very consistent observations regarding all aspects of the testing program. © 2017 Copyright reserved, Natural Resources Canada.
1. INTRODUCTION
A sound knowledge of intact rock and rock mass properties is required to proceed with the design and ensure the performance of structures either founded on or built in rock. This statement applies to every stage of construction, starting with site investigation, sampling and testing rock materials, and asserting that the set of properties then determined is properly suited for the application foreseen. The main objective of all testing carried out over the last two decades at the CANMET Rock Mechanics Laboratory of Natural Resources Canada, located in Ottawa, Ontario, within the capital region, was to satisfy the needs of two large groups of clients, which are the mine industry and the energy sector. However large the range of applications foreseen might have been, the laboratory has focused its effort on highly specialized services in relation with first the properties of intact rocks at failure, i.e. material strength and rock deformation, and second, their evolution once the material has failed and properties are reaching their minimal, residual value [1-7]. Applications foreseen for such properties include short and long term stability of drillholes, wellbores, shafts, tunnels, caverns, mine openings, etc, used by both mine and energy sectors, to proceed either to mineral, oil and/or gas extraction (and/or storage), or to nuclear waste disposal, where stability is most suited to ensure the safety and serviceability of excavations [8-12]. A second category of applications requiring a good knowledge of laboratory rock properties concerns the capacity of the rock to either collapse and/or to flow naturally, as required with operations using mine caving and/or stoping as their main extraction method [13-15].|","Document Type

Wellbore strengthening is a mechanism to enable safe and cost-effective drilling operation by means of increasing the fracture pressure of the rock. This paper presents a model illustrating the relationship between wellbore strengthening and HPHT filtration for different permeabilities. Data were collected from previous experiments on shale and sandstone cores to increase fracture pressure by utilizing calcium-based, iron-based nanoparticles (NPs) and graphite in oil based mud. A differential evolution algorithm was used to find a poly-variate, polynomial model for breakdown pressure increase and HPHT fluid loss reductions for different permeable media. Sensitivity analysis were done to test the robustness of the results of the model and to reduce uncertainty. Based on the results, filtration reduction is dominant parameter on wellbore strengthening. The correlation shows permeability has a limited influence on increasing fracture pressure. By decreasing filtration using calcium-based and iron-based NPs in drilling fluid, fracture pressure increase in both high and low permeable formations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Exceeding the formation fracture pressure during drilling operations can result in high fluid losses, lost circulation, loss in mud hydrostatic pressure potentially resulting in a kick which could lead to a blowout. As a well deepens, the mud safe window range narrows due to the convergence of the pore and formation fracture gradient. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a mud weight to stay in the safe mud weight window. The process of increasing the wellbore pressure containment using engineered drilling fluids is called wellbore strengthening (WS). WS can be achieved by avoiding drilling fluid penetrating the formation and limiting the local increase in formation pressure around the wellbore as a result of the drilling fluid entering the formation. WS has been studied by many researchers and different procedures and techniques have been suggested. WS is applied to prevent or treat lost circulation with the goal of decreasing or limit the drilling fluid from entering the formation. WS methods include use of different additives in drilling fluids, heating the wellbore to change in situ rock stresses around borehole, and use of pills for temporarily isolating troublesome zones.|","Document Type

G., Monash University","|ABSTRACT: Proppant takes an essential role in propping the fracture open after pumping ceases in the horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing process for unconventional reservoir. However, the relatively smooth proppant may degrade the surface roughness, and alter the friction type from sliding to rolling, both of which may largely reduce the rock shear resistance. The experimental results show that there is a large decrease on both rock peak shear strength and shear stiffness with addition of proppant. The rock with reducing shear resistance has less ability to resist the horizontal shear stress due to gas transportation in the horizontal direction, making it more possible for the rock to induce relative movement. Based on the experimental data, there is a huge increase in proppant embedment rate with shear stress once obvious relative movement (like dilation) appears. Therefore, it is worth to investigate the change of rock shear resistance with the addition of proppant and keep the actual shear stress within the limit by controlling gas flow rate to prevent the relative movement of rock and maintain better proppant embedment behavior.
1. INTRODUCTION
Unconventional nature gas, mainly shale gas, is recognized as potential replacing energy resource to solve the current energy shortage problem with its high capacity. With the development of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, economic commercial production of nature gas can finally be achieved (Olaoye, Bouazza et al. 2009). In the process, proppants, small spherical particles with high strength, play an essential role in propping fractures open after pumping ceases to permit gas flow. However, proppant degradation mechanisms of diagenesis, embedment and fine generation and migration, inevitably happen due to the extreme conditions, including high temperature and stress (Alramahi and Sundberg 2012, Ghosh, Rai et al. 2014). These mechanisms greatly reduce fracture width and conductivity and eventually gas production. of all those mechanisms, proppant embedment is recognized as the most common and severe one. Under deep reservoir with high vertical stress, the proppant particle tends to indent into the rock mass, causing the fracture reduction or even closure (Volk, Raible et al. 1981).|","Document Type

Tests were performed under constant Lode angle conditions at Lode angles of 23.4, 16.1 and 0°. The constant Lode angle condition was maintained by holding the minimum principal stress constant while increasing the maximum and intermediate principal stress at a predetermined ratio. Tests were performed at minimum principal stresses of 5, 17 and 30 MPa. All of the specimens failed in a brittle manner, with significant dilatant volume strain accumulated, and failure showed a strong dependence on Lode angle. Specimens behaved in a nearly linear elastic manner until approximately 75% of the peak stress was reached. The angle of the failure feature (shear band) was compared to predictions developed by using the Rudnicki and Rice (1975) localization criterion. It was found that there was good agreement (within 7°) between the experimental results and theoretical predictions.
1. INTRODUCTION
Recently there has been a renewed interest in the United States regarding the utilization of deep igneous rock formations for nuclear waste disposal (Brady et al. 2009). The idea behind this is that by utilizing the deep formations that have little hydrologic exchange with higher strata due to the high pressure and low permeability in these regions. The high lithostatic pressure would preclude hydraulic fracture of the rock thereby preventing the drilling and emplacement operations from further fracturing the rock and providing a pathway for radionuclides to migrate upwards. In order to ensure that this operation, should it be undertaken, is a safe and secure repository for nuclear waste, regardless of the type or quantity of radioactive material, the rocks being used for emplacement must be well understood. Therefore, we have undertaken an experimental investigation into the failure of granitic rock under general (true triaxial) states of stress to determine the mode of failure and have compared that mode to an established localization theory to determine its applicability to predicting failure features in this rock.|","Document Type

Detail core examination of the natural tectonic structures and mechanically significant features comprised: mineral veins, fractured veins, bare fractures, slickensides, fault zones and bedding planes. All of our observations were compared with available, geophysical logging data. The most common tectonic structures are steep, rather small strata-bound fractures and veins with very low kinematic aperture. They create an orthogonal joint system locally disturbed by minor faults. For these regular joints, we have calculated average fracture intensity parameter by averaging fracture area per cubic meter of rock. We also constructed rose diagrams of fractures orientation weighted with height, aperture or percentage of cracked veins and also taking into account an orientation error. Obtained weighted diagrams enhance dominant sets of fractures and are more relevant for reservoir characterization than common diagrams considering only numbers of fractures. Finally, we compared results received from core with those from borehole scanner interpretation. This comparison reveals some interesting discrepancy between fracture profiles based on borehole scanner logs and direct borehole core profiles. |1. INTRODUCTION |Natural discontinuities occurring in low permeable shale reservoir are important for borehole completion and hydrocarbon exploitation. Natural fractures and other tectonic structures control effective reservoir properties, such as: permeability and anisotropy (Hennings, 2009, Odling, 1992, Pijush et al., 2007), behavior of induced hydraulic fracture during fracturing treatment (Gale et al., 2006, Warpinski and Teufel, 1987) and size and shape of stimulated reservoir volume (Greenwood, 2015). Open minor- and moderate-scale penetrative fractures increase reservoir drainage and create additional space for free hydrocarbon accumulation. In contrast, large tectonic structures like seismic-scale faults can be harmful for exploitation, as they may capture fracking fluid, cause hydrocarbons escape or brine invasion into reservoir (Bratton et al., 2006).|",""

We describe the hierarchic system of Consistent Lithological Units (CLUs) to ease compilation and extrapolation of analyses at different scales and resolution. Higher level member (CLU3) are traceable from well to well at distances of tens of kilometers across the Baltic Basin. The dependence between mineralogical composition and elastic modulus with emphasis on the role of calcite is analyzed. The results show that carbonates may have had a stronger impact on the Young’s modulus and brittleness index growth than quartz. These observations led us to modify the conventionally used mineralogical brittleness index by incorporation of TOC factor and determination of the calcite placement in the formula numerator. We also compare the intensity of vertical and horizontal fractures with the calculated brittleness index and conclude that the natural fracture density is not a direct function of shale brittleness. |1.

The Ordovician and Silurian shales located in the Baltic Basin have emerged as one of the most promising targets for shale gas exploration. The companies drilled several tens of exploration boreholes which provided wealth of information about petrophysical and mechanical properties of the shales. Increasing demand to understand the structure and behavior of these rocks led us to commence our geomechanical research.

The test is simple and fast, but there have been some discrepancies in the test results which are related to the type of equipment, condition of the rock surface, operator skills, testing procedures, and measuring the wear flat. This paper focuses on the estimation of CAI and investigates the impact of various parameters on that. Results of a limited Cerchar tests on a set of rock samples from different laboratories are analyzed to correlate rock properties data to CIA value, which every value indicate an abrasiveness classification. As a result of a literature review, it is concluded that the abrasiveness of a rock sample based on the CAI value is strongly correlated with uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and brittleness of rock samples. Rock brittleness is a function of UCS and Brazilian tensile strength (BTS). Thus, collected data of these parameters were hired to develop and train artificial neural networks (ANN) as an artificial intelligence (AI) method for estimation of drilling tool wear using data of rock strength and brittleness as inputs. It is pursued by the application of pattern recognition which is achieved by ANNs.
1. INTRODUCTION
In this research, artificial neural networks (ANN) are applied to predict drilling bit wear using collected and calculated data of rock abrasiveness, including uniaxial compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength and rock brittleness.
This purpose is pursued by performance of pattern recognition as it is one of the major applications of ANNs. The final proposed neural networks produces the abrasiveness classification by receiving data of UCS, BTS and brittleness.
1.1. Wear and Rock Abrasiveness The wear is in many ways similar to the effect of harder minerals on softer ones and is easily represented by the scratch that the hard objects engrave in soft minerals.

J., Missouri University of Science and Technology| Anderson, N. L., Missouri University of Science and Technology","|ABSTRACT: Conventional techniques such as boreholes and test pits have been used for geotechnical site investigation purposes for many years. These conventional techniques are invasive, time-consuming and expensive. To minimize costs and to complement intrusive investigation techniques, geophysical methods are now commonly employed for geotechnical investigations in karst terrain. One relatively new non-invasive geophysical technique is the active multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) tool. This paper explores the utility of using the active MASW tool in karst terrain. A 20-pound sledge hammer was used as an acoustic source; a Seistronix Ras-24 channel seismograph was used to record the MASW field data. MASW field data were processed with SurfSeis4 software; the output at each test location was a 10-layer shear-wave velocity profile of the subsurface. Borehole control and 2-D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data were used to verify and constrain the interpretations of the output 1-D shear-wave velocity profiles. The results show that MASW can reliably be utilized to map variations in the engineering properties of soil/rock and to estimate depth to top of rock in karst terrain.
1. INTRODUCTION
Conventional methods such as drilling and trenching have been utilized for subsurface investigations for many years. However, geophysical techniques are now being increasingly used to investigate construction sites in karst terrain. Geophysical surveys typically complement intrusive geotechnical investigations. They are also non-invasive, less expensive and more rapid. Geophysical techniques that have been utilized for investigating karst terrain include electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), ground penetrating radar (GPR), gravity, electromagnetic (EM), and seismic methods (Obi, 2012; Yassin, 2013; Nouioua et al., 2013; Martinez-Moreno et al., 2014; Giorgi and Leucci, 2014). The choice of a particular geophysical method for imaging the subsurface is dependent on the physical characteristics of the target.
Active Multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW), a geophysical technique for determining the accoustic properties of soil/rock and estimating the top of rock is being increasingly employed to investigate complex karst terrain. This study is aimed at exploring the utility of the geophysical technique in karst terrain. The active MASW tool consists of a seismograph, an active acoustic source (e.g sledge hammer) and an array of receivers (geophones). The active MASW tool records acoustic energy generated by the active source and calculates surface wave phase velocities. The phase velocity data are analyzed; the output at each test location is a 10-layered 1-D shear-wave velocity profile that typically extends to a depth of about 100 feet (30 m). Shear-wave velocity is a function of soil and/or rock rigidity.|","Document Type

In this work, we develop dual-porosity, dual-permeability finite element models to simulate multicomponent gas flow in porous media coupled with shale deformation and sorption behavior. We use this model to explore the injection of pure CO2, pure N2, and mixtures of CO2 and N2 in different ratios to enhance shale gas recovery (ESGR). This behavior necessarily includes the evolution sorption-induced strain by competitive adsorption and its influence on permeability of matrix and fractures to ultimately define cumulative production history of CH4. The results show that injecting pure CO2 can increase shale gas recovery by <U+02DC>20%. Injection of N2 works as an ESGR agent and can increase shale gas recovery by <U+02DC>80%. Injecting a mixture of N2 and CO2 of different gas ratios results in recovery ranging between <U+02DC>20% and <U+02DC>80% (pure component end-member cases). Moreover, injecting N2 in higher proportions relative to CO2 is more beneficial since N2 shows higher recovery in ESGR. Therefore, increasing injection pressure is not the only means to achieve higher production, instead, increasing N2-CO2 gas ratio can achieve the same goal. The observations also show that although CO2 is not sensitive to pressure in performing ESGR, it is sensitive to pressure when accounting for sequestered CO2. Furthermore, the sequestration of CO2 by injecting CO2-N2 mixtures does not simply increase as CO2-N2 gas ratio increases. Since higher CO2-N2 ratio results in a decrease in shale gas recovery, which leads to more CH4 left in the reservoir to compete with CO2 for sorption sites, this also results in reduced CO2 sequestration.
1. INTRODUCTION
Shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas in the United States. In 2000, shale gas provided only 1% of U.S. natural gas production, but this increased to 20% by 2010 (Stevens 2012). The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that, by 2035, 46% of natural gas supply in the United States will come from shale gas. Shale gas comes from gas shales, which are organic-rich formations that are both source rock and reservoir (Cipolla, Lolon et al. 2009). Unlike other conventional reservoirs, whose high permeability enables vertical wells to extract gas, the ultra-low permeability of shale traps the source methane within the shale. Vertical wells are only able to drain gas from a small tributary volume. This prevents vertical wells from producing sufficient gas to be economical (Zoback, Kitasei et al. 2010). Over the past decade, however, the application of two techniques, horizontal drilling, and hydraulic fracturing, has made it possible to extract gas economically from shale formations at significant depth. Their use in the Barnett Shale near Fort Worth, Texas, demonstrated that these techniques could be key to producing trillions of cubic feet of natural gas estimated to exist in shale gas plays throughout the United States (Soeder 2012). However, field production data of shale gas wells show a rapid decline in gas flow rate after a few years of production. This drawback has focused attention on finding other ways to enhance shale gas recovery.|","Document Type

A., The University of Melbourne","|ABSTRACT: Water-based fracking fluids are currently used to enhance the gas production from unconventional gas reservoirs, while the formation damage due to the interaction between rock matrix and residual water significantly reduce the pore space available for gas movement. In this paper, the effect of different fracturing fluids on fracture permeability is investigated using the same fractured siltstone sample in five rounds of cycling test (CO2-CO2-CO2-water-CO2). The experimental results reveal that the maximum confining pressure dominated fracture permeability. The fracture permeability for CO2 at 10MPa confining pressure decreased by around 75% after applying 40MPa confining pressure. After water flooding in the fourth round, the fracture permeability for CO2 was considerably reduced by around 70-85% compared with that in the second cycling test, and the influence of water flooding was much stronger at lower CO2 injection pressure. The experimental results showed that the fracture permeability for gas reduced significantly after water flooding due to formation damage. Thus, liquid CO2 is much more suitable than water as fracturing fluid for clay-abundant unconventional gas reservoirs.
1. INTRODUCTION
As an efficient and greener source of energy, shale gases currently attracting more interest (Conti et al., 2014), however, the ultralow permeability (<0.001mD) of shale matrix is the major barrier to shale gas commercial production (Daigle and Screaton, 2015, Kumar et al., 2015). The development of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has been therefore used to enhance the shale formation productivity, and water-based fracturing fluids has been commonly used (Johnson and Johnson, 2012, Nicot and Scanlon, 2012, Boz and PE, 2014, Ghahremani and Clapp, 2014).
While the interaction between water and rock minerals, especially clay minerals, can lead to severe formation damage and long clean time (Arnold, 1998, Lal and Amoco, 1999). Many experimental investigations have been carried out on the effect of water saturation on the mechanical behavior of reservoir rock (Shukla et al., 2013, Rathnaweera et al., 2014, Dyke and Dobereiner, 1991, Erguler and Ulusay, 2009). For example, according to Shukla et al., (2013) and Rathnaweera et al., (2014), water sensitivity or softening of rock samples due to the saturation effect can greatly reduce the mechanical strength of dry reservoir rock. While the soften effect can induce a decrease of propped fracture conductivity because the deformation squeezes the fracture width, and strong absorption of rock matrix to water will block the gas flow channel in fractures, so the presence of water in formation can greatly reduce the gas production, especially for water sensitive formations (Cheng, 2012).|","Document Type

We investigate the effects of variable fluid injection rate on the stability of a nearby fault using three-dimensional fully coupled poroelastic finite element simulations for injection into a multi-layer sequence containing a favorably orientated normal fault that extends from the injection reservoir into underlying crystalline basement. We consider three injection scenarios with constant, increasing, and decreasing injection rates but same overall injection duration and same total injection volume. Our simulations demonstrate that maximum excess pore pressure and Coulomb failure stress are highly dependent on the injection strategy. Increasing and constant injection rates always result in increasing excess pore pressure and Coulomb failure stress along the fault. An initially high injection rate followed by a decrease in injection rate results in lower maximum excess pore pressure and Coulomb failure stress compared to constant or increasing injection rate cases. These results suggest that fault reactivation potential associated with wastewater injection can be reduced with a site-specific assessment of geologic, reservoir geomechanical, and operational conditions including injection duration, rate, and overall injection volume prior to the start of injection.
1. INTRODUCTION
Fluid injection into sedimentary reservoirs underlying the crystalline basement is considered a routine practice for the disposal of formation water produced during oil and gas extraction and of flowback after hydraulic fracture stimulation of unconventional reservoirs. Fluid injections have been known to induce seismic fault reactivation since the 1960s (Healy et al., 1968). The recent increase of seismic events in areas of active fluid injection and low natural seismicity has generated renewed interests in the coupled phenomena of fluid migration, poroelastic stress changes, and induced seismicity (Ellsworth, 2013; McGarr et al., 2015; Segall and Lu, 2015; Fan et al., 2016).
In addition to site-specific factors (e.g., fault size, fault orientation and distribution, in-situ stress state, initial pore fluid pressure, permeability of injection reservoir), the potential of fault reactivation in response to subsurface fluid injection is also affected by operational parameters (e.g., injection rate, cumulative injected volume, wellhead injection pressure, depth of injection, distance above crystalline basement, distance to known faults) (Ellsworth, 2013; McGarr, 2014; Weingarten et al., 2015). The excess pressure above the background pore fluid pressure generated by injection decreases the effective normal stress on the fault and potentially leads to fault reactivation (Kim, 2013; Block et al., 2014). However, previous studies on variable injection rate focus on average injection rate or cumulative injection volume at larger time domain and overlook the influence of injection history on fault reactivation (e.g., Kim, 2013; Segall and Lu, 2015; Fan et al., 2016). Reported injection activities reveal significant temporal variations of injection rate, which may result in distinct site responses. Reported trends of injection include increasing (e.g., site J-A in Barnett Shale, Texas, Frohlich, 2012), decreasing (e.g., “south well” near Timpson, Texas, Frohlich et al., 2014), and constant rates (e.g., “north well” near Timpson, Texas, Frohlich et al., 2014). Moreover, many previous numerical simulations on fault reactivation by fluid injection resort to a critical pore pressure by solving the standard fluid diffusion equation and neglect the effect of fault orientation and in-situ stress state (Shapiro et al. 2013; Keranen et al., 2014). To evaluate the stress changes and pore pressure perturbations at the fault, numerical analysis that uses reliable geological information and accounts for coupled geomechanical and reservoir flow processes is desired (Fan et al., 2016).|","Document Type

Porous test specimens with injection points in different configurations are placed between two transparent plates. Experiments are conducted to examine hydraulic fracture growth in proximity to a constant pressure injection source as well as propagation of multiple neighboring fractures under different injection conditions. The fracturing process is recorded using a high resolution digital camera. A variety of fracture behavior is observed in these experiments that demonstrate the interplay between high pore pressure regions, the applied contrast in far-field stresses, and fluid injection scheme and configuration of injectors.
1. INRODUCTION
Changes in pore pressure by fluid injection or production in oil and gas reservoirs can have a significant influence on the magnitude and orientation of in-situ stresses. Initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures can, therefore, be affected by a perturbation of pore pressure field.
Bruno and Nakagawa (1991) performed laboratory experiments in which a hydraulic fracture was propagated from an injection port in thin sandstone slabs under the influence of a nearby fluid injection source maintained at constant pressure. The experiments reported by the authors were performed without applying far-field stresses, i.e. under isotropic far-field stress state. Bouteca et al. (1983) reported an experimental result showing hydraulic linkage between two injection ports that were offset by 10 degrees from an applied maximum far-field stress without reporting the specifics of the experiment. Analytical and numerical evaluation of similar problems were reported by Berchenko and Detournay (1997) and Wang et al. (2013).
In this work, we performed an experimental study that examines the effect of pore pressure on hydraulic fracture growth using novel experimental capabilities. A series of tests were performed in a systematic manner under various fluid injection schemes and configurations and varying contrast in the applied far-field stresses.|","Document Type

Aim of this work is to build a simplified fully coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical model for steam penetration in heavy oil formation. Application of the model to analysis of steam penetration in a process of Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Steam Flooding are presented for the purpose of model validation and principle illustration. It can also be used for the analysis of Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS).
The process of steam penetration in enhanced heavy oil production is complicated (Yang, 1992; Al-Hadhrami, 2014; Boone, 1995; Settari, 2001; Zhao, 2013). In this process, over-heated steam whose temperature can be as high as 350°C is injected into the heavy oil formation. As the steam flow contacts the formation, heat transfer begins between the steam and formation along with the porous flow of steam within the formation.|","Document Type

Geomechanics-based wellbore trajectory optimization uses a geomechanics analysis solution, such as geostress components values. For calculation convenience, the concept of F<U+03B2> -potential which is defined on the surfaces of natural fractures with inclination angle <U+03B2> is proposed as an index for selecting the optimized wellbore trajectory. In the simplest case, the wellbore trajectory of a tight formation should be taken in the direction of maximum horizontal stress (SH) to maximize the stimulated reservoir volume. In this case, the injection-induced fracture will propagate in the direction that is perpendicular to the axis of wellbore trajectory. When a natural fracture exists in the tight formation, injection-induced fractures are believed to be determined by those natural fractures that can open under hydraulic injection stimulation. Consequently, the task of trajectory optimization is to locate those natural fractures that are easy to open with injection. These fractures are also known as critically stressed fractures (CSF). The workflow for selecting the optimized wellbore trajectory based on geomechanics solutions and the concept of CSF is presented in this paper. For trajectory optimization focused on the primary fracturing design, the workflow is performed with the initial geostress. For the optimization focused on the fracturing design in a field that is disturbed by primary fracturing from offset wells, the workflow is performed with the stress field disturbed by primary fracturing.
1. INTRODUCTION
Tight formation refers to shale gas/oil formations and tight sand gas/oil formations. Hydraulic fracturing is essential for production in tight formations. Trajectory optimization is a fundamental aspect of a wellbore design in a tight formation with natural fractures (Bond et al., 2006; Himmerlberg and Eckert, 2013; Manchanda et al., 2012). A deliberately optimized wellbore trajectory enables maximum efficiency of hydraulic fracturing; the value of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) will reach its maximum if the trajectory is selected to go through the right place (sweet spot) and is in right direction.|","Document Type

Permeability models with such assumptions fail to explain results from stress-controlled laboratory tests and are limited in their ability to explain and match in situ data. Through our persistent efforts of almost a decade, we have removed all of these constrained conditions, proposed the local impact of coal-gas interactions on permeability, and developed new relations between coal porosity and volumetric strains under conditions of variable stress. The cubic relation between porosity and permeability is then introduced to relate coal storage capability (porosity) to coal transport characteristics (permeability) also under variable stress conditions. We implement these two relations into a sequence of finite element models to represent the geomechanics of coal-gas interactions including single through dual poroelastic models. These models couple the transport and sorption of a compressible fluid within a deformable medium where the effects of deformation are rigorously accommodated. This paper reports our novel framework on geomechanics of coal-gas interactions.
1. INTRODUCTION
From the 1970s onwards there has been a growing interest to produce coalbed methane (CBM) as a fuel (Ayer, 2002). Now it has developed dramatically and can be the energy resource solution for the next few decades (Hamawand et al., 2013). At the end of the 1980s, this industry searched for methods to enhance production. The successes of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) gave the CBM industry the idea that gas injection could also be successfully applied in unmineable coalbeds to enhance coalbed methane (ECBM) recovery (Bergen et al., 2006). Two main benefits can be obtained from ECBM with gas injection. One is to increase production rates of methane and to shorten the time to return on investment; the other is to mitigate increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere to thereby reduce effects of global climate change (Gunter et al., 1997; Reichle et al., 1999).|","Gas Adsorption,  Coal Seam Methane, Coal Permeability,  Internal Swelling"

HF is a complex engineering process with large capital costs; a rational and effective design process is the key step to mitigate the potential economic risks and increase the efficiency of the HF treatment. There are several numerical and analytical methods to simulate HF treatments and estimate the geometry of the induced fracture. In this study, the target reservoir formation, a conventional carbonate gas field, was divided into 5 geomechanical units (GMUs). Each GMU has different permeability values, which range from 3.5 to 300 mD. Geomechanical characteristics of each GMU were defined by laboratory tests to obtain fracture toughness (KIC), hydraulic tensile strength (THF), unconfined compression strength (UCS), Young’s modulus (E), Poisson’s ratio (v), cohesion (c<U+2032>) and internal friction angle (<U+03A6><U+2032>). Then, using the finite element method (FEM), HF treatment was simulated in each GMU as continuous fluid (water) injection for 20 minutes at a rate of 20 bbl/min. A cohesive zone model (CZM) was assumed for all units as a behavioral rock failure model. The fracture aperture was compared with geomechanical characteristics of each GMU, showing that aperture is strongly related to E, KIC, and THF rather than v, c<U+2032>, <U+03A6><U+2032>. Incidentally, as each of these five parameters (except v) increases, aperture decreases. Because slip and shear dilatancy of induced shear fractures was not addressed in this study, no meaningful relation between fracture aperture and c<U+2032> or <U+03A6><U+2032> exists. For a given volume of injection, fracture length is necessarily in an inverse relationship with the five parameters (except v).
1. INTRODUCTION
Improving hydrocarbon production, considering the global growing demand for hydrocarbon, is essential. Reservoir stimulation, particularly hydraulic fracturing (HF), is one of the main methods which seek to enhance hydrocarbon recovery by the faster delivery of the petroleum fluid. Basically, HF treatment works by improving the connections of the wellbore with the reservoir, aiding wells to produce fluids more quickly (Economides and Nolte, 2000, Daneshy, 2010).|","Document Type

Bit scrapped caused by cutter failure accounts for about 90% of all the failure in field operations. A majority of researches have been conducted on PDC cutter design, which were mainly concentrated on structure itself, such as stress state, self-sharpening and interface bonding strength, while neglecting the closely related factor of the rock-breaking method. This paper presents a novel PDC cutter which is designed based on the bionics theory to illustrate the layered spalling concept of rock-breaking. This paper has paid much attention to studying the numerical simulation of dynamic rock-breaking process under new bionic PDC cutter to illustrate the rock-breaking mechanism. Meanwhile, the corresponding experiments have been performed with a single cutter to validate the theory. The results indicate that: (a) the process of rock-breaking under the new bionic PDC cutter is characterized as “layered spalling” with slight oscillation comparing to the property-“Block Dropping” of conventional cutter. (b) the cutting process of bionic cutter is more stable with minor impact vibration, which contributes to improving the cutter’s life to some extent. The amplitude of cutting force reduces by 42% and the average value of the new bionic PDC cutter is 460N while the conventional PDC cutter is 790N.
1. INTRODUCTION
PDC bit is the most important tool for oil drilling. A large number of field tests and laboratory studies (Kaitkay and Lei 2005, Gouda et al. 2011) have shown that the cutting teeth are easy to fail, such as cutter chipped and broken, diamond layer peel off and wear (Lin et al. 1992). So the quality of the cutter directly affects the performance and life of the drill bit (Yahiaoui et al. 2013). There were many studies focused on the comprehensive performance of PDC cutter (Martinez et al. 2013). Most of their researches prone to ameliorate the stress condition of PDC cutter, improve cutters’ self-sharpening performance and enhance the interface bonding strength, etc.(Tammineni et al. 2013, Azar et al. 2013, Raghav et al. 2013). Meanwhile, through many new design methods have been proposed and some good effects were obtained (Zhang et al. 2013), but the problem still exists. The designs merely pay attention to the design of the cutter itself, ignoring the impact of rock breaking modes on the cutters’ performance (Gerbaud 2011).|","Document Type

The direction dependent mechanical response is captured by utilizing four types of equivalent strains, for tension and compression, parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane. The model is calibrated against triaxial compression test data, for different confinement and loading orientations. The variations of uniaxial tensile and compressive strengths with the orientation of the loading relative to the bedding follow the trends and magnitudes noted in experiments. Anisotropic non-local equivalent strains were used in the formulation to avoid localization and mesh dependence encountered with strain softening. Two different internal length parameters are used to distinguish the non-local effects along and perpendicular to the bedding. An arc length control algorithm is used to avoid convergence issues. Results of three-point bending tests confirm that the nonlocal approach indeed eliminates mesh dependency. Results show that the orientation and size of the damage process zone are direction dependent, and that materials with intrinsic transverse isotropy exhibit mixed fracture propagation modes except when the bedding aligns with the loading direction. Further research towards a multiscale hydro-mechanical fracture propagation scheme is undergoing.
1. INTRODUCTION
Modeling fracture propagation in sedimentary rocks requires complex coupled constitutive equations to account for both intrinsic and stress-induced anisotropy, and regularized numerical methods to avoid mesh size dependence due to strain softening. Experiments revealed that rock maximum axial compressive strength is reached when weak planes are either parallel or perpendicular to the loading direction, and minimum strength is reached when weak planes are orientated 30° –60° with respect to the loading direction (Donath, 1961; Niandou et al., 1997; Pietruszczak and Mroz, 2001). In indirect tensile tests, the tensile strength is maximum when tensile stress is applied within the weak plane, and gradually decreases as the orientation angle between the tensile stress direction and the bedding plane increases (Mahjoub et al., 2015). State-of-the-Art constitutive models are either based on Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) or Micromechanics. In CDM, damage criteria and evolution laws for anisotropic materials depend on a second order fabric tensor to account for the direction dependency (Pietruszczak et al., 2007). In Micromechanics models, the expression of the free energy is obtained by solving a matrix-inclusion problem for a given set of crack families. Depending on the homogenization scheme, crack interaction may or may not be accounted for. Intrinsic anisotropy is accounted for by attributing different properties to crack families of different orientations (Chen et al., 2012). Once implemented in a Finite Element (FE) code, both CDM and micromechanics models suffer from mesh dependence if strain softening is considered for compression/tension. Several localization limiters can be used, e.g. the crack band theory, a non-local integration- based formulation or non-local differentiation-based formulation. However, the non-local effects of intrinsic anisotropy are usually not accounted for.|","Document Type

A., Technical University of Denmark| Fabricius, I. L., Technical University of Denmark","|ABSTRACT: We investigate effect of testing temperature on the dynamic frame stiffness of quartz-bearing North Sea sandstone from depths of 5 km. We show that at low stress levels, the rock frame stiffens with increasing temperature and we propose an explanation for the controlling mechanisms. While equilibrating to atmospheric conditions, cooling and stress release of reservoir material can induce tensional forces in the rock frame leading to ruptures of the contact cement in the weakest grain contacts. The frame stiffness hence reduces, as the ruptures are permanent. However, a fraction of the in-situ stiffness can be restored by reestablishment of reservoir stress or temperature, but only as recovery of contact between ruptures and not as re-cementation. In literature, ruptures of contact cement are denoted as micro-cracks, strictly posing a bulk term, without distinguishing effects of stress from temperature. This is unfortunate and hence, we designed a testing program with the intension of separating and quantifying effects of temperature and stress, specifically for the sandstone material subject to this study.
1. INTRODUCTION
Increasing interest in High Pressure, High Temperature (HPHT) petroleum reservoirs, increases demand for theories and supporting experimental data, capable of describing effects of testing temperature on properties of reservoir material.
As the North Sea is geologically undergoing subsidence, sampled material has never experienced higher stress and temperature conditions than its in-situ conditions. In-situ stress and temperature conditions hence represent a physical boundary when testing, and higher or lower temperatures and stresses may not affect material properties in identical ways or to the same extent.
Contemplating the materials geological history, we designed a testing program for sandstone samples, collected in a North Sea HPHT reservoir with the intension of investigating effects of testing temperature on the materials dynamic poroelastic properties. Thus, in the effective hydrostatic stress regime from 2 to 15 MPa, corresponding to a maximum effective stress approximately 1/3 of in-situ we measured P- and S-wave moduli at temperature conditions below and equal to in-situ (165°C).|","Document Type

L., Colorado School of Mines| Huang, C., School of Petroleum Engineering| Cha, M., Texas A&M University","|ABSTRACT: In this study, 3D finite element models are developed to investigate thermally induced stress fields during cryogenic thermal stimulation using liquid nitrogen (LN2). Laboratory tests using LN2 as a fracturing fluid were carried out on concrete, sandstone, and shale samples under confined and unconfined conditions. These tests indicated different fracturing patterns. 3D finite element modeling of the laboratory tests was conducted to predict and analyze the stress behaviors around the wellbore. The combination of laboratory experiments and the 3D finite element modeling provided insight into the potential for cryogenic thermal fracturing in unconventional reservoirs. Three different types of specimen blocks were modeled. These concrete, sandstone, and multi-layer shale blocks were subjected to cryogenic thermal treatments to obtain the temperature and stress profiles and how they are influenced by the formation stiffness. Results show that model developed was successful in simulating the experimental outcomes and observations indicating distribution of high tensile stresses in tangential and longitudinal directions around the wellbore at <U+2212>321° F. The results of this paper help in understanding the mechanisms of complex fractures created by thermal shock around the wellbore in reservoirs settings.
1. INTRODUCTION
Cryogenic fracturing is the act of creating fractures by introducing very low temperature liquids into a warmer formation rock under reservoir conditions. This sudden heat transfer will cause the face of the rock to shrink, which will eventually cause the rock to fail in tension (Wang et. al, 2016 and Cha et al, 2014).
King (1983) examined the use of gelled liquid carbon dioxide to stimulate dry gas sand formations. King notes that carbon dioxide returns to the gaseous phase at formation conditions and does not cause sloughing or swelling effects in low permeable water-sensitive formations. In another study, Grundmann et al. (1998) treated a Devonian shale well with cryogenic nitrogen and observed an initial production rate 8% higher than the rate in an offset well that had been stimulated with nitrogen gas. Although the increased initial production rate in this research suggests the efficacy of cryogenic fracturing, there could be a number of reasons why an offset well in a shale formation might produce differentially including anisotropic stress conditions and heterogeneous reservoir conditions over short distances. McDaniel et al. (1997) conducted simple laboratory studies where coal samples were immersed in cryogenic nitrogen. The coal samples experienced significant shrinkage and fractured into smaller cubicle units, with the creation of microfractures orthogonal to the surface exposed to the cold fluid. The researchers found that repeated exposure cycles to the cryogen caused the coal to break into smaller and smaller pieces, becoming rubblelized. If the creation of fractures due to thermal stresses can occur in coal bed formations, it may have the potential to occur in other types of rock as well.|","Document Type

F., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory| Rutqvist, J., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory| Niemi, A., Uppsala University","|ABSTRACT: The focus of the present study is how existing pre-existing bedding planes and faults influence fracture propagation during a hydraulic fracturing operation. Hydraulic fracturing is studied by water injection into a 2 m vertical fracture, which will be called the injection fracture. Three scenarios were considered: in scenario 1, a shale-gas reservoir with a thickness of 20 m located between two confining formations each with 15 m thickness, is considered; in scenario 2, in addition to previous scenario, a horizontal bedding plane located above the injection fracture tip, is considered; in scenario 3, in addition to scenario 1, a pre-existing fault with a dip angle of 60°, located near the injection fracture, is considered. Changes in pore pressure and permeability caused by the interaction between the propagating fracture and those pre-existing geological structures, were evaluated. Results show that the fracture propagation is not influenced by the bedding plane because the slip displacement is not enough to lead to a significant pore pressure decrease and interrupt the propagating fracture. Consequently, at the injection fracture, changes in pore pressure and permeability are very similar to those obtained without the bedding plane. The pre-existing fault was found to limit the fracture propagation because of fault reactivation with shear failure. This led to a smaller increase in injection fracture permeability and a slight higher injection pressure than that observed in scenario 1.
1. INTRODUCTION
The complexity in the shale-gas formation, such as anisotropic in situ stress state, the spatial variability of rock mass properties (e.g., permeability, porosity and elastic modulus, density) (Gu et al., 2008; Hanson et al., 1980), the existence of multi-layers (Lamont and Jessen, 1963), the existence of layer interfaces (Teufel and Clark, 2010), may significantly influence the propagation of fractures in shale-gas reservoirs. Undesirable hydraulic fracturing results will not only cause economic loss but may also increase the risk of environment pollution, such as water contamination caused by the hydraulically induced fractures penetrating into groundwater layer. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures with complex geological structures and stress conditions.|","Document Type

Experimental testing at different concentrations and at various permeable media sizes was performed with chemically synthesized and mechanically generated NPs to determine the effect on decreasing fluid loss. All experiments were conducted using a standard API fluid loss apparatus. It was observed that increasing the nanoparticle concentration results in a significant decrease in fluid loss for both mechanically generated and chemically synthesized nanoparticles. The results show that chemical nanoparticles have a greater effect at reducing fluid loss than the mechanically generated nanoparticles. The observations realized are critical in application, both operationally and environmentally. Maximizing the filtration reduction of WBM into shale intervals while drilling can reduce swelling and sloughing of the formation, preventing drilling operations from being hindered. Likewise, this is mutually beneficial for the environment by preventing shallow water contamination through drilling fluid loss or filtration. The novelty of this research is a further understanding of the ability to use barite NPs in WBM, whether chemically or mechanically generated, and how each delivers a reduction in fluid filtrate for a given permeable media.
1. INTRODUCTION
The use of nanotechnology within the oil and gas industry has become more widespread over the last decade. In recent years, nano-science was predominantly employed within other industries outside of oil and gas. With beneficial properties that enhance durability, repelling effects, drug delivery and electronics (Hoelscher 2012 & Bell 2004), numerous businesses such as healthcare, defense, and coating industries realized the advantages of utilizing this technology. The fundamental benefits of utilizing nanotechnology within the oil and gas industry became of great interest as more and more hydrocarbon plays transitioned to unconventional areas. Most of these locations were found at deeper depths, increased pressures, and higher temperatures. All of these factors contribute to the hostility that the drilling and production equipment encounter, which in return, increases the cost of operating and extends the need to push these materials to their functional limitations. Nanotechnology has proven in many years past to be a great material additive in operational fluids (i.e. drilling, production and workover fluids) to deal with such conditions. The ability to engineer nanoparticles to a certain particle size, shape, size distribution, crystalline structure and composition provides the features needed to evaluate the various ways nanoparticles can be implemented into drilling and production operations (Horikoshi 2013). Moreover, the ability for nanoparticle based fluids to be tailored in regards to rheology, while remaining stable at higher temperatures and pressures, permits optimization for a rampant amount of applications (Abdo 2013 & Kasiralvalad 2014).|","Document Type

H., Tongji University| Zhang, L.

Theoretical and practical methods for estimating intact rock strength were developed during past rock engineering practices, for example, determining <U+03C3>1 from <U+03C3>2 and <U+03C3>3. While, random uncertainty inherently exists in intact rock strength. The existing methods for estimating intact rock strength seldom take this kind uncertainty into consideration. In the paper an estimated method of intact rock strength using Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed to consider the uncertainty. GPR is a nonparametric probabilistic modeling approach. And the parameter determined from given data sets obeys Gaussian distribution. The capability of GPR for estimating <U+03C3>1 from given <U+03C3>2 and <U+03C3>3 is examined. Variance and 95 percent confidence interval of the predicted intact rock strength are obtained from the proposed estimated method using GPR. To validate the efficiency of the proposed estimated method using GPR modelling approach, comparative studies have been conducted with the predicted results from the four ISRM suggested three-dimensional failure criteria. The results show that the proposed estimated method using GPR modelling approach is a promising and reliable tool for estimating the strength of intact rocks.
1. INTRODUCTION
A concerned problem regarding to excavation of rock tunnels, open pit excavation and construction of underground openings in the rocks, is to keep the surrounding rock stable. Among the factors associated with the stability of surrounding rocks is the strength of intact rocks under the confining pressures, especially for the rock engineering practices conducted in deep buried depth. When it comes to determining strength of the rock masses, the intact rock strength is usually indispensable as well. Therefore, the prediction of the intact rock strength under different confining stresses is of vital importance (Asadi et al., 2011). Quick and precise estimation of the intact rock strength, partially instead of the time-consuming direct measurement, is always desired. Theoretical and practical methods for estimating the intact rock strength are developed during the preceding rock engineering practices (Edelbro, 2003).|","Document Type

The objective of this article is to investigate fracture initiation and propagation characteristics for different radial borehole parameters. We conducted experiments using a true tri-axial fracturing simulation system under different lateral lengths, counts and azimuths. High-rank coals from the outcrop were used as the raw samples for the experiments. Results show that: the best effect is achieved when it initiates from the bedding plane where the laterals lie and forms a fracture network with one main horizontal fracture connecting multiple vertical fractures; the breakdown and injection pressure decrease with the lateral length and count increasing; increasing the lateral length enlarges the horizontal fracture area; and the optimal lateral design for horizontal initiation is four laterals with the phase of 90° and each lateral is at 45° from the horizontal in-situ stress. The key findings of this work could provide critical insights into understanding radial drilling-fracturing characteristics.
1. INTRODUCTION
Radial drilling is a technology that is able to make a right turn in a cased wellbore (vertical, slanted, or horizontal well) and then penetrate some distance out into the formation (Balch et al., 2016; W Dickinson and Dickinson, 1985; Wade Dickinson et al., 1993). The drilling tools can be high-pressure water jet, called radial-jet-drilling (RJD) (Wang et al., 2016), as well as mechanical drill bit (Balch et al., 2016). The formed radial laterals, with radius of 20–50 mm and length of 10–100 m, distributing in one layer or multiple layers, can penetrate the near well damage zone, communicate with the formation far from the main well (Cinelli and Kamel, 2013; Ragab, 2013), avoid fluid invasion damage during hydraulic fracturing (Ren et al., 2016) and increase productivity with low cost.
Radial drilling-fracturing, the integration of radial drilling and hydraulic fracturing, is an innovative approach to develop low permeability, thin target layer, naturally fractured reservoir, water flooded “dead oil area” and lithological trap reservoir, etc.(Guo et al., 2016; Megorden et al., 2013). As illustrated in Fig. 1, 8 radial laterals, distributing in two layers, are drilled from the main vertical well, and then hydraulic fracturing are operated with various fractures initiating and propagating from these radial boreholes.|","Document Type

The local anisotropic damage model is formulated by combining a free energy derived from micromechanics with phenomenological yield criteria and damage potentials. The trace of the total strain is used to distinguish tensile and compressive loading paths, and to account for the influence of the confining pressure on the propagation of compression cracks. Yield criteria in tension and compression are expressed in terms of equivalent strains, which depend on the difference between principal strain components. A non-local measure of strain is used to avoid localization. Constitutive parameters are calibrated against published experimental data for concrete and shale. Simulations of three-point bending tests show that non-local enhancement is necessary and efficient to avoid mesh dependency upon strain softening. Simulations of borehole excavation damage zone show that the damage model is not mesh dependent upon stress hardening. Numerical predictions are in agreement with experimental observations and the model can capture unilateral effects, tensile softening, compressive hardening and confinement dependent compressive behavior.
1. INTRODUCTION
It is still a challenge to formulate a constitutive model that captures damage induced anisotropy and stiffness reduction, unilateral effects due to crack closure and a transition from brittle to ductile behavior at increasing confining stress (Krajcinovic et al., 1991; Chiarelli et al., 2003). What is the most appropriate way to express the free energy so that the direction dependence of crack inception and propagation can be captured? How to define the anisotropic damage variable to ensure straightforward physical interpretation and efficient computation: a second order or fourth order damage tensor (Leckie et al., 1981), or discrete crack densities (Jin & Arson, 2017)? How to address the salient material behavior differences between compressive and tensile loading (Lubarda et al., 1994; Comi & Perego, 2001)? In the case of stain softening behavior, what are the best techniques to regularize localization problems: the crack band theory (Bazant & Oh, 1983), the strain gradient (Geers et al., 1998) or an integration based nonlocal approach (Pijaudier-Cabot & Bazant, 1987)?|","Document Type

N., Baker Hughes","|ABSTRACT: In cases where stresses are as high as the tensile strength, rock behaviour cannot be explained by the classical theory of continuum in a heterogeneous rock structure. In particular, rock fracturing may be accompanied by zonal disintegration of the formation.
The key to building the non-classic model of rock fracturing is a structure with grain boundaries. Deformations of solid bodies with microscopic flaws can be described within the scope of non-Euclidean geometry, where non-trivial deformation incompatibility can be referred to as a fracture parameter.
The new continuum model [1, 2] presented in this paper enables prediction of the fractured zones that are initializing and developing as a periodic structure. The non-Euclidean description of the phenomenon leads to the appearance of two unusual material constants that, by analogy with classic model, can be called “inelastic” moduli. The coupled model must comprise the fourth-order parabolic equation on disintegration thermodynamic parameter to be solved with the classical hyperbolic system of equations for the continuous medium dynamics.
In the classic approach to the rock cutting problem, it is difficult to predict a chip size because the failure criterion is beyond the model, while the suggested non-Euclidean model enables such a prediction [3].
In this paper, a dynamic non-Euclidean model of zonal disintegration is applied to rock cutting analysis to determine the lateral and axial cutting forces and their dependence on cutter velocity and depth of cut.
1. INTRODUCTION
An important aspect of rock fracturing while drilling with PDC bits is the distance from a bit center to the center of a cutter. A slight change in this distance significantly affects the linear velocities for the cutter. Figure 1 shows that the cutters’ linear velocities vary greatly for a given bit profile.
This reality raises the issue of how the cutter velocity affects the cutting forces and how the cutter velocity differences affect bit dynamics. Under the common approach, the force applied to a single cutter depends on its area of cut and back rake as well as the material parameters of rock and environment conditions such as pressure [4]. The factor of linear velocity, when calculating axial and lateral cutting forces, is neglected.|","Document Type

Strength formulas have been very effective within the coal industry because they have a better representation of the rock mass strength (sample sizes > standard sizes) and large databases of case histories providing sufficient statistical representation of both stable and failed cases. Additionally, coal pillars generally have larger width to height ratio (>1) which decreases the influence of through going structure. This is opposite for hard rock mine where the width to height ratio is generally <2 and as small as 0.3, were structure can have a major influence on the stability. Additionally, the small size of hard rock unconfined compressive strength samples does not represent the strength of the rock mass, without additional considerations. Therefore, an improved strength formula is proposed that includes the influences of rock mass strength and discontinuities. This proposed strength formula, and its associated factors (length effect, and discontinuity dip and properties) can be used to create site specific empirical design charts.
1. INTRODUCTION
Following the Coalbrook Colliery pillar collapse disaster in 1960, there has been an increased need to improve pillar design. Since the disaster, many authors have contributed to developing/improving strength formulas (Eq. 1) and empirical design charts. Martin and Maybee (2000) and Oke and Kalenchuk (2017) provide excellent summaries of these empirical strength formulas and design charts. Martin and Maybee (2000) also provide some insight on pillar strength through their result of continuum numerical modelling However, these methods, do not consider specific failure mechanisms (i.e. structural vs. stress) or do not have the same failure definition (i.e. functional/serviceability vs. collapse). The need to consider structural failure mechanisms was addressed in a strength formula for limestone pillars (Esterhuizen et. al 2008a), but the empirically based procedure is applicable to limestone mines in the United States only (based on the dataset). Continuum numerical modelling can capture structural failure mechanisms by ubiquitous joint constitutive behaviour, however, individual governing structures (e.g. discrete joints) are not explicitly simulated. Continuum models can provide insight into the amount of expected yield. Depending on the amount (depth) of yield, the pillar may be expected to collapse or it may be expected to meet serviceability thresholds. Even though an empirical technique may work for the given case with very similar situations, Oke and Kalenchuk (2017), and Malan and Napier (2011)) conclude that neither empirical techniques nor numerical modelling can be used solely to provide a solid basis to predict pillar strength, <U+03C3>p.|","Document Type

The rationale for the contribution is the interest in quantifying the impact of mechanical anisotropy in practical industrial applications such as the prediction of mechanical behavior of hydrocarbon reservoirs during depletion or injection. The onset of yielding can have profound impact on flow and elastic properties, and it is still unclear to what extent anisotropy may affect those predictions. After recalling an extensive mechanical data set obtained previously on samples of Rothbach sandstone, we define our modeling strategy using other experimental and theoretical work from the literature. This results in the necessity of determining what an appropriate isotropic yield envelope might be. We propose an approach whereby isotropic and anisotropic models are defined and parametrized sequentially. We obtain a consistent framework where the microstructural controls on strength, including anisotropy, may be understood better than previously, allowing the revisiting of legacy data sets as well as the designing of better informed geomechanical testing programs in core analysis.
1. INTRODUCTION
Mechanical anisotropy is known to adversely affect strength predictions, especially when associated with the presence of weak layers [1-3], which can result in unexpected borehole failure. In homogeneous materials, anisotropy has been showed to directly affect the shape of yield surfaces [4-7] and can also cause the strain field to be oblique to the macroscopic stress tensor. In this latter case, an important question to be answered is to what extent mechanical anisotropy should be incorporated into geomechanical models, and how does it ultimately compare with work that has been done on the effect of true triaxial states of stress [8].
The present paper builds on an extended petrophysical and mechanical data set that was acquired over the years in the Rothbach sandstone, a Triassic 20% porosity cross-bedded fluvial sandstone belonging to the Buntsandstein Formation in Northern Europe [4; 9-16]. The Rothbach sandstone is anisotropic with respect to key physical properties such as permeability, acoustic velocities and mechanical strength. As far as mechanical strength is concerned, this sandstone presents the particularity of being stronger when loaded perpendicular to the bedding, and its bedding plane does not appear to constitute a plane of weakness when favorably oriented with respect to the maximum compressive stress. Samples cored at 45 degrees to the bedding exhibit intermediate strength with respect to the ones cored parallel and perpendicular to it [4].|","Document Type

J., University of Alberta","|ABSTRACT: Solvent steam co-injection in oil sands reservoirs is generally understood to be superior to SAGD in terms of oil recovery rate, ultimate oil recovery and steam oil ratio. In solvent assisted SAGD (SA-SAGD), the combination of temperature distribution and solvent concentration profiles ahead of the steam chamber edge reduces the virgin bitumen viscosity and therefore has major control over oil drainage rate in the mobile zone. Recent coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulation results from Abbasi Asl and Chalaturnyk (2016) revealed that these profiles could be significantly influenced by the shear dilation/volume change that is induced around the chamber edge. A complete understanding of the interplay between solvent transport, heat transfer, solvent-oil phase behavior and shear induced volume change and associated sensitivities requires an analytical study which is currently lacking in the literature.
This research presents the result of a semi-analytical study to examine the conditions under which the induced volume change beyond the steam chamber edge could impact SA-SAGD performance and process design such as: optimum solvent selection and required injection volumes. Simplifications had to be made in order to allow us to solve the complex interaction of energy, mass transfer and rock property alterations around the steam chamber edge, while preserving the fundamental physics.
Single component solvent co-injection cases were considered and the corresponding phase behavior calculations were performed to yield solvent concentration and temperature at the steam chamber edge. Assuming 1-D heat conduction and pressure diffusion perpendicular to the interface, stress and volume changes were calculated beyond the chamber edge. The resulting enhancements in compressibility and effective permeability were consequently utilized to account for the heat convection and solvent dispersion, generating the ultimate temperature and solvent concentration profiles. Darcy’s law and mass balance were eventually applied to derive oil drainage rate. Sensitivity analyses were performed on injection pressure and solvent molar concentrations at the edge.
The semi-analytical modeling results demonstrated case studies where Geomechanically induced volume changes improved effective permeability, convective heat transfer and solvent dispersion inside the mobile zone. Consequently, oil drainage rate was improved and it was found out that optimum injection scenarios shifted towards solvents with reduced concentrations. It was also shown that geomechanical processes favor heavier solvents. These findings have significant implications with regards to the economy of the process. This modeling approach provides us with an inexpensive tool to identify the reservoir and operational conditions where SA-SAGD performance could be heavily influenced by Geomechanics.|","Document Type

Recently, supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO2) has been considered as an alternative fracturing fluid to water. Previous Sc-CO2 fracturing experiments suggest that, in the short-term during stimulation, Sc-CO2 may create rougher fracture surfaces and more complex fracture networks due to its low viscosity, high diffusivity and low interfacial tension. However, post-stimulation, the remnant CO2 may react with native water in the shale to create carbonic acid. This in turn may impact long-term permeability evolution in the reservoir. We report experimental observations of permeation of carbonic acid of varied acidic potential (pH) to investigate hydro-mechanical-chemical effects on fracture permeability evolution under various stress states. Surface profilometry and SEM-EDS are employed to quantify the evolution in both roughness on, and chemical constituents within, the fracture surface. Results indicate that, after 12-hours of fluid flow, fracture apertures reduce by ~18.76% with distilled water (pH=7.0), ~9.80% at pH=6.0 and increase by between ~6.30% (pH=5.0) and ~23.64% (pH=4.0) as acidity is further increased. The evolution of roughness and transformation of chemical elements on the fracture surface are in accordance with the evolution of permeability. The experimental observations imply that, CO2-rich aqueous fluids have significant impact on the evolution of fracture permeability and may influence (and increase) shale gas production. However, the observed response reflects the impact of both the removal of bridging asperities (low acidity) and in enhancing free-face dissolution (high acidity) in a complex and enigmatic fashion.
1. INTRODUCTION
As the main channels for gas and oil transport, hydraulic fracturing induced fracture characteristics directly affect gas or oil production (Scanlon et al.,2014). Fracture surfaces with different fracture roughness and complexity are induced by different fracturing fluids (water, Sc-CO2) in Longmaxi shale (Zhang et al., 2016; Zhou and Burbey, 2014). However, hydraulic fracturing has a long-term component, featuring long-term fluid-rock interaction. After fractures and channels are created, these fractures become the main conduits for fluid flow - for the fracturing fluid, methane or oil. Hence, after Sc-CO2 fracturing treatment, the remnant CO2 may react with native water in the shale to create carbonic acid, which may impact long-term permeability evolution in the reservoir.|","Document Type

These shear deformations, controlled by frictional strength and stability, may lead to different shear permeability evolutions. Previous studies have explored frictional stability-permeability relationships of carbonate-rich and phyllosilicate-rich samples during shear deformation, suggesting that phyllosilicate-rich shale has a lower frictional strength, but higher frictional stability and larger permeability reduction than that of carbonate-rich shale. This qualitative result is sufficient to identify the role of individual mineral group (i.e., tectosilicate, carbonate, and phyllosilicate) in prompting this response. Indeed, it is still uncertain whether or not a quantitative relationship of frictional stability-permeability relationships of fractures exists. In this study, we perform a series of hydroshearing experiments on saw-cut fractures of natural rocks (Green River shale, Opalinus shale, Longmaxi shale, Tournemire shale, Marcellus shale, and Newberry tuff) with distinct mineralogical compositions to understand the frictional stability-permeability relationships with respect to individual mineral groups. Our experimental results indicate that permeability change increases non-linearly with frictional strength while decreases non-linearly with frictional stability. These relationships imply that clay-rich fractures may be easily reactivated with aseismic deformation due to low frictional strength and high frictional stability, meanwhile, the permeability may decline due to clay swelling and wear product compaction. On the contrary, tectosilicate-rich fractures show the opposite trend. These results are significant for providing valuable references for understanding how permeability evolves in engineering activities like shale reservoir stimulation and CO2 caprock integrity evaluation.
1. INTRODUCTION
The stimulation of shale gas reservoir, of enhanced geothermal system (EGS), and the long term geological sequestration of CO2 involve massive fluid injection, which may reactivate pre-existing faults and fractures by hydroshearing and induce seismicity as seismic slip, slow slip and aseismic slip (Cornet et al., 1997; Zoback et al., 2012; Guglielmi et al., 2015b; Fang et al., 2016). A number of in-situ observations show that these deformations may affect the transport characteristics of the reservoir formation. For example, rapid flow at seismogenic depths is observed in IODP drill holes on the Cascadia margin (Davis et al., 1995). In-situ experiments show permeability enhancement that are associated with small dilatant slip event in reactivation of both Tournemire shale and carbonate faults (Guglielmi et al., 2015a, 2015b). At laboratory scale, experimental observations indicate that when a fracture slips, permeability may increase due to significant dilation or decrease as a result of progressive formation of gouge (Barton et al., 1985; Faoro et al., 2009). These relationships between fluid flow and fault slip pose a ubiquitous question in understanding how fault permeability evolves during fault movement, which would further provide significant insight of how fluids may be trapped by seal layers, how hydrocarbons may migrate within fractures, and how integrity of seal system may lose or enhance.|","Document Type

We report the experimental investigation carried out to capture the true triaxial stress effect on the deformation and flow behavior in Berea sandstone core samples utilizing coupled measurements of stress, deformation, ultrasonic wave propagation properties, and permeability. Through octahedral normal stresses and shear stress cycling at various values of the nondimensional stress parameter b, defined as b = (<U+03C3>2 – <U+03C3>3)/(<U+03C3>1 – <U+03C3>3), the effects stress-induced anisotropy on deformation and permeability was observed to be consistent with expected microstructural changes related to the opening/closing of microfractures due to the change in shear stress magnitude. Changes in b signify the relative magnitude of intermediate principal stress to maximum and minimum stresses, which was determined to influence the mechanical properties of the formation in both dry and water-saturated conditions. The permeability obtained the axial direction increases with increasing axial loading and decreases with radial loading.
1. INTRODUCTION
Stress-induced anisotropy of reservoir geomechanical properties is essential from drilling risk reduction to wellpath and reservoir productivity optimization. Borehole stability, completion type selection, hydraulic fracturing design and optimization, and production operations all require accurate determination of stress alterations and associated changes in geomechanical, acoustic and petrophysical properties of reservoir formations. Current attempts to capture the effect of stress state on formation geomechanical characteristics typically consist of conventional triaxial testing of core samples that often cannot portray the true stress state around the wellbore and within the reservoir.
There is very limited experimental research on the stress-induced anisotropy of various formation geomechanical properties under true triaxial stress state since in these tests, concentration is on exploring failure characteristics of rocks. Sedimentary rocks have a wide range of variations in microstructure along with various minerals and organic matter. To obtain reliable data used for modeling hydromechanical behavior of rocks, rock samples need to be tested by simulating their in-situ conditions. Structural anisotropy causes anisotropy in rock hydromechanical properties. Further anisotropy is induced with anisotropic stress states. However, conventional triaxial testing is insufficient in terms of stress state reproducibility. True triaxial testing is the advancement of triaxial testing capable of simulating more realistic stress states by controlling the intermediate principal stress. With independent manipulation of three principal stresses and measurements of coupled changes in deformation, acoustic properties, permeability, resistivity, and other anisotropic properties as response to various stress scenarios using a single cylindrical core sample, it is possible to investigate the changes a formation will experience throughout the lifecycle of operations.|","Document Type

Long-term stability analysis was performed with PHASE 2 v.8.01 finite element program and shear strength reduction method was utilized. Dam behavior was examined under static loading conditions by considering the different ponded water levels and slime-sand boundary positions.

While acoustic waves are purely elastic, quasi-static mechanical tests usually induce non-elastic deformations. A model introduced by Fj<U+00E6>r et al., 2013 allows to quantify non-elastic contributions as a function of stress-variation amplitude and hence to determine the purely elastic stiffness from a standard rock mechanical test. However, due to experimental constraints it was not clear if the model would be valid down to strain amplitudes of acoustic waves. We have performed an experiment on undrained, water-saturated Castlegate sandstone, combining a quasi-static triaxial test with force-oscillation measurements at seismic frequency in order to investigate stress/strain amplitude-related non-elastic effects. We have found that inelastic effects are activated for strains as small as 10<U+2212>6 (<U+03BC>strain), and that the compliance increases linearly with increasing stress amplitude.
1. INTRODUCTION
The stiffness of a material is given by the ratio between stress change and strain change for a given stress path. In quasi-static tests, stiffness is usually measured for strains in the order of 10<U+2212>3 (mstrain). Dynamic stiffness, on the other hand, is derived from acoustic wave velocities (at seismic, sonic, or ultrasonic frequencies), where strain amplitudes are usually smaller than 10<U+2212>6 (<U+03BC>strain). The difference in strain amplitudes is believed to be the main cause of inconsistency between static and dynamic moduli in rocks with no (or small) velocity dispersion (Hilbert Jr et al., 1994; Tutuncu et al., 1998). In dispersive rocks like shales, strain rate (frequency) effects may in addition play a significant role (Holt et al., 2012).
In this paper, we will focus on the strain amplitude effect. Winkler et al., 1979 demonstrated that for strains greater than about 10<U+2212>6, grain boundary friction mechanisms are activated. Strain amplitudes of the quasi-static stiffness measurements are much higher. Therefore, non-elastic effects may take place. Fj<U+00E6>r et al., 2011 identified two main non-elastic mechanisms during uniaxial loading/unloading paths. One mechanism - crushing of small asperities at grain contacts or crack faces - is irreversible and appears only during loading. The other mechanism - friction-controlled sliding of internal surfaces in contact - is reversible and observed during both loading and unloading. It causes hysteresis in the stress strain curve as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.|","Document Type

INTRODUCTION |Rock mass grouting is a common method to seal tunnel walls in hard rock to avoid water inflow. Cementitious grout is injected into rock during excavation with the purpose of sealing major hydraulically conductive fractures. This grouting process can represent a significant part of the tunneling cost and therefore an increased knowledge on how to achieve cost- and time- efficient grouting methods while obtaining the desired reduction in permeability, is crucial. Real-time grouting control (RTGC, Kobayashi (2008)) is a method used to actively monitor the grouting process by analyzing the real-time pumping data to assess the penetration length of the grout. In addition to grout spread, it is important to avoid hydro-jacking (dilation of existing fractures) and hydro-fracturing (creation of new fractures) because it can lead to unnecessary and excessive use of grout material and potentially compromise the integrity of the rock mass. |Besides the complexity of a fracture, or fracture network, which will be addressed later, one particular challenge in modelling the grouting process, with e.g. finite element (FE), is the large aspect ratio of the fractures: the ratio between the thickness and the lateral extent of fracture planes. Coupled problems (hydromechanical models) with complex processes (two distinctly different fluids flowing in thin fractures) of complex materials (non-Newtonian Bingham fluid) can lead to extremely computationally intensive models, making full 3D FE simulations both unfeasible and undesirable. For this reason, calculations are typically done using one-dimensional analytical and/or semi-analytical models with the inherit limitation of being approximate.|","Document Type

Conventional triaxial testing does not permit rock testing under anisotropic horizontal stresses. However, in-situ horizontal stresses are rarely isotropic, and a few studies on granitic and carbonate rocks have shown that the intermediate principal stress potentially has a very significant effect on rock strength and depends on rock type. In the case of shales and mudstones however, very little data exists on this topic due to experimental challenges involved in sample preparation and testing rock specimens under a true-triaxial state of stress. In this work, we present a series of true-triaxial tests on several shale specimens, and explore the effect of the intermediate principal stress on the failure properties of shale. Results indicate that the intermediate principal stress has a measurable contribution to rock strength, and impacts rock brittleness during the fracturing process. Failure laws of the Mogi-Coulomb form are used to predict rock strength under true-triaxial conditions, and methods to obtain true-triaxial strength parameters from conventional triaxial test data are discussed. Rock brittleness is studied as a function of minimum and intermediate principal stresses, and results indicate that increasing the intermediate principal stress may have an embrittling effect on rock.
1. INTRODUCTION
Failure criterion for rock plays an important role in analyses of various subsurface problems such as wellbore stability, stimulated volume calculations and faulting mechanics. To better understand the compressive failure behavior for rock, various failure criteria have been developed and documented in rock mechanics literature. The most famous and widely used of these is the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. However, the criterion suffers a major drawback in that it predicts rock failure solely based on the maximum and minimum principal stresses - with no strength dependency attributed to the intermediate principal stress. This is also in part due to the limitations of conventional triaxial rock testing, where the use of fluid pressure to apply a confining stress to a cylindrical test specimen inherently restricts the test conditions to the special case of equal intermediate and minimum principal stresses. Consequently, the effect of the intermediate principal stress (<U+03C3>2) has largely been ignored.|","Document Type

In this paper, based on drilling and completion data, rock damage criterion and microseismic surveillance data, and previous studies about relevant influencing factors, 2D and 3D finite element model (FEM) of casing-cement sheath-formation are established to study the mechanism of casing deformation during multi-stage volume fracturing of Z1 tight oil horizontal well. The results show: a) those factors thought by most scholars just cause the cross-section of the casing smaller change, which do not block the bridge plugs pumped by elastic coiled tubing; b) influenced by in-situ stress, natural fractures tend to slip when the stress difference is large enough, and slippage is mostly likely to happen as the angle between the natural fracture and maximum horizontal stress reaches 30° and the shear displacement is usually several centimeters; c) natural fracture slip is accompanied by drastic local casing shrinkage, with slight deformation one side and severe another, as observed from the impression blocks in oilfields. The results demonstrated in this paper can provide the theoretical basis for the prevent treatment of casing deformation failure during the fracturing reconstruction of stimulated reservoir volume of tight oil horizontal well.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing (HF) has long been used as a major technique for well stimulation. In recent years, the rapid development of unconventional resources has made the technique one step forward, especially the appearance of volume fracturing, which has produced a big influence on the increase of oil/gas production. In 2007, North America began to use the fracturing technology of muti-stage and muti-cluter in horizontal wells, and has made it become the main means of unconventional oil/gas development since then, the exploitation of Barnett shale regarded as the most representative (Parshall 2008). In China, volume fracturing has been widely applied in Sichuan’ shale area and has brought larger gas production than that by traditional fracturing technology in past several years (Chen et al. 2014). Recently, this technique also has played a great role in developing the tight oil/gas in some oilfield of Shanxi, China.|","Document Type

H., Civil and Environmental Engineering| Gutierrez, M., Civil and Environmental Engineering","|ABSTRACT: The coupling of fluid flow and deformation in deformable porous media has started to receive wide attention in rock engineering. Acknowledging this hydro-mechanical (H-M) interaction is essential for the safe design of geo-engineering structures in saturated ground. Explicit coupling techniques have been the most attractive approach to use for simulating the H-M interaction, yet, the techniques are conditionally stable and require small time steps, affecting their efficiency for long-term simulations. To remove these restrictions, an unconditionally stable alternating direction explicit (ADE) scheme could be used to solve the flow problem. However, the standard ADE scheme is only moderately accurate and is restricted to uniform grids, thus impractical for large-scale domains. This paper presents the derivation of a novel high-order ADE scheme for non-uniform grids to solve the flow problem. The flow solutions are then sequentially coupled with a geomechanical simulator in the computer code Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC). Validations based on Terzaghi’s consolidation problems show that the new sequential coupling technique reduces simulation runtimes by 40% of FLAC’s basic scheme without numerical instability and with average errors of 0.5% for pore pressure and 0.4% for displacement. The new coupling technique also results in satisfactory H-M response of a permeable tunnel under surface loading and reduces the computer runtime by 24%.
1. INTRODUCTION
Biot’s theory of poroelasticity (Biot, 1941) has been prominently employed in rock mechanics to understand the coupled response of fluid flow and deformation in deformable porous media (i.e., soils and rocks). Acknowledging this coupled hydro-mechanical (H-M) interaction is essential for the safe design of geo-engineering structures built above and under saturated ground such as embankment and tunnels. Consolidation and subsidence are the most common examples of the two-way coupled interaction in which fluid flow affects deformation and vice versa (Gutierrez and Lewis, 2002; Neuzil, 2003; Wang, 2000).|","Document Type

Y., Nanyang Technological University","|ABSTRACT: Grouting of rock fractures is an effective way to reduce or prevent water inflow during rock excavation. Prediction of the grouting process can greatly optimize the corresponding grouting progress and reduce the relevant cost. The theoretical model for grout flow between parallel plates is fundamental to 1D grouting simulation. However, large discrepancies are found between recent experimental data and results from traditional theoretical model for grouting simulation. One of the main reasons for the large discrepancy could be due to the deformation of the channel plates in the experiment. Therefore, a new model considering the coupling between grout flow and deformation of fracture channel is derived, where the fracture deformation is updated during the whole grouting process. It is found out that grouting simulation considering fracture deformation can better describe the experimental data than traditional model not considering fracture deformation.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rock masses in the field are commonly accompanied by faults, like rock fractures, which can provide perfect channels for water transportation, if they are connected to water bearing areas. Water inflow can happen if these fractures are encountered during rock excavation, and can lead to delay of engineering project, thus leading to potential economic loss and endangering safety of workers on site. Therefore, rock grouting has been long taken as an environmental friendly and cost effective method to control water seepage, compared with other methods. However, grouting design nowadays relies more on personal experiences of engineers due to lack of theoretical guidance. Therefore, development of theoretical grouting models for grouting simulation is in great need.
The first theoretical model for grout spread in fractured rock mass was proposed by Wallner (Wallner, 1976), which has been further developed by many other scholars in different aspects (Hassler, 1992a; Hassler, 1992b; Gustafson, 1996; Yang, 2002), including the consideration of filtration and bleeding during the grouting process (Eriksson, 2000; Eklund, 2008; Draganovic, 2009), the research on the penetrability of fractured rock mass (Miltiadou-Fezans, 2013; Saeidi, 2013; Rafi, 2015), and the influence of properties of cement grout on grout penetration (Eriksson, 2004; Hakansoon, 1993). Recently, the influence of fracture deformation during grouting starts to attract the attention of scholars, Gothall investigated the mechanism of fracture dilation in microscale and could explain some grouting phenomena that cannot be described by models without considering fracture deformation (Gothall, 2009), and he further considered the influence of fracture deformation on nearby fractures (Gothall, 2010). Fransson considered the influence of grout pressure directly as a form of stress, which, combined with the in-situ stress, could be used to calculate the corresponding fracture deformation, thus updating the relevant fracture aperture (Fransson, 2010). Rafi also investigated the influence of aperture variation due to fluid flow on grout penetration (Rafi, 2015). However, these works did not present detailed coupling process of fracture deformation and grout penetration. Therefore, the present work derived a new model considering the deformation of fracture channel under time varying distribution of grout pressure and the relevant characteristics of grout flow in various deformed fracture channel. The simulation results obtained from two models, with and without considering the influence of fracture deformation, were compared with the relevant experimental data conducted by Fujita (Fujita, 2012).|","Document Type

A three-dimensional finite element model is developed to investigate the effect of chemical and thermal osmosis on pore pressure and stresses in the vicinity of the wellbore wall, the model is also available for inclined well drilled in transversely isotropic formation, the results indicate that temperature and solute concentration of drilling fluid present different influence on wellbore stability: though cooling effect of drilling fluid could reduce wellbore shear failure risk by decreasing pore pressure and effective stresses, tensile fracture is easier to form in maximum principle stress direction due to sharply decreased effective compressive tangential stress. Lower solute concentration could increase pore pressure greatly by forcing drilling fluid flowing into formation under chemical potential difference, meanwhile, the developed model reveals that Young’s modulus and permeability anisotropy ratios play an important role in the pore pressure and effective stresses distribution for the directional well in transversely isotropic formation, however, the effect of Poisson’s ratio could be ignored.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wellbore instability is a universal problem in drilling operation, especially in shale formations, the direct reason is that effective stresses redistribute after the hole is drilled and shear or tensile failure criterions are satisfied. Effective stresses are determined by stresses and pore pressure according to Biot’s (1941) theory. The interaction between shale and water based drilling fluid is studied a lot by many researchers, Detournay and Cheng (1988) introduced coupled poroelastic theory to analyze the pore pressure and stresses distribution around the wellbore and the first analytic solution is given, then poroelastic theory is extended by taking into consideration thermal and chemical effects of drilling fluid and pore fluid. Palciauskas and Domenico (1982) developed thermo-poroelastic constitutive equations, Wang and Papamichos (1994) gave analytical solutions. Ekbote and Abousleiman, (2006), Ghassemi et al. (1999), Ghassemi and Diek (2003) investigated fully coupled chemo-poroelastic problem by extending Detournay’s work and eventually obtained analytical solutions that are suitable for isotropic and transversely isotropic formations. Combined thermal and chemical effects on wellbore stability were studied further, Ekbote (2002), Tao and Ghassemi (2006) presented fully coupled thermo-chemo-poroelastic theory, though analytical solutions were given by researchers, the result is only suitable for isotropic formation or the hole that is vertical with the transverse formation plane, so numerical methods were used to analyze poroelastic problems, Cui et al. (1996) used finite element method to analyze pore pressure and stress distribution around directional well in anisotropic formation based on poroelasticity. Ghassemi and Zhang (2004) applied the boundary element method to study poroelastic problem. Gomar et al. (2014), Roshan and Aghighi (2012) established a 2D (two-dimensional) FEM model based on the thermo-poroelastic and chemo-poroelastic theory separately, Zhou and Ghassemi (2009) presented a 2D finite element model based on nonlinear chemo-poro-thermoelasticity for isotropic formation.|","Document Type

Previous studies have documented some of the occurrences at such facilities and assessed leakage or failure mechanisms along with their degree of severity, in part to inform risk-based assessments of subsurface geologic storage of fuels and wastes (such as carbon dioxide). This paper summarizes the past occurrences and several hundred others of varying severity (from nuisance/non-hazardous to catastrophic), that have occurred or earlier ones that have come to light since a previous study of Evans [1] was undertaken. Worldwide, these have occurred at facilities developed in salt cavern (~320), porous rocks (aquifer and depleted hydrocarbon field – ~40 and ~600 respectively), mined hard-rock cavern (~50) and storage facilities of as-yet to be determined type (~7). The present work includes categorizing the fuel type (natural gas, LPG, NGL’s, crude oil), type, nature and severity of any leakage for both above ground and subsurface incidents, all of which provide key parameters to risk probability assessments.
Worldwide, a total of 1023 occurrences at underground fuel storage facilities are documented, of which 706 involve natural gas facilities. Of these, 63% can be attributed to subsurface causes (38% to well integrity, 25% to geological or subsurface integrity causes) and 36% to surface causes including pipeline and wellhead issues. It is important to note that not all involve product loss: only 588 occurrences are linked with migration or leakage of product, of which only 428 occurred to, or at, the surface. Together, the 1023 occurrences provide evidence of problems that do occur and which could contribute to a more serious occurrence and thus their recognition informs risk assessments. In the US, a total of 817 occurrences are documented, of which 538 are linked to migration/leakage of product, with 397 occurrences to, or at, the surface. Some 599 occurrences involved natural gas facilities. Of these, 59% can be attributed to subsurface causes (33% to well integrity, 26% to geological or subsurface integrity causes) and 38% to surface causes. In the US, the highest numbers of occurrences are found in California, Pennsylvania, and Texas, with product losses and related issues occurring in depleted oil and gas fields and in solution-mined salt cavern facilities.|","Document Type

Specific energy is usually used to evaluate the drilling performance, which is defined as the amount of energy required to remove a unit volume of rock. In this paper, a mathematical model for specific energy of thermal spallation is proposed. Thermal spallation experiments are carried out with granite, shale, and red sandstone. Main parameters in proposed specific energy model are measured to calculate the corresponding specific energy. Results show that under high temperature, the granite and shale can be induced to spall, while the red sandstone only fuses on the surface. For granite and shale, specific energy is small and close to their compressive strengths, which indicates that thermal spallation is suitable for heterogeneous hard rocks and is of high rock breaking efficiency. Moreover, for granite, the specific energy of thermal spallation is much smaller than that of other rock breaking methods in previous work, including mechanical bit, high pressure water jet, supercritical carbon dioxide jet and high power laser, which reveals that rock thermal spallation method is of high energy utilization and drilling efficiency.
1. INTRODUCTION
The quantities of energy resources, including oil, gas and geothermal energy, are pretty large in the deep formations (Dyman et al., 2002; Tester et al., 2006), where the rocks are too hard and difficult to be broken. Hence, it is necessary to develop a highly effective drilling method to promote the exploration and development of deep resources.
High temperature thermal spallation may have been man's first non-manual mining method. However, thermal spallation was not be developed until the 1940s when the Linde Air Products Division of Union Carbide started developing it for use in mining taconite ore (Williams, 1986). Thermal spallation is a non-contact rock-breaking method, in which the surface of a rock is rapidly heated to induce small flakes or spalls. It is expected to provide an alternative way for high efficiency drilling in deep formation. In recent years, the method has been developed rapidly, and become the research focus of most countries and research institutions. Researchers of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and their partners proposed the fluid thermal spallation method, and applied for a patent (Potter and Tester, 1995). Swiss Federal Institute of technology in Zurich (ETH) began to research the flow field of fluid thermal spallation and develop the experimental device since 2000, and it made some progress in the field of temperature distribution characteristics (Martin et al., 2013; Stathopoulos et al., 2013; Jackson, 2013; Rothenfluh et al., 2013; Rothenfluh et al., 2013; Stathopoulos et al., 2012). So far, the existing thermal spallation drilling experiments showed that the speed of the method could be up to 15ft/h-30ft/h (Augustine, 2009), which was many times faster than conventional drilling methods. Thus, thermal spallation drilling has broad application prospect and needs to be further studied.|","drilling efficiency, Thermal spallation,  fusion,  specific energy"

The objective of this study is to separate the effect of temperature and fluid medium on hard sandstone drilling parameters, which include the weight of bit (WOB), torque and mechanical specific energy (MSE). A series of rock drilling experiments was carried out. The results was very interesting that liquid nitrogen (LN2) cause the sandstone more difficult to drill than air and water, which is contrary to the view that the differential temperature between low temperature fluid and the rock enhance the rock failure. LN2 caused the average MSE to be increased by about 20.64%, water caused the average MSE to be reduced by about 42.66%, compared with dry drilling. From the results, it can be concluded that the temperature has no significant effect on hard sandstone drilling parameters and fluid medium type affect the parameters remarkably in the range of 20-300°C. This phenomena maybe attribute to that water caused the surface free energy of new cuttings surface reduced and LN2 caused the surface energy increased compared with air.
1. INREODUCTION
The effect of temperature and fluid medium on rock's failure and deformation is important in many engineering applications such as radioactive waste disposal, freezing and thawing cycles of rock, underground resource development, geotechnical engineering, rock weathering, and so on. Temperature and fluid affect the rock properties is an unavoidable problem in drilling engineering. For instance, underbalanced drilling has been widely applied and researched by virtue of high drilling rate (George et al., 1956; Cppper et al., 1977; Negrao et al., 1997; Fattah et al., 2011). Through field verification, the rate of gas drilling is usually over 10 times higher than conventional drilling with liquid fluid. The effect of bottom pressure on rock failure seems to explain the extremely high rate of penetration in drilling (Sheffield and Sitzman, 1985), but the effect of temperature and medium on rock's failure seemed also can’t be neglected (Li et al., 2014). Drilling is a complex physical and chemical process involving multi-field and multi-media coupling, such as mechanical field, temperature field, flow field, etc. The thermal impact assisted rock failure has been a hot topic in the past decades. Some scholars (Zhang et al.,2014; Guo and Ghalambor, 2002) believe that the temperature difference between the gas and the formation causes tensile stress in the rock, promote the rock fragmentation in gas drilling. As the differential thermal expansion of mineral grains subjected to elevated temperature induced microcracks, which decrease drillability and enhance the penetration rate (Karfakis, 1985). But the research result of Zhou (2003) indicated that the effect of formation temperature on the properties of reservoir rocks of this area should be neglected. Due to underground invisibility and environmental complexity, the effect of temperature on rock failure at the well bottom is still not fully understood.|","Document Type

When conventional support systems such as rock bolts, shotcrete, wire mesh, steel frames and lattice girders cannot provide sufficient support for tunnels, using pre-reinforcement systems becomes necessary in addition to main support systems. Pre-reinforcement of weak ground is done before the excavation or ahead of advancing the tunnel. This will provide a safe and effective operation. Pipe roofing umbrella arch pre-reinforcement method is one of the conventional pre-reinforcement systems that can be implemented in tunnels, caverns and other infrastructures construction. Detailed 3D numerical simulations are useful tools to obtain a better understanding of the performance of a pre-reinforcement system. In this paper, sectional excavation of tunnel No.10 of the Ghazvin-Rasht Railroad is simulated with FLAC3D code by using pipe roofing pre-reinforcement method, side bolts and pipes, and initial support system. The results of numerical simulations are analyzed by using tunnel support interaction charts. Considering all technical parameters, pipes with 4 in diameter, 15 cm spacing and 5 degree installation angle is selected as the most appropriate pipe roofing method for this tunnel.
1. INTRODUCTION
Tunneling in soft or weak ground may encounter many operational and safety problems. Under these conditions extra attention and field investigations will be required. When rock mass cannot be self-supporting, or when conventional support systems such as rock bolt, shotcrete, wire mesh, steel frame or lattice girder cannot provide sufficient support for a tunnel, using secondary support systems or pre-reinforcing become necessary. Furthermore, in urban areas shallow tunnels are often constructed adjacent to existing structures such as buildings, streets and railways (Funatsu et al., 2008). The possibility of tunnel induced displacements and subsidence that can damage the existing structures is very high. In order to minimize effects of tunneling on existing structures, engineers should pay special attention to ground displacements. Therefore, using efficient and proper support system is necessary with considerations of the project requirements and constraints such as amounts of settlements and displacements. Often, it is required to use secondary support systems or pre-reinforcing in addition to primary support system in order to ensure a safe working place during the tunnel excavation. It is obvious that if effective support system is not installed at proper time and place, tunnel will collapse and may cause extensive damage, resulting financial and human loss in the project.|","Document Type

From similar studies of the South American plate in Brazil’s Potiguar basin, it is found that intraplate seismicity occurs at uplifted basin borders (areas over thin, hot, weaker lithosphere) where pre-existing faults are prone to be reactivated by small pressure perturbations. Conversely, central basins (areas over thick, cold, strong lithosphere) are not prone to seismicity. With this model we investigate Oklahoma (Ok) and North Dakota (ND), both intense areas of injection. ND activity, in the central basin, shows no induced seismicity. In contrast, Ok activity, in a regional-scale ravine in the uplifted basin border, has seen a 62.5-fold increase in recent seismicity. Modeling of the Ok region shows reactivation of pre-existing faults with injection pressures of 1.75 MPa (254 psi; 0.7ppg) between 2000-2200m depths, values that agree with wellhead injection pressure field data.
1. INTRODUCTION: THE PROBLEM
A huge increase of seismicity in the tectonically stable U.S. is put into evidence, if we examine the USGS Catalog, 2017 comparing the number of earthquakes of magnitude (Mw) greater or equal to 4 that occurred during 2000-2010 and 2010-2016. For this area, see Fig. 1, we jumped from an average of 6.2 events/yr, during 2000-2010, to an average of 28.8 events/yr, during 2010-2016, roughly a 5-fold increase. For Oklahoma, see Fig. 2, a 62.5-fold increase of seismicity has been observed when comparing these same two periods, including two major events (Mw 5.7, 2011; Mw 5.8, 2016). These recent increases are contemporaneous with the increase in shale production as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In the stable midcontinent, a roughly 5-fold increase is observed in seismicity during 2010-2016. Again, the increase is contemporaneous with US shale production.|","Document Type

T., Curtin University| Joodi, B., Curtin University| Nourifard, N., Curtin University| Sarmadivaleh, M., Curtin University| Younessi, A., Geoscience & Petroleum Engineering","|ABSTRACT: It is well-known that the risk of sanding varies for different completion systems, i.e. open hole versus cased and perforation, in a given wellbore and reservoir. Part of this difference comes from the scale effect of the borehole. Pragmatic approaches are usually taken to consider the borehole scale effect in the sand production prediction analysis. A more rigorous approach is needed to take this effect into account.
Experiments have been conducted by researchers on thick-walled cylinder (TWC) samples with different inner to outer diameter ratios (ID/OD) for samples of standard dimensions (1.5 in ID, and 3 in length) to investigate the scale effect on the borehole failure. However, the results partially suffer from the outer boundary effect of the tests and may not purely represent the effects of the inner borehole scale. Here in this paper, the outer boundary effects of TWC experiments were distinguished from the inner borehole scale effect using analytical approaches followed by extensive laboratory experiments. The methodology involves computation and comparison of failure from different criteria (i.e. Mohr-Coulomb, Drucker-Prager, Mogi and Modified Lade) from Tehrani’s results (2016). Then, the volumetric strain was formulated against confining pressure to explain the elastic, elastic-plastic, and plastic behaviour of the rock.
Variation of the TWC strength of samples with different inner borehole sizes may not be fully captured by the analytical approach, which only considers the effect of the ID/OD. Hence, the differences between the analytical and experimental approaches can be considered as the inner borehole scale effect. As expected, the analysis showed that the size of the inner borehole and the outer boundaries significantly change the TWC strength. Surprisingly, the effect of the samples’ OD was obvious, regardless of the corresponding ID. After distinguishing the outer boundary effects, the results show a decreasing trend between the inner borehole size and the TWC strength of the sample, which can be considered as the borehole scale effect.|","Sand Production,  Volumetric Strain,  Borehole Scale Effect, Thick-Walled Cylinder"

Besides, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) fluid is characterized by low rock breaking threshold pressure and high rock breaking rate. This paper proposes a new type of jet, called swirling-round SC-CO2 jet. Rock breaking mechanism of swirling-round SC-CO2 jet is studied by means of rock-erosion experiment and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. Standard cylinder sandstone cores were used for rock erosion experiment. Then, slices were cut off from these rock samples for SEM observation. Results show that the jet penetration efficiency of swirling-round SC-CO2 jet is higher than that of round SC-CO2 jet. SEM observation presents: numerous crystal particles are snapped; inter-crystalline rupture occurs, generating large number of micro fractures; shear failure of crystal particles appear widely. Therefore, the major rock breaking mechanisms of swirling-round SC-CO2 jet are tensile and shear failure, while the breaking mechanism of round SC-CO2 jet is tensile failure. For one thing, swirling-round SC-CO2 breaks rock by combining axial impinging, radial tension and circumferential shear. For another, with characteristics of low viscosity, compressibility, strong diffusivity and permeability, numerous micro-fractures are caused by SC-CO2, and the existed fractures are expanded, led to fractures joining together and massive rocks split off.
1. INTRODUCTION
When the temperature is above 304 K and the pressure is above 7.38 MPa, CO2 will change into the supercritical state. It is a kind of non-gaseous, non-liquid, non-solid CO2 with many unique physical and chemical properties (H Wang et al., 2015). Supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) is with density similar to that of a liquid and viscosity comparable to a gas (Gupta et al., 2005).
A new drilling method by SC-CO2 jet was proposed in recent years (J. J. Kolle, 2000; J J Kolle, 2002; Shen et al., 2010). SC-CO2 jet has already been approved to reserve low rock threshold pressure and high penetration rate with comparison of water jet and has good application prospects (Du et al., 2012; J. J. Kolle, 2000; H Wang et al., 2015). R-h WANG et al. (2014)R-h WANG et al. (2014)R-h WANG et al. (2014)R-h WANG et al. (2014) experimentally simulated the distributions of pressure and temperature on the bottom of the hole during the SC-CO2 jet drilling. Results show that the bottom hole temperature and pressure increases with the increase of the nozzle diameter, the jet length has an optimum value, and the increase of the inlet pressure has a positive effect on the drilling rate. Gupta et al. (2005) analyzed the feasibility of SC-CO2 in deep underbalanced drilling operations. It shows that SC-CO2 has the necessary density in the tubing to turn the downhole motor and the necessary density and viscosity to maintain underbalanced conditions in the annulus. Long et al. (2016) numerically investigated the impinging flow field in the bottom hole during drilling with SC-CO2. Results show that the inlet temperature will increase the axial velocity but will slightly reduce both the mass flow rate and the impact of the carbon dioxide jet; an increase in the inlet pressure not only increase the mass flow rate and the dynamic pressure of the supercritical carbon dioxide jet but also increase both the pressure gradient and the temperature gradient along the impinging wall which are beneficial to the jet-assisted drilling process. Z Wang et al. (2016) established a phase state prediction model during carbon dioxide drilling, showing that variations in the flow work affect the temperature field of the SC-CO2 fluid significantly.|","Document Type

We developed an analytical model for determining the fracture initiation pressure (FIP), location of rock failure zones, and initial fracture direction from radial lateral borehole. Then, we analyze effects of in-situ stress regime, lateral orientation and pre-existing weakness plane. Results show that in-situ stress regime, lateral orientation and weakness plane greatly influence FIP, location of rock failure zones, and initial fracture direction. For a given combination of in-situ stress regime and lateral orientation, when fracture initiates longitudinally, FIP enlarges moderately with lateral orientation increasing; rock failure zones consist of two symmetric wings at the base of radial borehole on its top and bottom sides. When fracture initiates horizontally, FIP declines moderately with lateral orientation increasing; rock failure zones consist of two symmetric wings on the remote region of radial borehole on its two lateral sides. Fracture will firstly initiate from the weakness plane, if its tensile or shear failure pressure is less than that FIP from rock matrix.
1. INTRODUCTION
Radial drilling is a technology that is able to make a right turn in a cased wellbore (vertical, slanted, or horizontal well) and then penetrate some distance out into the formation (Balch et al., 2016; W Dickinson and Dickinson, 1985; Wade Dickinson et al., 1993). The drilling tools can be high-pressure water jet, called radial-jet-drilling (RJD) (Wang et al., 2016), as well as mechanical drill bit (Balch et al., 2016). The formed radial laterals, with radius of 20-50 mm and length of 10-100 m, distributing in one layer or multiple layers, can penetrate the near well damage zone, communicate with the formation far from the main well (Cinelli and Kamel, 2013; Ragab, 2013), avoid fluid invasion damage during hydraulic fracturing (Ren et al., 2016) and increase productivity with low cost.|","Document Type

Due to the difficulty of migrating proppant deep into the reservoir, a large number of fractures with little or no proppant placement would form after the treatment, acting as main flow paths for gas production. And the sharp production rate decline after a period of production is considered as the result of closure of this kind of fractures. First a summary of the research on the deformation of natural fractures and shale creep behavior is given. Then a simplified numerical non-propped fracture model is established to simulate the fracture closure under normal stress, which consists of the elastic deformation caused by pressure drop in fractures and the deformation caused by formation creep behavior. The results of the simulation show that, the fracture closure caused by creep is too large to be ignored. The fracture deformation under the conditions of different normal stress and surface contact area is also studied in the paper.
1. INTRODUCTION
To achieve maximum stimulated reservoir volume, the fracturing technique which employs low-viscosity slickwater as fracturing fluid has been widely utilized in shale gas reservoirs around the world. The initial production rate of shale gas reservoirs is largely boosted benefiting from the complex fracture network created after the treatment. However, an unexpected production decline would usually occur at the early exploitation stage of the reservoir (Almasoodi et al., 2014). Although the reason for this is still not fully understood, the closure of hydraulic fractures under the in-situ stress acting normal to the plane of fracture is believed to be one of the main causes (Kamali and Pournik, 2015). On the other hand, due to the poor proppant migration ability of slickwater and the intrinsic tight characteristic of shale gas reservoirs, many fractures with no proppant placement would be created after the hydraulic fracturing treatment, acting as main flow paths for gas production (Mayerhofer et al., 1997). Hence, the deformation and conductivity change of non-propped fractures under normal stress are studied in this paper.|","Document Type

The research is primarily focused on the effect of valve ports on the generation frequency and characteristics of drilling fluid continuous wave signal. Valve ports distribution is designed as multi-row along the axis and several along the circumference. Furthermore, a mathematical model is built to calculate the parameters of the valve port distribution. The results show the correlation coefficient between the ideal sinusoidal pressure wave and the pressure wave generated by the designed valve ports (distributing 4 on per row and 3 rows along the axis) is 0.9983, and the generation frequency of the pressure wave is up to 20 bit/s. The research indicates that the reciprocating valve equipment can improve the frequency of the pressure wave signal and has a great advantage of improving drilling efficiency.
1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, signal transmission technology of drilling fluid pressure wave is widely applied in the well drilling process (Wu, 2016 and Hou, 2016). Arps, 1964 proposed that reciprocating plunger valve device is used to generate pressure wave signal for transmitting downhole information. Klotz designed a signal generator and its main valve was reciprocating swing-type with a transmission rate of 15 bit/s (Klotz et al., 2008). Hutin introduced Schlumberger company's MWD system which used rotary valves to generate continuous pressure waves and its transmission rate was up to 10 bit/s (Hutin et al., 2001). At present, only Schlumberger company owns mature products that can generate continuous pressure waves and it has been successfully applied in field (Su and Dou, 2005). Fang has done a lot of research on the cone valve reciprocating signal generator and he designed a model of hydraulic pulser controlled by on-off pilot valve (Fang et al., 2004 and 2016). Besides, the signal characteristics produced by the pulser are simulated and analysed. Nevertheless, the pulser existed some technical problems such as low response frequency of the control valve and low frequency of positive pulse signal, leading a low drilling efficiency. The authors (Jia et al., 2012 and Wang et al., 2011) detailedly studied the mechanism of generating drilling fluid continuous pressure wave based on the rotary valve signal generator. However, the distribution space of the valve port was limited by the radial dimension of drill string on account of the through flow valve port of rotary valve formed on the stator and rotor blades. Besides, the valve port resulted in insufficient supply capacity for the generator. Furthermore, when the drilling fluid flow through the valve ports the main bearings bear a greater axial force, eventually seriously effecting the pulser's operation stability and service life. In order to solve the above problems, author design a novel reciprocating valve equipment which can rapidly generate drilling fluid continuous wave signal. According to build a mathematical model of calculating the valve port distribution which can produce drilling fluid continuous wave signal and design distribution of multi-row valve port on the wall of the tube, the transmission rate of drilling fluid continuous wave signal is expected to improve greatly.|","Document Type

Europe","|ABSTRACT: The effectiveness of a hydraulic fracturing technology has been primarily attributed to the geometry of the primary fracture. This concept however has been challenged particularly in low-permeability formations in which the SRV creation becomes the most important issue. Unlike the primary fracture, the area in the SRV is controlled by the fundamental geomechanics behavior of the formation and secondary fracture propagation with possible different modes, and more importantly by the induced stresses near the primary fracture. In this paper, the induced stresses near a hydraulic fracture in a pure elastic, poroelastic single and dual-porosity media are analyzed and compared in order to characterize the low-permeability, sandstone and fractured formations, respectively.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing has been widely applied in the petroleum industries effectively in the past a few decades and is showing great potential in the geothermal extraction in Hot Dry Rock (HDR) formations. A hydraulically created fracture can be used to transport oil or gas from adjacent formation far away from a wellbore and productivity can be enhanced significantly by such a fast flow channel. This process however may be compromised by the fact of that the permeability in the formation may not be improved, particularly when it can be reduced due to stress changes induced in the vicinity of the fracture created. The evaluation on the range of the Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) and the Enhanced Permeability Radius (EPR) subsequently become a critical issue in the design and development of hydraulic fracturing technology. Such an issue become increasingly important in low-permeability reservoir and naturally fractured formations, where permeability inside the formation is extremely sensitive to the stresses induced and therefore critically controlling the success of a fracturing project. In this paper a hydraulic fracture inside a naturally fractured formation is simulated. Stresses in the vicinity of the fracture and the displacement on the fracture surface are calculated. Our objective is to analyze the stresses change and their impact on the permeability inside the formation so that their ultimate role on productivity in a hydraulic fractured well can be quantified. Flow in naturally fractured aquifers is normally characterized and modeled by the well-known sugar cubic model proposed by Barenblatt et al., [1960] and Warren and Root, [1963]. Extensive studies follow by mixture theory focusing on stress-sensitivity and loosely geomechanics coupling [Wilson and Aifantis, 1982, Beskos and Aifantis, 1986, Huyakorn and Pinder, 1983, Elworth and Bai, 1992, Bai et al 1993, Nair et al. 2005] and by an alternatively conventional reservoir-geomechanics coupling model following Biot’s theory, respectively [Biot, 1941, Duguid and Lee, 1977, Vallianppan and Khalili-Naghadeh, 1990, Khalili-Naghadh and Valianppan, 1996, 1996, Chen and Teufel, 1997]. Focusing on a single phase and isothermal condition with a constant fracture-matrix transfer coefficient case, the general coupling formulations in deformable poroelastic media with dual porosity, the general numerical procedure, and stresses and deformation inside a hydraulic fracture and in the vicinity of the fracture inside the naturally fractured formation are presented.|","Document Type

J., Utrecht University","|ABSTRACT: We conduct a quantitative microstructural investigation of Slochteren sandstones recovered from the Groningen gas reservoir in the NE Netherlands, aiming to identify the micromechanical processes controlling inelastic strain accommodation. Core samples were provided by the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM), from the Stedum (SDM)-1 and Zeerijp (ZRP)-3a wells, respectively drilled before and after gas depletion in 1965 and 2015. Sectioned samples were imaged using a scanning electron microscope for constructing section-scale, backscattered electron micrograph mosaics, which were interpreted by manual grain tracing and image processing to obtain digital phase and crack maps. Digitization of the sandstone microstructure in this way yields data on grain mineralogy, shape, (contact) size and orientation, as well as on coordination number and crack density and orientation. We investigated ways to improve the microstructural digitization method, including preparation of thin sections using Au vapor deposition, injection of copper sulphate (CuSO4) at elevated pressure, and etching using hydrogen fluoride (HF). Finally, an image analysis method was developed to enable semi-automatic phase/ crack mapping, which we first applied to a layered sample from the ZRP-3a core. Comparison of phase/ crack maps of layered sandstone samples may provide the key to help identify the processes controlling pore pressure depletion-induced compaction.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydrocarbon production causes changes in the effective stress state of the reservoir rock, frequently leading to compaction (Geertsma, 1957; Segall and Fitzgerald, 1998; Hettema et al., 2000) and surface subsidence (Geertsma, 1973; Nagel, 2001; Doornhof et al., 2006), causing major economic damage and social upheaval (e.g. Chan and Zoback, 2007; Muntendam-Bos and De Waal, 2015). Models predicting surface subsidence rely on constitutive relations describing compaction. Linear poroelastic compaction models are frequently insufficient (Hettema et al., 2002; van Thienen-Visser et al., 2015), suggesting that inelastic processes also play a role. An improved understanding of the strain-accommodating processes operating on the grain-scale, and how this scales to reservoir compaction, is necessary for adequate forecasting of surface subsidence.|","Document Type

The main goal of this stress measurement campaign was to estimate the magnitude and orientation of the in-situ principal stresses, to understand the variation of the minimum stress towards existing shear zones, and to estimate the jacking pressure required to open existing fractures. In this study, the effect of mini-HFs on permeability of the experimental volume has been quantified via conducting a series of low pressure (< 1 MPa) conventional hydraulic tests, such as pressure pulse and constant rate injection tests before and after each hydraulic fracturing test. The results reveal a variety of hydraulic responses for different stimulated intervals. For most of the HF intervals, the results suggest an increase in transmissivity of up to two orders of magnitude as well as an increase of the non-integer flow dimension. The hydraulic results were then compared with micro-seismicity measurements during each HF test in order to link the hydraulic response to the extension and geometry of the stimulated volume obtained from microseismic clouds. The number of seismic events was found to correlate well with the injected volume and permeability enhancement. This comparison also suggests that the geometry of the stimulated volume as inferred from hydraulic test methods is consistent with the volume inferred from microseismicity.
1. INTRODUCTION
Energy extraction from deep subsurface reservoirs has become a common practice during the last century. The accumulated subsurface energy has been stored in various forms, such as oil/gas and heat. In order to produce these resources economically, the reservoir should have sufficient hydraulic conductivity and connectivity toward the production well. However, the in-situ hydraulic conductivity of the rocks typically decreases with depth (e.g., Rutqvist and Stephansson, 2003) which reduces the productivity of the reservoir. Numerous stimulation techniques have been used to increase the hydraulic conductivity of the low-permeable reservoirs such as rock solution using acid (Muecke, 1982; Economides et al., 2000) and rock fracturing using hydraulic/thermal stimulation (Economides et al., 2000; Evans et al., 2005). Acid stimulation is usually used in the oil and gas industry to enhance the injectivity and productivity of the wellbore in the near field (i.e. meter scale). However, in order to increase the hydraulic conductivity of the reservoir at remote locations, hydraulic stimulation (i.e., the injection of fluids under high pressure) has become the most common practice, especially in the geothermal industry. Although not considered in this study, it should be mention that the hydraulic stimulation will have a thermal component as soon as non-isothermal fluid with respect to the in-situ temperature is injected into the reservoir.|","Document Type

J., Montana Tech of the University of Montana| Sordo, B., Montana Tech of the University of Montana| Berry, S. M., Montana Tech of the University of Montana| MacLaughlin, M. M., Montana Tech of the University of Montana| Berry, K. G., Freeport-McMoRan","|ABSTRACT: Current standard multi-stage direct shear test methods for rock joints do not consider the individually unique asperity profile and nature of the testing specimens. These techniques require either the shearing of a single sample under multiple normal loads, or the shearing of individual “similar” specimens also under multiple normal loads. “Similar” specimens of natural rock joints with identical asperity profiles are extremely difficult or impossible to locate, and continuous shearing of the same specimen causes damage to the asperity profile which will impact successive test data. Seeking to minimize this testing-inherent error, previous research at Montana Tech has demonstrated the alternate method of limited displacement multi-stage direct shear (LDMDS) testing to yield more accurate strength parameters when shearing a single unique specimen under multiple normal stresses. The LDMDS test procedure minimizes initial shear displacement and corresponding specimen surface damage, allowing the specimen to more closely retain its original asperity and strength profile as observed via undamaged single-stage testing. Replicas of a granitic rock joint (Specimen M3) were cast with Type III cement and sheared at normal stresses of 90, 180, and 270 kPa via Standard multi-stage, LDMDS, and undamaged single-stage methods. Average friction angle (<U+03C6>) and joint shear intercept (Sj) values yielded by LDMDS tests (<U+03C6> = 45°, Sj = 49 kPa) were significantly more similar to values calculated by undamaged single-stage tests (<U+03C6> = 51°, Sj = 22 kPa), as compared to the Standard multistage parameters which, as expected, produced a significantly underestimated friction angle (<U+03C6> = 22°) and overestimated joint shear intercept (Sj = 100 kPa).
1. INTRODUCTION
Obtaining accurate shear strength parameters for rock mass discontinuities through the use of direct shear tests is of critical importance to the design of safe slopes and underground openings. Evaluation of the standard Mohr-Coulomb strength parameters (joint friction angle and joint shear strength intercept) requires determination of the shear strength at a minimum of three different normal stress values.|","Document Type

In this study we conducted initial tests on the impact of the natural fractures and bedding angle on failure and the generation of acoustic emissions (AE) of Opalinus shale during unconfined compression. Cylindrical shale specimens were prepared with their long axis at varying angles to natural fractures and bedding. First, we measured the velocity, amplitude, and energy of 100 KHz acoustic waves transmitted along the sample axis. Each of these increased strongly as the angle incident to bedding decreased from 0 to 90 degrees. These observations will help to provide useful corrections for source location, focal mechanism studies, and for calculating the radiated seismic energy. The strength of the Opalinus showed a classic “U shape” strength anisotropy as the loading direction varied. During loading, we used wideband sensors to measure acoustic emissions, which became measurable at about 80% of the peak stress. The cumulative energy of acoustic emissions during failure were greatest when <U+03C3>1 was normal to bedding; about 60% less when <U+03C3>1 || bedding; and least for intermediate angles. Based on visual observations of the cracking patterns, tensile cracks were most numerous when the greatest compressive stress was parallel to bedding, fractures in shear orientations dominated when bedding was oriented at 300, 450, 600. When the greatest compressive stress was normal to bedding, the damage had a combination of shear and tensile orientations.
1. INTRODUCTION
In addition to being as the source of unconventional oil and gas resources, due to its low permeability, shale has been considered as a host rock for CO2 sequestration, wastewater injection and nuclear waste disposal, e.g. Opalinus formation from Mont Terri, Switzerland. However, most shales have bedding planes and natural fractures that strongly influence their physical properties, and this anisotropy must be included in planning for many engineering applications.|","Document Type

Q., China University of Petroleum| Lin, Q., China University of Petroleum| Bu, X. Q., Oil and Gas Technology Institute| Da, Y. P., Oil and Gas Technology Institute| Qi, Y., Oil and Gas Technology Institute","|ABSTRACT: Understanding of subcritical fracture process in rocks remains a challenging and crucial task. Traditionally the fracture process analysis is based on equivalent fracture approach, without any information of local responses surrounding the crack tip. In this paper, a semi-circular bend (SCB) specimen was tested under cyclic loading to create subcritical fractures, and acoustic emission was employed to characterize the fracture process. AE energy analyses reveal that AE energy is concentrated in a small zone, where 70%-90% of AE energy is focused, and it can be regarded as fracture process zone (FPZ). Indeed, AE locations occupy a much larger one for different cycles. Experimental results show FPZ growth rate dL/dA is related to equivalent stress intensity factor keff as C(<U+0394>keff)m, where C and m are the constants. It implies that the rate of FPZ advance per cycle obeys the Paris law, and m is determined as 8.6. Interestingly, the relation between AE energy increasing rate dE/dN and <U+0394>keff is found almost the same as dL/dN and <U+0394>keff. Therefore, FPZ growth rate can be associated with AE energy increasing rate by L2(dL/dN)=b*+a* ln(dE/dN). A theoretical model, containing fracture energy and FPZ growth rate, is proposed as (equation) to interpret the experimental results.
1. INTRODUCTION
Cyclic stress is one of the most common mechanisms associated with subcritical crack growth in rock (Atkinson, 1995). For example, the rocks have been subjected to cyclic stresses over a long period of time in the bridge structures (El-Ragaby et al., 2007; Zhang and Cai, 2007) and the oil and gas reservoirs (Zang et al., 2013; Fan and Zhang., 2014; Xing et al., 2016), such that fatigue can be regarded as the principal mechanism for structure failure.
Burdine (1963) first showed that compressive cycling of rock eventually results in failure with a systematic weakening process. Afterwards Hardy and Chugh (1970) and Haimson and Kim (1972) clearly demonstrated the time-dependent progressive weakening of rock due to cyclic loading. Scholz and Koczynski (1979) performed a series of tests to research the relationship between the numbers of cycles to failure and the amplitude of the stress cycle (Sa), in which crack growth due to fatigue is an increasing function of Sa. Kim and Mubeen (1981) verified the Westerly granite follows the law da/dN=C(<U+0394>K)m during fatigue, which was proposed by Paris et al. (1961) to describe metals. Thus, determining the crack length is important for subcritical fracture process. Shah (1990) proposed a widely used method to determine crack length calculated from global responses of three-point bending specimen, and Kolluru et al. (2000) revealed that crack growth owing to constant-amplitude fatigue loading comprised two stages: a deceleration stage obeyed the R-curve concept and a following acceleration stage followed Paris law. Recently, several models of improved Paris law type (Shah and Kishen ,2012; Le et al., 2014) were proposed to describe the fatigue behaviors of rock materials via acoustic emission (AE) and digital image correlation (DIC) methods, but the model for characterizing subcritical fracture growth based on the direct measurement results was not available.|","Document Type

In this paper, discrete element software PFC2d is used to establish the particle flow model of sandstone-mudstone interbedding reservoirs taking into account the influences of in-situ stress difference, rock interface properties and construction parameters on the initiation and propagation mechanism of hydraulic fractures. The result shows that in-situ stress is the key factor that controlling the fracture propagation path. When in-situ stress is lower than 5 MPa, hydraulic fractures can easily cross the interface. The strength of rock interface has a huge impact on the fracture propagation path, and shear slide would happen in the interfaces when they are penetrated by hydraulic fractures. By increasing the value of Q <U+03BC> (the product of viscosity and injection rate), the probability of fracture penetrating the interface is also increased. When using PFC2d to simulate the initiation and propagation process, there is no need to preset fracture propagation paths and divide meshes. The simulation results is accuracy and conform to the experimental results.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing stimulation in Tarim oil filed in west china has many problems, such as deep burial, thin oil layer, sandstone-mudstone interbedding, large sand distribution in both horizontal and vertical direction and cannot satisfy the requirements for slicing mining. To communicate the multiple sandstone layers through integrated fracturing, it is needed to clarify the propagation rule and influencing factors of hydraulic fracture in layered mediums.
Recently, many scholars had studied hydraulic fracture vertical propagating in layered medium through laboratory test and numerical simulation. In the aspect of laboratory test, Anderson [1] studied how the friction property between lithological interfaces affects the propagating of hydraulic fracture, and they found that the lower friction factor is, the higher normal stress is needed to make hydraulic fracture penetrate lithological interfaces. Warpinski [2] concluded that instead of lithology difference, the minimum horizontal stress difference has decisive effection on hydraulic fracture propagation; Cases [3] studied interfacial bonding material in fractures, fracture tip fluid lag and fracture propagation shape in geologic discontinuous reservoirs. Athavale [4] researched how lithology difference and stress difference in layered medium affects fracture propagating geometry. The research shows hydraulic fractures geometry in layer is complex, such as bifurcation, diversion and shearing slip between interfaces. Russel [5] analyzed fracture propagation model in layered medium through laboratory observation and acoustic emission monitoring, the results indicates symmetrical Penny-shaped fracture geometry was formed, and there is no slip between interfaces. Li [6] researched how natural fractures and in-situ stress difference affact the hydraulic fracture propagation path with specimens composed of sand stone, limestone and coal. In the aspect of numerical simulation, most simulation based on finite element software ABAQUS, Mahdi [7-8] simulated initiation and propagation of 3D hydraulic facture with Soil module in ABAQUS. Guo [9] researched the interference mechanism between hydraulic and natural fractures and hydraulic fracture propagation behavior under different horizontal stress difference, approaching angle and cementing strength of natural fractures. Because of the difference between artificial specimens without cement or cemented artificially and real layered rocks, these tests could not simulate the interfaces effection on fracture propagation. Besides, the model based on finite element need to set propagation path previously which creates apparent difference with real propagation process.|","Document Type

G., Montana Tech of the University of Montana| MacLaughlin, M. M., Montana Tech of the University of Montana","|ABSTRACT: Recent research at Montana Tech has focused on demonstrating the effectiveness of the emerging fiber-optic-based distributed strain and temperature (DST) and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technologies in an underground environment, facilitating their adoption by the mining industry and thereby contributing to mine safety. Deployment of a fiber optic array underground was used as base to compare the performance of this new technology to that of traditional instruments deployed at the site, and to compare performance of different brands of fiber optic cable. From the lessons and techniques learned during this deployment, an underground fiber optic array protocol has been developed to aid future engineers in the utilization of this tool.
1. BACKGROUND
Traditional sensors used in the underground mining industry are capable of collecting strain, temperature, or acoustic data from a single point or close proximity to the instrumentation. This single point sensing limits the engineer knowledge to the direct vicinity of their instrumentation, and requires an engineer to have a multi-sensory array in order to measure at multiple points. A distributed sensor on the other hand is capable of collecting data along the entirety of its length, thereby increasing the spatial resolution and amount of data that is collected. Specialized fiber optic sensors utilize distributed sensor technology to collect temperature, ground deformation, and acoustic data depending on the desired information. This project comprises the deployment of fibers capable of sensing all three targeted signal modifiers: temperature (distributed temperature sensing, or DTS), ground deformation (distributed strain and temperature sensing, or DST), and vibrations (distributed acoustic sensing, or DAS).
Although these technologies have been used successfully in other industries, they have yet to be adopted in the mining industry due to risk associated with investing in expensive equipment that may not provide satisfactory results. The main purpose of this project is to deploy DST fiber optic system at the Underground Mining Education Center (UMEC) located on the Montana Tech campus in Butte Montana, and show that it can survive in the underground environment and provide good data, thereby demonstrating its potential to contribute to mine safety.|","Document Type

C., New England Research| Gutierrez, M., Colorado School of Mines| Matzar, L., Halliburton","|ABSTRACT: Nanodarcy permeability is common in many oil- and gas-bearing unconventional formations requiring stimulation technologies, such as hydraulic fracturing, which can connect the isolated hydrocarbon-rich pores to a wellbore through induced fracture networks. Even though a dense induced fracture network is capable of accessing economic amounts of hydrocarbons, much of the rock between and very close to the fracture network is still un-accessed. Inducing fracture networks into rock can create large amounts of micro failures in surrounding regions that are not connected to the wellbore. Regions of rock containing microcracks near coalesced macro-scale fractures oftentimes behave differently than the original matrix material due to the permanent structural changes. These changes can manifest themselves in mechanical and petrophysical alterations from the original matrix conditions. Understanding that the coalesced fractures must drain the reservoir rock through these regions containing microcracks requires the characterization of damage within rock in terms of mechanical and petrophysical changes. In this study, a laboratory hydraulic fracture test was performed on a two-block system separated by a discontinuity as an analogue to a large natural fault. The induced hydraulic fracture was monitored with acoustic emissions (AE) throughout initiation, propagation, and interaction with the large fault. Individual AE event source characterization was performed to obtain mode of failure and relative volumetric deformation. Source characteristics were used in conjunction with cloud-based event density techniques to determine regions of differing damage within the cloud of microcracks. Quantitative three-dimensional event density imaging results were compared with permeability measurements on sub-cores taken from the sample post-test. Inverse relationship between AE event densities and permeability of sub-cores was observed, meaning that reductions in permeability were found nearest coalesced hydraulic fractures in the crystalline rock tested.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hydraulic fracturing has become a standard practice in oil- and gas-bearing formations with low permeability reservoirs especially in unconventional hydrocarbon resource development. Fracture complexity and/or fracture network generation is desired to create a dense hydraulically conductive pathway reaching as many isolated hydrocarbon-rich pores as possible. Although economic amounts of hydrocarbons can be reached, much of the rock very near the fractures, and sometimes within the network, is not accessed because of the very low permeability of the reservoir rock. It has become desirable to understand the changes induced within the surrounding rock not directly or hydraulically connected by a conductive pathway or fracture. This rock is typically associated with the longer-term fluid transport commonly seen in the slow tail of well production curves.|","laboratory,  damage,  microcrack,  hydraulic fracture, acoustic emission"

This paper discusses the derivation of reservoir and geomechanical properties from well logs in the unconventional reservoir of Middle Bakken in Williston Basin, ND. The study was performed on the middle member of the Bakken Formation in the Blue Buttes Field. Reservoir analysis consisted of determining the lithology and petrophysical properties such as porosity, permeability, water saturation, and shale volume calculations. We included XRD analysis for more precise analysis of the reservoir behavior. Geomechanical properties were calculated using existing correlations and relation. Those properties included the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, tensile strength, UCS, and pore pressure.
1. INTRODUCTION
The advancements in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling enabled production from the low porosity, low permeability Middle Bakken reservoir. The focus of this study is to add to the pool of information on the Bakken that will help with understanding of the properties and create a methodology for future similar studies. This case study will help with getting an additional information on the Bakken Formation and geomechanical properties in the Blue Buttes Field in particular as a major producing field. Middle Bakken is the producing part of the formation; therefore, it has been the attention of many geologists and reservoir engineers in order to characterize it in great details. Knowing these properties is important as they are used in the beginning of the oilfield development for reservoir simulation and geomodelling purposes as well as the geomechanical and Mechanical Earth Modelling (MEM).
Well log based modeling is the efficient way of getting different reservoir properties in the absence of actual core measurements, and it is considered more cost effective to get the data compared with conventional core measurements. The work started with well logs gathering from the designated field. The reservoir properties to identify were: porosity, permeability, effective permeability, water saturation, shale volume, lithology, and mineralogy. Various methods and approaches were used to acquire those properties.|","Document Type

Soda-lime glass cubes (10 cm<U+00D7>10 cm<U+00D7>10 cm) containing pre-existing, partially open fracture networks are subjected to true-triaxal stress state while viscous fluid is injected through a small (~3 mm diameter) analogue borehole to induce fractures in the sample. The preexisting fractures consist of either laser-etched microcracks or thermal-shock-induced fractures which are partially healed by re-heating of the glass. Initiation and propagation of the hydraulic fractures are monitored and recorded visually via webcams and acoustically using acoustic emissions. A series of experiments conducted with different fluid injection rates of the fracturing fluid show that the injection rate can have a significant impact on the interactions between hydraulic fractures and pre-existing fractures—fast injection results in less interactions—, affecting the overall geometry of the resulting hydraulic fracture network. Experiments involving time-varying (frequency-modulated) injection rate are also conducted, yielding different complexity and characteristics of the hydraulic fracture network.
1. INTRODUCTION
Propagation of fluid-injection-induced fractures within rock can be affected by weak interfaces, such as bedding and foliation planes, and open and healed fractures. How they interact with each other results in different fracture network geometry (e.g., Fisher et al, 2002), determining the success of oil and gas and geothermal reservoir stimulation.
Over the past decades, only a limited number of field observations (e.g., Warpinski & Trufel, 1987) have been made to understand the geometry of injection-induced fractures in real rock. In recent years, laboratory experiments involving large, meter-size rock samples have been conducted (e.g., Suarez-Rivera et al., 2013) to understand the fracturing behavior of heterogeneous shales. Usually, fracture growth is monitored via microearthquakes (in the field) and acoustic emissions (in the laboratory). However, the location of the fracturing events do not necessarily agree with the propagation of hydrologically connected (i.e., stimulating) fractures from the wells. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationships between the evolution of the fracture network and accompanying seismic signals is needed, through concurrent optical and seismic visualization.|","Document Type

F., University of Minnesota","|ABSTRACT: Failure data from compression and extension testing of Dunnville sandstone and Webatuck dolomite were analyzed using three different criteria: Mohr-Coulomb, Hoek-Brown, and Paul-Mohr-Coulomb. An emphasis was placed on the details of the failure criteria under tensile-compressive loading conditions, which was possible due to a dog-bone specimen geometry. Tension cut-offs were implemented when using Mohr-Coulomb and Paul-Mohr-Coulomb due to unrealistic predictions of (theoretical) tensile strength. It was determined that under tensile-compressive loading conditions, a tension cut-off provided a better match than Hoek-Brown to the data for the two rock types examined. Hoek-Brown overestimates the uniaxial tensile strength by a factor between 2-3 and has the greatest overall least absolute residual error in the low mean stress region.
1. INTRODUCTION
For isotropic rock, many failure criteria have been studied using a Mohr diagram, from the linear Mohr-Coulomb [1] to the nonlinear Hoek-Brown [2, 3]. In terms of principal stresses, it is convenient to express failure criteria of isotropic rock in terms of principal stresses with respect to magnitude (<U+03C3><U+0399> > <U+03C3>II > <U+03C3>III) or direction (<U+03C3>1, <U+03C3>2, <U+03C3>3), and the disregard of magnitude allows the representation of pyramidal failure surfaces. Most criteria do not perform well over a large range of stress states, from uniaxial tension with mode I fracture to large hydrostatic stresses with possible yielding. Several researchers have performed statistical analyses and other types of descriptive fitting methods to failure criteria of rock [4-7], but almost all the data in these studies have been generated under all three principal stresses being compressive.
Perhaps the most common test in rock mechanics is uniaxial compression, where the mean stress p at failure is p = C0/3 and Co = uniaxial compressive strength (UCS). Test conditions are rare for p < C0/3. A few exceptions are the experiments by Brace [8], who used a dog-bone geometry from Voigt and Bridgman [8], and applied it to crystalline rock. Due to the difference in cross-sectional area, a tensile stress can be generated in the axial direction due to the force from fluid (confining) pressure acting in the axial direction. Failure can be developed with <U+03C3>I > 0 and <U+03C3>III < 0 (the minor principal stress is tensile). Chester and Ramsey [9] used a particular type of dog-bone specimen, where the crosssectional area varied along the axis of the specimen. From experiments on Carrara Marble, they observed a transition from extension to shear fracture as mean stress varied. You [10] generated tensile-compressive stress states by performing direct tension tests under confinement, a special type of triaxial extension tests (<U+03C3>III < <U+03C3>II = <U+03C3>I).|","Document Type

Drilling engineers are challenged to select the optimum value for key drilling parameters such as ECD, Yp, MW, WOB, ROP and RPM to mitigate mud losses in this zone. Many of these drilling parameters are inter-related and the overall impact of changing key parameters requires extensive drilling experience or study. A multi-regression analysis was performed on mud loss event data for more than 75 wells drilled in the Dammam formation. From this analysis, a model was developed to predict total mud losses. Mud loss was found to be significantly affected by MW, ECD and ROP. Models for these key parameters were also developed from multi-regression analysis. The models were confirmed with additional well data from new wells drilled in the field. The models developed in this work provides a method for setting predicted mud losses, then limiting the operational drilling parameters to mitigate such losses in the future wells in fields with similar lithology.
1. INTRODUCTION
Drilling mud accounts for a major expense in drilling oil and gas wells. The drilling mud is circulated through the drill string and drill bit, to remove cuttings from the borehole and to enable drill bit performance. Drilling mud is specifically formulated to develop a thin coating on the borehole wall, referred to as a ‘mud cake’ which limits fluid losses to the formations already drilled and exposed in the borehole, as drill bit proceeds deeper and deeper. The concept of lost circulation or lost returns can be defined as “the partial or total loss of circulating fluid from the wellbore to the formation. It is the loss of whole fluid, not simply filtrate, to the formation. Losses can result from either natural or induced causes and can range from a couple of barrels per hour to hundreds of barrels in minutes. Lost circulation is one of the drilling’s biggest expenses in terms of rig time and safety. Uncontrolled lost circulation can result in a dangerous pressure control situation and loss of the well” (Baker Hughes, 1999).|","Document Type

A., Missouri University of Science and Technology| Nygaard, R., Oklahoma State University| Hilgedick, S. A., Missouri University of Science and Technology","|ABSTRACT: Probability theory has been increasingly applied to address the uncertainty of geomechanical parameters for prediction of allowable drilling mud weight. When conducting wellbore stability analysis, input parameters are estimated from well log data and empirical correlations. In depleted reservoirs, and deviated infill drilling, the uncertainty of these parameters is magnified with stress contrasts. A field case in SE Iraq, which highlights this issue, was studied post drilling operations, to assess the impact of this uncertainty in wellbore stability analysis. Sensitivity analysis showed that the maximum horizontal stress magnitude had the greatest effect on estimated conditions at failure, followed in decreasing order by internal friction angle, rock cohesion, vertical stress, minimum horizontal stress and pore pressure. Applying P90 as a threshold on the estimated minimum mud weight proved to be conservative. Field data showed wells drilled without observed instability issues with mud weights even below the P50 value. For fracture mud weight, on the other hand, the field data showed the P50 threshold for maximum mud weight did not prevent fluid losses. This illustrates the issue of applying threshold of P50 for selection the mud weight window to ensure wellbore stability analysis.
1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the traditional deterministic wellbore stability analysis (e.g., Aadnoy and Chenevert, 1987; Anderson et al., 1973; Bradley, 1979) has been expanded to include the probabilistic techniques for identifying the likelihood of instabilities (e.g., Aadnoy, 2011; Al-Ajmi and Al-Harthy, 2010; Gholami et al., 2015; Mclellan and Hawkes, 1996; Moos et al., 2003; Morita, 1995; Sheng et al., 2006; Udegbunam et al., 2014). The rationale of this shift is the uncertainty of many influential parameters, namely the in-situ state of stresses, rock strength and pore pressure. Well log measurements are a great contributor to this uncertainty through instrument and interpretation error (Gholami et al., 2015). The heterogeneous nature of the geological strata is another source which may be produced errors in predicting formation tops prior to drilling. Carbonate reservoirs by nature have complex depositional environments and diagenetic processes (Chilingarian et al., 1992). This results in a complex pore structure in which ductile, brittle, fractured rocks and vugular pores may all exist within small interval. This huge variance in rock mechanical properties can cause drilling problems, such as differential pipe sticking, tight hole and lost circulation. The common lack of core samples and rock mechanical tests to calibrate well log based strength increases the importance of including uncertainty when applying empirical correlations to estimate the mechanical rock properties along the borehole. Also, insufficient calibration data and erroneous interpretation of in-situ stresses is an issue when conducting wellbore stability analysis (Aadnoy, 2011). Another source of error results from the assumptions of constitutive models combined with failure criteria to describe rock deformation and failure as resulting from applied stresses. However, these uncertainties are often omitted when applying deterministic models to assess the output (i.e., mud weight) as a single value which is not fairly reasonable for post drilling planning.|","Document Type

With the progress of understanding the nature of shale reservoirs, we find that some shale methane is stored as an adsorbed phase on surfaces of organic carbon. Meanwhile, laboratory and theoretical calculations indicate that organic-rich shale adsorbs CO2 preferentially over CH4. Shale gas reservoirs are recently becoming the promising underground target for CO2 sequestration. In the paper, systematic numerical simulations will be implemented to investigate the feasibility of CO2 sequestration in shale gas reservoirs and quantify the associated uncertainties. |First, a multi-continua porous medium model will be set up to present the matrix, nature fractures and hydraulic fractures in shale gas reservoirs. Based on this model, we will investigate a three-stage flow mechanism which includes convective gas flow mainly in fractures, dispersive gas transport in macro pores and multi-component sorption phenomenon in micro pores. To deal with this complicated three-stage flow mechanism simultaneously, analytical apparent permeability which includes slip flow and Knudsen diffusion will be incorporated into a commercial simulator CMG-GEM. A Langmuir isotherm model is used for CH4 and the multilayer sorption gas model, a BET model, is implemented for CO2. In addition, a mixing rule is introduced to deal with the CH4-CO2 competitive adsorption phenomenon. |In the paper, an integrated methodology is provided to investigate the CO2 sequestration process. Simulation results indicate that a shale gas reservoir is an ideal target for the CO2 sequestration. Even with the reservoir pressure maintenance due to the injection of CO2, the reservoir productivity is not enhanced. Hydraulic fracking which creates freeways for gas flow is the key to improve the reservoir performance. The multicomponent desorption/adsorption is a very important feature in a shale gas reservoir, which should be fully harnessed to benefit the CO2 sequestration process.

However, the complexity of the tectonic, depositional and diagenetic processes, together with the commonly limited amount of measurements and related available information make the construction of 1D mechanical models a major challenge. Current published models for unconventionals are highly variable, even for the same play. Initial assumptions, such as material isotropy or pore pressure estimation method used, have an important impact on model results. |In this contribution, we are presenting a complete workflow to define and estimate pore pressure, isotropic and anisotropic elastic moduli, poroelastic effects and finally far field stresses from commonly available well logs. TIV anisotropy in the shale intervals, velocity relationship with effective stress, poroelastic effects and tectonic strains are all considered in the building of the model. Tectonic strain and the minimum to maximum tectonic strain ratio were the parameters used for model calibration. Failure analysis and ISIPs, together with triaxial test results were the main sources of calibration for the model. |This case study covers 40 vertical wells with electric, sonic and nuclear logs in a region of the Neuquen basin known as Neuquen Embayment.

These unconventional plays have a huge oil potential; however, the predicted primary oil recovery is still low as an average of 7.5 %. Injecting carbon dioxide (CO2) to enhance oil recovery in these poor-quality formations is still a debatable issue among investigators. In this study, three steps of research have been integrated to investigate the parameters which control the success of CO2 huff-n-puff process in the field scale of shale oil reservoirs. Firstly, a numerical simulation study was conducted to upscale the reported experimental studies outcomes to the field conditions. The second step was to validate these numerical models with the field data from some of CO2-EOR pilots which were performed in Bakken formation, in North Dakota and Montana regions. Finally, statistical methods for Design of Experiments (DOE) have been used to rank the most important parameters affecting CO2-EOR performance in these unconventional reservoirs. |The Design of Experiments approved that the intensity of natural fractures (the number of natural fractures per length unit in each direction, I-direction, J direction, and K direction) and the conductivity of oil pathways (the average conductivity for the entire oil molecules path, from its storage (matrix) to the wellbore) are the two main factors controlling CO2-EOR success in shale oil reservoirs. However, the fracture intensity has a positive effect on CO2-EOR while the later has a negative effect. Furthermore, this study found that the porosity and the permeability of natural fractures in shale reservoirs are clearly changeable with the production time, which in turn, led to a clear gap between CO2 performances in the lab conditions versus to what happened in the field pilots. This work reported that the molecular diffusion mechanism is the key mechanism for CO2 to enhance oil recovery in shale oil reservoirs. However, the conditions of the candidate field and the production well criteria can enhance or downgrade this mechanism in the field scale. Accordingly, the operating parameters for managing CO2-EOR huff-n-puff process should be tuned according to the candidate reservoir and well conditions.

In this paper, two engineering-reversed approaches have been integrated to investigate the feasibility of CO2 huff-n-puff process in shale oil reservoirs. Firstly, a numerical simulation study was conducted to upscale the reported experimental-studies outcomes to the field conditions. As a result, different forward diagnostic plots have been generated from different combinations of CO2 physical mechanisms with different shale-reservoirs conditions. Secondly, different backward diagnostic plots have been produced from the history match with CO2 performances in fields’ pilots which were performed in Bakken formation of North Dakota and Montana. Finally, fitting the backward with the forward diagnostic plots was used to report and diagnose some findings regarding the injected-CO2 performance in field scale. |This study found that the porosity and permeability of natural fractures in shale reservoirs are significantly changed with production time, which in turn, led to a clear gap between CO2 performances in lab-conditions versus to what happened in field pilots.

Most of the information was collected at PUC-Rio and Petrobras, in Brazil. The research is focused on data acquisition, mud contamination, cementation, and the phenomenon known as affluence of salt. When taking seismic data from areas with high noise potential due to the presence of salt rock, it is recommended to use a WAZ technique in the first instance to avoid cost overruns. Concluding, a good characterization of the type of salt is very important, verify the composition and determine how clean or dirty saline rock is, because its behavior facing changes of temperature and pressure varies according to its chemical composition. This will allow the best measures to be taken in order to avoid potential problems such as inflow or increase in the rheological properties of the mud. |1 INTRODUCTION |Due to the problems presented when drilling saline deposits and the belief of the absence of hydrocarbons under those structures, these formations were for a long time avoided and little studied. However, the decline in reserves and discoveries that were made in West Africa, North Sea, Mexico and Brazil, made this type of structures attractive. This is the case of Brazil, which after the great discovery of the pre-salt has developed new methods of data acquisition, new theories of formation and migration of salt, as well as innovation in techniques and equipment in order to reduce the uncertainty, risks and costs.

This selection is made more difficult at the beginning of the exploratory phase, especially in very thick formations (greater than 500 ft), where there may be several prospective intervals from the point of view of rock quality. Initial tests in vertical wells have a higher investment risk associated with the completion of unfavorable horizons for fracturing, i.e. failures during execution the hydraulic fracturing or great difficulty for proppant admission, therefore an inefficient fracture is created for migration of reservoir fluids into the well. As a result of interdisciplinary work, a methodology for selecting horizons with greater probability of success in hydraulic fracturing (under the Colombian tectonic environment) and for incorporating resources in a vertical well in an unconventional reservoir that has several prospective horizons was generated. Additionally, for the horizons with potential production of gas and gas condensate, a prioritization criterion was established, taking into account the effect of pore pressure decline on the matrix permeability (stress sensitivity). |The proposed methodology is based on: a) generate and interpret an anisotropic geomechanical model, b) selecting intervals that meet the quality criterion for completion in terms of elastic properties, c) generate a probabilistic solution for the distribution of the minimal horizontal stress, fracture gradient and net pressure, d) classifying selected intervals based on the likelihood of having a favorable complexity fracture, e) classifying the intervals in terms of mobility of fluids in the reservoir, f) sorting the prospective intervals in terms of value generation associated with each resource. By applying the methodology it is achieved for example discard prospective horizons with good rock quality, high probability of success of completion but low incorporation of resources, another possibility is to discard horizons with good rock quality, good fluid quality but low probability of successful completion.

Therefore, a basic geomechanical work program consists of defining the original in-situ stress condition, characterizing the rock structure and deformation/strength properties and finally, simulating the dynamical stress conditions after an engineering disturbance is introduced to rock formations which has otherwise reached equilibrium in the geological history. |In many situations, heavy oil production takes place in relatively shallow, weakly- or un-consolidated and/or geologically young rock formations. In-situ stress measurements in the field and laboratory tests on the core samples in these unique situations require special attention to principles and details. Moreover, heavy oil production often requires stimulation by injecting stimulating materials which may be at high pressures and/or high temperatures. Nonlinear coupling between the thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) mechanisms become significant and must be adequately accounted for. All these unique challenges demand special QC/QA measures in carrying out the geomechanical works. This is the focus of the present paper. These measures are derived from experience in over 1,000 projects/tests and also after a peer review of relevant published works in the industry. Details to be covered include: use of multiple interpretation methods, real-time analysis and openhole in a mini-frac test; use of whole cores, drained condition, slow strain rates and/or heating rates in laboratory tests.

The main reason of these events are associated to crossing structural lineaments during drilling such as faults and set of natural fractures together with the already depleted reservoir sandstone, which results in a drop of the magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress also known as closure pressure of such natural fractures. As a result of the decreased magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress, the natural fractures are considered to be in a critical state of stress increasing the risk of having mud losses through the opened natural fractures. Ecopetrol’s geomechanics team has led the visualization and conceptualization of such mud losses events from ant-tracking models got from seismic data and plotted on the prospects wells surveys. A total of 18 wells scattered in the field were analyzed using the proposed methodology in this paper showing 78% of effectiveness of the prediction mud losses during drilling. |1 INTRODUCTION |Based on the analysis of the drilling history of 442 wells drilled from 2005 to 2015 it was possible to point that 17.5% of the time was associated to non-productive time (NPT) and 18% of it was due to mud losses events.

Therefore, drilling geomechanics plays an important role in engineering planning and calculation prior to the construction of a wellbore which makes it possible to determine a possible instability of the rock formation associated to the drilling inclination of wellbore and inclination of preexisting bedding plane. This paper analyzes the effect of the attack of angle of drilling on the geomechanical wellbore stability of formations with weak bedding plane or laminations using a finite element model and the Abaqus® software considering the rock as an isotropic medium. Three analytic tests with different drilling angles were developed, allowing to establish relationship between the attack angle and wellbore stability. Variables such stress, deformation and failure in rock bedding plane during drilling were analyzed. The results show that at higher attack angles the greater the wellbore instability is associated with the presence of the weak bedding plane |1 INTRODUCTION |During the drilling of hydrocarbon wells various types of rock and lithologic formations are drilled, including among them naturally laminated ones or bedding planes formations. These formations contain natural disorders that are called weak bedding plane, which represent a major operational challenge during drilling due to the characteristics of its surfaces with little or no cohesion between them. This causes a displacement and imminent separation of the surfaces, namely, unstable conditions when being altered mechanically with the cutting bit, generating slides and cavings into the wellbore which subsequently cause operational problems during drilling such as stuck pipe or loss of circulation causing extra costs in wellbore drilling. It is of the utmost importance to analyze the intensity of the instability of the wellbore depending on the direction and angle with which the weak bedding plane are perforated.|","finite elements method, Attack angle,  wellbore stability,  drilling"

Several and catastrophic mud losses events are continuously experienced during drilling the 8<U+00BD><U+00A8>section in Castilla Field in Llanos basin, Colombia. Technologies like Manage Pressure Drilling (MPD), thixotropic fluids, LCM (Lost Control Materials), ECD (equivalent circulating density) management were applied to avoid/manage mud losses but the issues associated to mud losses continue being a major problem causing among others wellbore instability in K1 superior formation due to fluid static column variations. According to the events, wellbore instability becomes the new problem causing hole cleaning issues, tight hole and restrictions tripping drill pipe and 7<U+00A8> liner. In image logs were detected several natural fractures both open and partially open. Fracture<U+00B4>s hydraulic conductivity hypothesis was proposed. To better understand the problem an evaluation of critically stressed fracture analysis was conducted by estimation of normal and shear stresses in each fracture plane assuming pressure transmission from the wellbore to the fractures. Geomechanical parameters estimated for each interval in which fractures were identified, entered the analysis as an input. Then, the fracture<U+00B4>s stresses were compared to the rock<U+00B4>s failure envelope assuming no cohesion in the planes. As a result, was figure out a reactivation gradient, which is compared to the pressure losses estimated based on the static column height in wells that experienced mud losses. The main observation is that there exists a fracture reactivation pressure lower than the minimum horizontal stress gradient and close to reservoir<U+00B4>s pressure that if is overcome, mud losses take place. |1 INTRODUCTION |Fractures are discontinuities that create escape paths for drilling fluids and thereby constitute an important mechanism of lost circulation. Most rocks contain fractures of various sizes from micro cracks at grain level to fractures extending for hundreds of feet in the reservoir. In some reservoirs, fractures provide important pathways for the reservoir fluids. Connectivity of the fracture network is its essential property. In the lost circulation context, it affects how much drilling fluid can be lost. In natural fractured reservoirs, the availability of a connected fracture system is essential for production, but is detrimental for drilling (Lavrov A, 2016).|","Fractures,  Mud losses,  Stresses Tensor,  Castilla Field, Geomechanics,  Stresses variations"

If high recovery factors are sought, production of heavy-oil reservoirs requires stimulation to reduce oil viscosity. Intelligent use of geomechanics can create additional porosity and permeability by managing rock dilation and fracturing behavior. As a result, new areas are created for injected stimulants to contact the heavy oil, speeding up viscosity reduction and improving oil production. Additionally, the same mechanism can break down the permeability barriers in the reservoir for the injected stimulants to travel through, ultimately improving the reservoir recovery factor. |Using field examples, this paper illustrates theoretical mechanisms and field results. It will hopefully provide a new paradigm for operators when planning their heavy-oil production, because geomechanics is both a necessity and a means to value creation. |1 INTRODUCTION |Becoming an increasingly important component of global energy supply, development of heavy-oil resources has attracted world attention.

However, a number of drawbacks associated with simulation are often cited in dissuading their use as a major tool for caprock integrity assessment. This paper will explain that these drawbacks are not inherent in simulation itself. If vigorous efforts are exercised, there are means to overcome these drawbacks. Three approaches are presented: deterministic, probabilistic, and joint inversion. Theoretical principles as well as case histories are given to support observations: (1) forward deterministic simulations are still valid in yielding accurate results that compare well with field observations; (2) probabilistic simulation is a powerful tool to quantify the impact of uncertain material properties and their spatial variability; and (3) the data-intensive nature of a thermal project is an important asset that can be used by a joint mathematical inversion system to make inferences about evolving subsurface processes. |1 INTRODUCTION |Whether or not it contains resources of economic value, every interval of subsurface rock formation is invaluable and their integrity must be safeguarded. If containment integrity of the caprock above a petroleum reservoir is damaged, reservoir fluid can escape into undesirable locations. This is particularly essential for heavy-oil development because it requires reservoir stimulation through injection of steam, solvent, and other chemicals to reduce the oil viscosity. For example, cumulative energy injected into a reservoir and thus stored at the subsurface during a thermal project is too significant to ignore the caprock integrity issues. If not managed properly, this energy source can harm us socially, environmentally, and economically. |Several incidences of steam release, drilling blowout, reservoir fluid escaping into shallow depths including into groundwater aquifers, or reservoir fluid escaping to the ground surface have been reported publically (Smith et al. 2004; ERCB 2010; AER 2013). More common is the significant casing deformation during thermal operation. Moreover, concerns are raised about the significant uneven surface heave that may alter facilities, roads, landscape, and surface/subsurface hydrogeological conditions. |Caprock integrity eventually becomes a geomechanical issue, even though it is first a concern of hydraulic integrity (i.e., no reservoir fluid should escape through the caprock into more shallow areas). Naturally, such hydraulic integrity is already inherently placed in-situ in the geological history because the caprock has prevented any further upward movement of hydrocarbon migration.|","reservoir containment integrity,  geomechanical joint inversion, probabilistic simulation"

Considering that conventional wellbore stability models don’t include the effect of circulation losses through fractured zones, this research aims to design a new algorithm that models the phenomenon of circulation and filtered loss through fractured formations. Additionally, an integrated model which includes aspects like: fracture deformation, mud rheology, and flow through fractures is implemented. This new algorithm takes into account the most important considerations in this area published in the literature The algorithm proposed in this research enables to solve mathematical models analytically and numerically in order to analyze all the possible solutions integrated in the model which includes differential equations for the fluid flow and analytical equations for the formation properties, fracture behavior and mud rheology. This new algorithm allows to determine fracture widths in real time, using information of the circulation loss or the required mud weight, if the known fracture width to maintain losses at its minimum permitted movement. These results are important to select the lost circulation material (LCM), reservoir engineering, secondary permeability log and the operation simulation can be optimized.

Numerical experiments show that the key factors controlling the complexity of the induced-fracture networks include stress anisotropy, injection rate, natural-fracture distribution (fracture-dip angle, strike angle, spacing, density, and length), fracture-filling properties (the degree of cementation and permeability), fracture-surface properties (cohesion and friction angle), and tensile strength of intact rock. It is found that the smaller the stress anisotropy and/or the lower the injection rate, the more complex the fracture network; a high rock tensile strength could increase the possibility of the occurrence of shear fractures; and under conditions of large permeability of fracture filling combined with small cohesive strength and friction coefficient, shear slip could become the dominant mechanism for generating complex-fracture networks. The model developed and the results presented can be used to understand the propagation of complex-fracture networks and aid in the design and optimization of hydraulic-fracturing treatments.|","complex fracture networks, hydraulic fracturing, coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) model, MPFA L-method, crossing criterion"

Shale gas reservoirs have specific characteristics, such as tight reservoir rock with nanodarcy permeability. Multistage hydraulic fracturing is required for such low-permeability reservoirs to create very complex fracture networks and therefore to connect effectively a huge reservoir volume to the wellbore. During hydraulic fracturing, an enormous amount of water is injected into the formation, where only 25–60% is reproduced during flowback and a long production period. A major concern with hydraulic fracturing is the water-blocking effect in tight formations caused by the high capillary pressure and the presence of water-sensitive clays. High water saturation in the invaded zone near the fracture face may reduce gas relative permeability greatly and may impede gas production. |In this paper, we consider the numerical techniques to simulate during hydraulic fracturing the water invasion or formation damage and its impact on the gas production in shale gas reservoirs. Two-phase-flow simulations are considered in a large stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) containing extremely low-permeability tight matrix and multiscale fracture networks including primary hydraulic fractures, induced secondary fractures, and natural fractures. |To simulate the water-blocking phenomenon, it is usually required to explicitly discretize the fracture network and use very fine meshes around the fractures. On the one hand, the commonly used single-porosity model is not suitable for this kind of problem, because a large number of gridblocks is required to simulate the fracture network and fracture–matrix interaction. On the other hand, a dual-porosity (DP) model may also be not applicable, because of the long transient duration with large block sizes of ultralow-permeability matrix. In this paper, we study the applicability of the MINC (multiple interacting continuum) method, and use a hybrid approach between matrix and fractures to correctly simulate the fracturing-fluid invasion and its backflow during hydraulic fracturing. This approach allows us to quantify the fracturing water invasion and its formation-damage effect in the whole SRV.|","Shale Gas, Formation Damage, Hydraulic fracturing , MINC method , Two-phase flow simulation"

On the other hand, stress-dependent porosity and compressibility correlations with respect to permeability as a function of net confining stress (NCS) are also introduced. The work is important because of the presence of stress-dependent slot and/or microfracture porosities and permeabilities in tight formations that can significantly affect reservoir performance and forecasting. |Recent work has shown that drill cuttings can be used quantitatively for complete petrophysical evaluation and rock-mechanical-properties estimation (Olusola and Aguilera 2013; Ortega and Aguilera 2014). The methods have been shown to be useful in those instances in which cores and specialized well logs are scarce. Porosity and permeability values obtained from the aforementioned works are extended in this paper to quantitative evaluation of stress-dependent properties. |It is concluded that drill cuttings are important direct sources of information that can be used for developing estimates of stress-dependent petrophysical properties particularly in those cases in which cores and specialized logs are scarce or not available.

One major difference in shale-gas reservoirs is that a considerable amount of gas is adsorbed. Up to 85% of the total gas within shale may be found adsorbed on clay and kerogen. How much of the adsorbed gas can be produced has a significant effect on ultimate recovery. Even with improving fracturing and horizontal-well technologies, the average gas-recovery factors in US shale plays are only approximately 30% with primary depletion. Adsorbed gas can be desorbed by lowering pressure and raising temperature and reservoir-flow capacity can be also influenced by temperature, so there is a big prize to be claimed by use of thermal-stimulation techniques to enhance recovery. To date, not much work has been done on thermal stimulation of shale-gas reservoirs. |In this study, we present general formulations to simulate gas production in fractured shale-gas reservoirs for the first time, with fully coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) properties. The unified-shale-gas-reservoir model developed in this study enables us to investigate multiphysics phenomena in shale-gas formations. Thermal stimulation of fractured gas reservoirs by heating propped fractures is proposed and investigated. This study provides some fundamental insight into real-gas flow in nanopore space and gas-adsorption/desorption behavior in fractured gas shales under various in-situ conditions, and sets a foundation for future research efforts in the area of enhanced recovery of shale-gas reservoirs. |We find that thermal stimulation of shale-gas reservoirs has the potential to enhance recovery significantly by enhancing the overall flow capacity and releasing adsorbed gas that cannot be recovered by primary depletion.

Despite the successful use of lost-circulation materials (LCMs) in treating lost-circulation events of the drilling operations, extensions of wellbore-stability models to the case of a fractured and LCM-treated wellbore have not been published. This paper presents an extension of the conventional wellbore-stability analysis to such circumstances. The proposed wellbore geomechanics solution revisits the criteria for breakdown of a fractured wellbore to identify an extended margin for the equivalent circulation density (ECD) of drilling. An analytical approach is taken to solve for the related multiscale and nonlinear problem of the three-way mechanical interaction between the wellbore, fracture wings, and LCM aggregate. The criteria for unstable propagation of existing near-wellbore fractures, together with those for initiating secondary fractures from the wellbore, are obtained. Results suggest that, in many circumstances, the occurrence of both incidents can be prevented, if the LCM blend is properly engineered to recover certain depositional and mechanical properties at downhole conditions. Under such optimal design conditions, the maximum ECD to which the breakdown limit of a permeable formation could be enhanced is predicted.|","Mud Weight, Wellbore Stability,  LCM"

Although many factors may influence fracture-height evolution in multilayer formations, the consensus is that the so-called “equilibrium height belonging to a certain treating pressure” provides an upper limit. However, because of the complexity of the algebra involved, published height models are overly simplified and do not provide reliable results. |We revisited the equilibrium-height problem, started from the definition of the fracture stress-intensity factor (SIF), considered variation of layered formation properties and effects of hydrostatic pressure, and developed a multilayer fracture-equilibrium-height (MFEH) model by use of the programming software Mathematica (2017). The detailed derivation of SIF and work flow of MFEH model are provided. |The model is compared with existing models and software, under the same ideal geology condition. Generally, MShale (2013) calculated smaller height, and FracPro (2015) larger height, than the MFEH model. Most of the difference is attributable to the different interpretation of the “net pressure,” and the solving of the nonlinear equations of SIF as well. In the normally stressed case, they are both acceptable, although MShale is more reliable. The discrepancy is much larger when there is abnormally high or low stress in the adjacent layers of the perforated interval. The effects of formation rock and fluid properties on the fracture-height growth were investigated. Tip jump is caused by low in-situ stress, whereas tip stability is imposed by large fracture toughness and/or large in-situ stress. If the fluid density is ignored, the result regarding which tip will grow into infinity could be totally different. Second and even third and fourth solutions for a three-layer problem were found by Excel experiments and this model, and proved unrealistic; however, they can be avoided in our MFEH model. The full-height map with very-large top- and bottom-formation thicknesses shows the ultimate trend of height-growth map (i.e., when the fracture tip will grow to infinity) and suggests the maximum pressure to be used. To assess the potential effects of reservoir-parameter uncertainties on the height map, two three-layer pseudoproblems were constructed by use of a multilayer formation to create an outer- and inner-height envelope. |The improved MFEH model fully characterizes height evolution amid various formation and fluid properties (fracture toughness, in-situ stress, thickness, and fluid density), and for the first time, rigorously and rapidly solves the equilibrium height. The equilibrium height can be used to provide input data for the 2D model, improve the 3D-model governing equations, determine the net pressure needed to achieve a certain height growth, and suggest the maximum net pressure ensuring no fracture propagation into aquifers. This model may be incorporated into current hydraulic-fracture-propagation simulators to yield more-accurate and -cost-effective hydraulic-fracturing designs.|","Stress Intensity Factor, Height Map, Equilibrium-Height, Multilayer, Fracture Propagation"

The temperature profile along the wellbore during the drilling process has not been thoroughly investigated because the gas-hydrate cuttings could affect the temperature of the drilling fluid along the wellbore. As the mixture of drilling fluid and gas hydrates flows from the bottom to the surface, the methane and other hydrocarbons present in the gas hydrates would change from liquid to gas phase and further cause well-control issues. Furthermore, the bottomhole pressure would decrease and could not provide sufficient balance to the formation pressure, which could significantly increase the risk of well blowout. |A numerical solution is presented in this paper to predict the temperature profile of the gas-hydrate well during the drilling process. The main considerations were the following: |Hydrate cuttings entrained in the bottom of the hole would affect the temperature of the fluid in the annulus space. |The entrained hydrate cuttings could affect the fluid thermal properties in the drillstring and in the annulus. |Because of the Joule-Thomson cooling effect at the outlet of the nozzles, the fluid temperature at the bottom of the hole was lower than that above the drill-bit nozzles. |Hence, the gas-hydrate-dissociation characteristics were considered and integrated in the proposed numerical model. |The numerical model was validated by comparing the obtained data with the Shan et al. (2016) analytical model. In addition, the obtained data were also compared with the measured temperature data of a conventional well drilled in China and a gas-hydrate-well drilling record in India. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the effects of the pumping rate, Joule-Thomson effect, and injection drilling-mud temperature on the annulus temperature-profile distribution. It was found that the injection drilling-mud temperature and pumping rate could affect the temperature profile in the annulus, whereas the Joule-Thomson effect could decrease the annulus temperature of the drilling mud near the bottom.|","Annular Temperature, Gas Hydrates, Numerical Solution, Drilling"

Borrowing from ideas in chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR), surfactants have potential to reduce the effect of fracturing-fluid loss on hydrocarbon permeability in the matrix. Unconventional tight reservoirs can differ significantly from one another, which could make the use of these techniques effective in some cases but not in others. We present an experimental investigation dependent on a coreflood sequence that simulates fluid invasion, flowback, and hydrocarbon production from hydraulically fractured reservoirs. We compare the benefits of shut-ins and reduction in interfacial tension (IFT) by surfactants for hydrocarbon permeability for different initial reservoir conditions (IRCs).

It is shown that this modeling approach provides an alternative to finite-element and finite-volume methods for solving poroelastic and fracture-propagation problems. In this paper, we specifically investigate the interaction between an HF and natural fractures (NFs). The peridynamics model presented here allows us to simulate the propagation of multiple, nonplanar, interacting fractures and provides a novel approach to simulate the interaction between HFs and NFs. The model predictions in two dimensions have been validated by reproducing published experimental results where the interaction between an HF and an NF is controlled by the principal-stress contrast and the approach angle. A detailed parametric study involving poroelasticity and mechanical properties of the rock is performed to understand why an HF becomes arrested or crosses an NF. This analysis reveals that poroelasticity, resulting from high fracture-fluid leakoff, has a dominant influence on the interaction between an HF and an NF. In addition, the fracture toughness of the rock, the toughness of the NF, and the shear strength of the NF also affect the interaction between an HF and an NF. We also investigate the interaction of multiple completing fractures with NFs in two dimensions and demonstrate the applicability of the approach to simulate complex fracture networks on a field scale. Finally, the 3D interaction study elucidated that the height of the NF, the position of the NF, and the opening resistance of the NF all have a significant effect on the 3D interaction between an HF and an NF.|","Peridynamics, Natural Fracture, Poroelasticity, 3-D Interaction, Hydraulic Fracturing"

First, the current models are challenging to efficiently handle the complex nonplanar fractures with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length caused by very-complicated gridding issues, a high computational cost, and complexities in development of computational codes. Second, the conventional gas-diffusivity equation needs to be revised to include all important gas-transport mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption. Hence, the goal of this study was to develop a new model to fill this gap. |We present an efficient semianalytical model by dividing fractures into several fracture segments to represent the complex nonplanar-fracture geometry and present a revised diffusivity equation to consider all the important gas-transport mechanisms for shale-gas reservoirs. We verified this model against a numerical reservoir simulator and an analytical solution for a single planar fracture. Transient-flow behavior between planar fractures and nonplanar fractures with and without considering the natural fractures was compared. Furthermore, a well with actual production data from the Marcellus Shale was analyzed. First, we use a complex hydraulic-fracture-propagation model to generate nonplanarfracture geometry. Then, we apply the fracture geometry in the semianalytical model to evaluate well performance. Contributions of each mechanism to gas recovery are examined. By use of history matching and production forecasting, the difference of cumulative gas production between the nonplanar fractures and the converted planar fractures with equal fracture length is approximately 12% at 30 years of production. In addition, the contribution of gas diffusion, gas slippage, and gas desorption to gas recovery at 30 years of production compared with that without considering them is approximately 11, 16, and 25%, respectively.

Microcantilever beam geometries were milled and loaded to failure in tension while monitoring in situ with SEM. The force-displacement curves were generated while videos recording in-situ real-time displacements and failures were collected simultaneously. |The microcantilever beam tests of this composite natural material demonstrate linear elastic behavior followed by elastic/plastic yield before complete failure.

This same methodology was used to complete two northwest-trending horizontal wells drilled on the northeast flank of the Lost Hills anticlinal structure that targeted thinner, higher-oil-saturation strata separated by thicker lower-oil-saturation intervals. The target reservoir presents high-porosity, low-matrix-permeability, and low-Young’s-modulus Opal A diatomite. |The perforations were jetted by pumping sand slurry down the CT, and the fracture job was pumped down the annulus. The stages were isolated by setting sand plugs. Nine and twelve stages were pumped in the two wells, respectively. The perforation locations for different stages were selected in areas with high resistivity and inferred high oil saturations, an absence of hydraulic fractures from nearby wells, excellent cement bonding, and low intensity of natural fractures. These assessments followed logging-while-drilling (LWD) with gamma ray, induction-resistivity and azimuthally focused resistivity (AFR) (image) logs, and a cased-hole ultrasonic image tool (USIT) run with the aid of a tractor. The hydraulic fractures were monitored by use of surface tiltmeter sensors. Oil- and water-soluble tracers were pumped to determine the relative production contribution from the stages and fracture-fluid cleanup, respectively, from the stages. All the jobs could be pumped successfully without any screenouts. Challenges were faced in setting sand plugs and isolating stages. Large fracture widths and low leakoff into the formation led to difficulty in forming sand bridges at the perforations and concentrating sand in the wellbore for the plugs. Surface tiltmeters showed excessive fracture-height growth. Tracer results showed that 20 to 30% of the stages contributed to 50 to 60% of the production. Stages with higher treating pressures contributed less toward production. This could be attributed to near-wellbore tortuosity in these stages. Proppant flowback was encountered in one well, and after an effective cleanup, the production rose. |The study illustrates how integration of various aspects, such as completion design, fracture-pressure analysis, and diagnostics, combined with geologic and reservoir information can help in identifying challenges and finding potential solutions for hydraulic fracturing.

Critical geomechanics behind the multiwell-fracturing techniques include pore-pressure propagation, cooling stress, tip-induced shear stress, and reversal of stress anisotropy. To optimize multiwell-fracturing treatments, we numerically investigated fracture growth from the perspective of thermo/hydromechanical (THM) coupling. The coupled geomechanics and fluid-heat-flow model is derived from a mixed finite-element (FE) and finite-volume (FV) method, which is capable of simulating multifracture growth in heterogeneous reservoirs. In this study, both hydraulic-fracture (HF) propagation and natural-fracture (NF) reactivation in opening or shearing patterns were taken into account. Particularly, an elastoplastic fracture constitutive model was adopted to predict permanent enhancement of fracture aperture. The effects of perforation-cluster spacing, well spacing, and the fracturing sequence of multiwell completion upon fracture complexity were studied, where the total hydraulically fractured area was treated as the primary indicator of HF effectiveness. By numerical parametric studies, we determined four findings. First, there is an optimal cluster spacing for maximizing the total fracture area for a stage with a given length. Cluster spacing mainly affects stress distribution during HF, which subsequently affects the path of newly created fracture propagation and crossing behaviors (i.e., crossing, arresting, or offsetting). Second, suitable well spacing should be chosen carefully to avoid the hydraulic interconnection between the tip-to-tip stages, as well as to make use of tip-induced shear stresses. Third, the fracturing sequence for multiwell completion is of critical importance. Among three multiwell-completion schemes (i.e., sequential, zipper, and simultaneous fracturing), the zipper-fracturing technique achieves the best fracturing effectiveness for this case study. Fourth, the effect of stress perturbation on NFs can be quite different, depending on the position relative to the created stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). The coupled model significantly improves our understanding of multiwell-fracturing treatments and then provides us with a means to optimize the multiwell completion, enhancing fracture complexity to effectively improve productivity.|","Coupled Model, Fracture Complexity, Hydraulic Fracturing"

Suction Embedded Plate Anchors (SEPLA) have been used as an economical and efficient foundation system in deep waters in support of offshore oil and gas energy development. These anchoring elements are also being considered for support of the Marine Hydrokinetics devices deployment. In the majority of earlier research for SEPLA, an ideal keying procedure was assumed. During the ideal keying procedure, a plate anchor is rotated until it become nearly perpendicular to the pull out direction. In this situation, the presumption is the maximum soil resistance is mobilized. However, reaching such ideal condition is not always feasible. During an imperfect keying process, plates are not completely perpendicular to the pullout direction and have an inclination with an angle of (<U+03B8>) toward the ideal direction. Work in this paper presents the effect of imperfect keying, based on <U+03B8>-magnitude on the pullout capacity. The effect of imperfect keying is investigated using a 3D numerical analysis. SEPLA with a vertical pull out load is studied, and the inclination of the plate is considered between 5 and 30 degrees. The reduction in the breakout factor in comparison with the ideal scenario is presented at different inclination angles. These results can be used to inform the selection of a representative factor of safety during the design of SEPLA as an anchoring foundation system.
INTRODUCTION
Suction Embedded Plate Anchors (SEPLA) are plate anchors that are installed onto the seabed by using a suction caisson. Since 1988, SEPLA approach has been used as an economical and efficient foundation system in deep waters (>2000m). SEPLA uses the advantage of suction caissons installation approach (known penetration depth and geographical location) and vertically loaded anchors (VLA) (lower cost) while it avoids the disadvantages of using large, heavy, costly to handle and imprecise positioning of comparable anchoring elements (Brown, Wong, and Audibert 2011).|","Keying, Clay,  Finite Elements,  Plate Anchors,  Suction"

Sand production is one of the critical research subjects in the petroleum industry. In the oil and gas industry, the production of sand particles associated with the reservoir hydrocarbons has become one of the most common problems a well may experience during reservoir lifetime. 
Sand production occurs in many fields across the world. This is easily seen in wells in the Niger Delta, Gulf of Mexico, Oman, Canada, Venezuela, Indonesia, Egypt, Trinidad and myriads of other places prolific to sanding. Managing sand production and ultimately its control in the oil and gas industry has been more or less a recurring problem. To fully understand the nature of sanding in an ingenuous way for sand control strategy, it is necessary to predict the conditions at which sanding occurs. Because so much have not been done in the implementation of the support vector machines for the prediction of the sanding onset in petroleum reservoirs, we are, for the first time, applying a robust approach, a binary classification problem approach for the prediction of sanding onset in petroleum reservoirs in the Niger Delta Region. By and Large, for the first time, the support vector machines (SVMs) classification approach, is used to identify whether sand will be produced or not in a hydrocarbon reservoir. The model presented in this paper takes into account different parameters (rock, fluid, geotechnical and other data) that may play a role in sanding. The performance of the proposed SVM model is verified using field data. 
It is shown that the developed model can accurately predict the sand production in actual field conditions. The results of this study indicate that the implementation of SVM methodology can effectively help engineers to make a proactive sand control plan with insignificant impairment to hydrocarbon production from subsurface reservoirs.|",""

Retrograde Gas Condensate reservoirs are economically valuable assets but constitute a complex system in its management and development. Condensate banking due to liquid condensation below the dew point pressure raises technical and economic concerns in unlocking reservoir potentials. As pressure decreases with production below the dew point, liquid drop out phenomena is inevitable. This has two major consequences for an operator. First, the condensation of liquid/condensates which are immobile and remains trapped in the reservoir pores due to capillary-induced interfacial tension creates a permanent formation damage/impairment signified by a reduction in gas relative permeability and productivity. Secondly, the bulk of heavier and valuable components are lost to the pores of the reservoir rock. In this study, the interactions among fluid flow and reservoir rock properties were integrated in modeling and simulation of a retrograde gas condensate reservoir undergoing gas cycling. Economic evaluations based on reservoir performance indicate that, with gas cycling, a 70% and 90% recovery in condensate and gas respectively with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 41% is feasible.|",""

Sandstone formations that have potential to produce sand during the life of the well account for a significant fraction of global recoverable volumes of oil and gas resources. The economics, environmental and safety implications of sand problems are critical enough to justify good knowledge of the potential for sand failure and production. Reliable evaluation of potential sand production is required to identify the needs for and the specification of sand-exclusion equipment during the project execution phase. 
To address these challenges, this paper presents a simple workflow that is premised on the petro-elasticity of the formation. Specifically, the proposed workflow uses cross plots of compressional sonic logs and density logs on reservoir-by-reservoir and well-by-well basis. From a petro-elastic standpoint, compressional sonic logs contain information on travel time required for sound waves to travel through the subject formation. The fundamental relationship between formation compaction (strength) and porosity has been explored to establish the trend of compaction, hence vulnerability of a sandstone formation to failure. 
In illustrating the applicability of the proposed concepts and workflow, some field examples from the Niger Delta are presented. Using wells with known history of sand failure and production, the workflow has been applied retroactively. The methodology presented is very useful for establishment of a quick screening sand control requirement. From a qualitative standpoint, it is found that the performances of the proposed workflow are in reasonable agreement with the history of sand failure and production in the example wells.|","Document Type

Nowadays, there is still no existing specification for bearing capacity of caisson in engineering design. In order to study the bearing capacity of caisson, model tests were respectively conducted using two kinds of kaolin samples with different preconsolidated pressures. Moreover, Finite Element Method (FEM) and bearing capacity formulas were adopted in analysis of bearing capacity. The results obtained by those formulas and FEM were compared with those of the model tests. The FEM obtained the closer results with the tests than those of formulas. Besides, the bearing capacity factors were also concluded in this paper.
INTRODUCTION
Suction caisson is a large, hollow, cylindrical steel or concrete structure which resembles upturned buckets. It is also known as suction anchor, suction pile, or bucket foundation. The principle of the suction caisson technique is to generate downward net force by applying suction inside a sealed cylindrical caisson, which makes the caisson sinking into the seabed soil. After the suction is removed, the construction of the caisson foundation is finished even without treating the soft soil in the deep sea, which has economic and environmental advantage over the traditional driven piles method. In recent years, suction caisson has been successfully employed in many projects, including mooring anchors (Andersen and Jostad, 1999; Randolph et al., 2011), breakwaters or sea walls (Chu et al., 2012), offshore platforms (Zhang and Ding, 2011), and foundation for wind turbines in deep waters (Byrne, B. W. and Cassidy, M. J., 2002; Houlsby, G. T. and Byrne, B. W. Houlsby et al., 2005).
When sinking the caisson, the pressure difference between the caisson cavity and the external seawater could contribute to the driven force. The main design challenge for this case is to penetrate the caisson deep enough into the seabed so that it can provide the required bearing capacity and keep the displacement within acceptable value under the design loading. Some centrifuge tests were carried on with steel suction caissons (Fuglsang and Steensen-Bach, 1991; Clukey and Morrison, 1993, 1995; Watson and Randolph, 1997; Allersma et al., 2000), and the previous studies also focused more on the steel ones. Concrete caissons have many advantages over the steel ones, such as (1) higher erosion resistance, (2) lower construction cost, and (3) easier construction of a seamless whole structure. However, in concrete caissons, the ratios of skirt thickness to external diameter are usually very high (Chu et al., 2012).|","Concrete suction caisson,  bearing capacity,  model test,  FEM"

A computationally efficient model including the dynamic wind turbine bucket-soil interaction is proposed. In this model, Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is used to depict the tower of the turbine, bucket foundation is modeled as a rigid shell due to its small length to radius ratio; while the seabed is modeled as an elastic soil half-space. Analytical frequency dependent dynamic impedance functions will be used to model the effect of dynamic soil-structure interaction. The natural frequencies and dynamic responses of the whole system at various loading conditions will be studied. The impedance matrix model is validated by comparing with a coupled finite-infinite element model.
INTRODUCTION
Scientifically develop and utilize offshore wind power energy has a special significance on improving the country's energy structure, alleviating such problems as environmental pollution. Ensure the safety of the offshore wind turbines in the life cycle operation is the fundamental guarantee of offshore wind power development. In order to better use of the offshore wind, the megawatts of turbines increase continuously these days. With the tower becoming higher and slender, the whole structures become softer and weaker, coupled with its operation process will be affected by wind, wave, flow, earthquake and its operation loads at various low frequencies, if poorly designed, resonant fatigue failure can easily develop. In order to anchor the wind turbines to the seabed, cylindrical bucket foundations (like a reversed bucket, and can be installed easily and quickly by pumping water out of the bucket to create pressure difference) have attracted a lot of interest. Bucket foundation is a real sense of environmental friendly foundation, as there is no noise when installation, small impact on the environment, and can be recycled many times repeatedly. Besides, High cost has become a serious problem for offshore wind power industry. Bucket foundation has the potential to save the industry for its low construction costs. However, compared to the numerous studies on the dynamic characters of piles (Achmus, et al., 2009; Bisoi, and Haldar, 2014; Gazetas and Dobry, 1984; Lombardi, et al., 2013; Pak and Jennings, 1987; Novak, 1974; Rajapakse and Shah, 1987; Zania, 2014), there are quite few studies on the dynamics responses of bucket foundations: Liingaard et al. (2007) studied the impedance of bucket foundations in a viscoelastic medium using the coupled BEM-FEM method. He et al.(2016, 2017) obtained both the vertical, and the coupled horizontal and rocking impedance functions for a rigid cylindrical shell embedded in seabed, using a rigorous analytical method. Besides, Field trials of bucket foundations both in clay and sand are studied by Houlsby et al.(2005, 2006) and the complex rotational dynamic impedance is obtained.|","Impedance functions, Bucket foundation,  Soil Structure interaction"

Fundamentals of the method are given, including contact detection and forces calculation. Artificial ridges are created into the simulation domain by means of floating-up technique. Hull geometry is introduced into the model, handling non-convex bodies as composites of convex bodies. Hydrostatic properties are calculated according to actual draft, pitch and roll angles.

INTRODUCTION
Sea ice ridges are one of the most difficult obstacles encountered in ice-covered seas. When two ice sheets come into contact, they break and small pieces of ice accumulate along a line, creating large floating structures embedded in the ice sheet. With a keel depth sometimes exceeding 30m, ice ridges represent considerable obstacles to ship navigation, but also to floating structures and vessels under dynamic positioning operations. In the context of increasing activities in Polar Regions, the present work focuses on the estimation of the ridge breaking ability of ships and offshore structures. The paper discusses the working principle of newly-developed simulation software based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM).
Numerical modeling of ice ridge creation, ice ridge breaking and ice ridge/structure interaction are relatively new research topics. Naval architects and ship designers at early design stage are often interested in assessing the capability of a vessel to navigate through ice ridges. For this purpose Ehle (2011) developed a method that enables calculating ship's velocity and resistance during ridge breaking, taking into account hull bow shape and ship's power. Numerical implementation has been performed by Hisette (2014). The aforementioned method is based on available analytical formulae and results of model tests in ice tank but does not allow visualization of ship behavior in the ridge and simulate different possible interaction scenarios.|","Arctic,  Discrete Element Simulation,  Icebreaker,  Ice Ridges"

Determining the response of the laterally loaded piles analytically is one of the challenging problems due to the complexity of soil-pile interaction models and the difficulty to solve governing difference equations. In this paper, a general solution for laterally loaded piles is proposed for multilayered soil systems with any forms of p-y curves. The generalized solution of laterally loaded pile was formulated based on the transfer matrix approach. The elastic and plastic transfer matrix coefficients for pile segment at any depth were analytically obtained through Laplace transformation. Validations of the proposed method are performed through comparison between our predictions with the results from existing methods. Good agreements are reached which implies that the proposed method can be employed as an alternative method to effectively evaluate the response of laterally loaded piles. Moreover, a parametric study on pile bending stiffness is performed to investigate its influence on the ultimate capacity of laterally loaded piles in the same soil profile. We found that these three piles with different bending stiffness would have the same limit state distribution of soil resistance along the pile with the same rotation center below soil surface, which will yield identical ultimate lateral bearing capacity and corresponding maximum bending moment (Mmax) for the piles. Under the concept of the maximum bending moment (Mmax), it would be more rigorous to define a rigid pile when plastic moment Mp along the pile exceeds Mmax and to define a flexible pile when Mp is less than Mmax, especially for piles in multilayered soil deposits.
INTRODUCTION
Piles are extensively used as foundations not only to transfer vertical loads from upper structures to surrounding soils, but also to bear horizontal forces and moments simultaneously. In offshore engineering (e.g., offshore wind turbine and oil production platforms), the piles are mainly designed to resist the lateral loads mainly from the wind to the upper structure, water pressure and seismic activity to the foundation (Basu et al., 2008). The subgrade reaction concept of laterally loaded piles was introduced since the piles behave as Winkler model against lateral loads. To determine the pile responses rigorously is one of the challenging problems due to the complexity of soil-pile interaction and difficulty of solving the governing fourth order differential equation on the basis of subgrade reaction approach.|","soil-pile interaction,  ultimate lateral bearing capacity, Laterally loaded pile,  Laplace transformation,  transfer matrix coefficient,  transfer matrix method"

Estimation of undrained uplift capacity of buried offshore pipelines involves several soil, structure and interface parameters. For buried pipelines, undrained uplift capacity is significantly influenced by pipesoil interface roughness coefficient. Design guidelines for obtaining uplift capacity exist in literature for perfectly smooth and fully rough interfaces. This paper aims at estimating undrained uplift capacity over entire range of interface roughness coefficient. For this purpose, a number of finite element analyses have been carried out by varying interface roughness coefficient and other parameters. The obtained results are validated with plasticity theory based solutions. Present study shows that the simplistic approach of linear interpolation of capacity with roughness coefficient leads to slightly conservative design.
INTRODUCTION
Global energy demand has increased manyfold over the past few decades and as a result offshore hydrocarbon extraction facilities are being built both at nearshore and deep water regions. Offshore pipeline systems are one of the vital components of oil and gas extraction facilities as they are used for transporting oil within fields and also to shore. These pipelines, laid on the seabed at ambient temperature, are either placed on the seabed (on-bottom pipelines used in deep water locations) or are buried into the seabed using trenching. Burying the pipes enhances its thermal insulation and thus helps in achieving higher flow velocities within the pipelines. Burial also protects these pipelines from hydrodynamic wave loading and fishing activities. Since, these pipes carry oil and gas at high temperatures compared to the temperature at which they were laid, they tend to elongate. However, elongation in the longitudinal direction is resisted by frictional resistances developed in the environing soil mass and thus the pipes get subjected to compressive forces. For buried pipelines, this axial compressive force is at times large enough to induce buckling in the upward direction which is resisted predominantly due to shear strength of soil, self-weight of soil cover and mobilized interface tension. As the pipe undergoes uplift, shear stresses start building within the adjoining soil mass resulting in increase in soil resistance till it reaches a peak. The post-peak soil response often shows a decrease in resistance. The maximum uplift resistance offered by the soil during pipe uplift is termed as uplift capacity (which excludes the pipe weight as per common definition). Upheaval buckling can often occur under undrained conditions in soil depending on rate of loading, soil permeability and drainage conditions. Thus, estimation of undrained uplift capacity and optimal burial depth becomes essential as pipeline design is an important economic factor in offshore industries.|","buried pipelines,  undrained uplift capacity,  interface roughness coefficient,  offshore geotechniques,  numerical modeling"

This paper presents a dynamic large deformation finite element approach based on frequent mesh regeneration within the effective stress framework and investigates the penetration behavior of a dynamically installed anchor in normally consolidated kaolin clay. The strain rate dependency of clayey soil is represented by an elasto-viscoplastic soil model. The numerical model is validated against existing centrifuge testing data. The anchor deceleration profiles and the development of excess pore pressures around the anchor are discussed. A parameteric study is then conducted to explore the effect of impact velocity on the final embedment depth.
INTRODUCTION
Recently introduced dynamically installed anchors (DIAs) have been regarded as a cost-effective anchoring solution for floating structures in deep waters. They are usually rocket shaped equipped with three or four fins at the trailing edge. The DIAs are installed by releasing from a design height above the mudline. The anchor is then penetrated into the seabed via the kinetic energy gained during the free-fall in the water column and the anchor's submerged self-weight. The quick installation process can be regarded as nearly undrained conditions, especially in clayey sediments, and significant excess pore water pressures are accumulated around the anchor. An anchor installation is generally followed by a set-up period, prior to applying operational loadings, allowing dissipation of the installation induced excess pore water pressures up to some degree.
To date, the dynamic penetration behavior of DIAs have been explored mainly through field trials and centrifuge tests, while a limited number of numerical studies have been conducted. The anchor penetration from the mudline to the final embedment depth was replicated using a computational fluid dynamics method (Raie and Tassoulas, 2009) and large deformation finite element (LDFE) approaches (Nazem et al., 2012; Kim and Hossain, 2015; Kim et al., 2015a, 2015b; Liu et al., 2016). However, almost all previous numerical analyses on DIA installation were within the framework of total stress, in which the development of excess pore pressures during penetration and the subsequent dissipation could not be considered directly. This limitation may lead to an inaccurate prediction of pullout capacities at an operational stage, which is dictated largely by the degree of dissipation or consolidation, unless an artificially increased undrained shear strength of the adjacent soil is considered (Kim and Hossain, 2016, 2017). Therefore, an effective stress analysis is required to gain comprehensive interpretation of the soil response during dynamic installation and to compute accurate capacity under operational loading.|","dynamically installed anchors,  pore pressures,  strain rate dependency,  effective stress,  large deformation finite element analyses"

In this paper, the undrained vertical bearing capacity of subsea pipelines installed on a surficial high shear strength crust overlying a soft clay is studied. A large deformation finite element methodology which incorporates frequent remeshing and mapping of all state variables from an old geometry to a new geometry was adopted for the current work. Various relative shear strength ratios of crust to underlying soil and pipe diameters were considered for the parametric study. It was observed from the results that, the presence of crustal layer significantly influences the vertical penetration response of pipelines.
INTRODUCTION
As the offshore industry is exploring hydrocarbon reserves in remote geographic locations, a thin layer of crust exhibiting an abnormal shear strength overlying a normally-consolidated clay deposit is often encountered. The high shear strength in the crust region can be attributed to the biochemical activities of micro-organisms living in the vicinity of the seabed (Kuo and Bolton, 2013). Deepwater subsea pipelines carrying hydrocarbons at very high temperature and pressure are often installed on this crustal sediments directly without any trenching or additional protection. The vertical penetration of these pipelines during the installation process is generally an undrained phenomenon involving formation of soil heave around the pipe that influences the vertical bearing capacity. It is very essential to accurately assess the penetration response of pipelines installed on a surficial crust for the design of on-bottom submarine pipelines.
In the recent past, researchers have conducted several studies on the vertical bearing capacity of subsea pipelines either using classical plasticity solutions (Randolph and White, 2008b, Martin and White, 2012) or small strain analysis by applying finite element technique (Aubeny et al., 2005; Merifield et al., 2008, 2009). Experimental studies based on centrifuge modelling (Dingle et al., 2008) were also carried out to understand the pipe-soil behavior albeit they are limited to specific cases. Numerical finite element analyses adopting large deformation approach (Wang et al., 2010; Chatterjee, 2012) was also undertaken to examine the much more realistic scenario of vertical penetration response of seabed pipelines on clay seabed. During installation of a pipeline on the seabed, the pipe embeds into the seafloor because of its self-weight and dynamic oscillations of laying vessels (Randolph and White, 2008a). The soil heave developed due to penetration process has a remarkable influence on lateral pipe-soil behavior (White and Cheuk, 2008; White and Dingle, 2011). Very few studies available in the literature consider the effect of high strength crustal layer present near the seabed on the penetration response of subsea pipelines. Park et al. (2010) determined the bearing capacity factors for shallow foundation on a stiff non-homogeneous crustal layer overlying a very soft clay. Morrow and Bransby (2011) conducted a series of small strain analyses using finite difference method to study the effect of different shear strength profiles and crust shear strength on vertical penetration of seabed pipelines. Martin and White (2012) considered the pipe as a rigid plane strain element and studied the ultimate bearing capacity using limit analysis. Recently Feng et al. (2015) examined the influence of near surface crust on the ultimate load carrying capacity of mudmats considering loads from all six directions.|","finite element,  large deformation, Pipelines,  crust,  bearing capacity"

Suction Bucket Jackets (SBJ) are found as a suitable alternative to driven piles for the support of foundations for offshore wind energy converters. In the case of jackets or multipods, a predominant vertical load is to be expected. The effect of such a tensile loading is the generation of suction in the soil inside the bucket which leads to an increment of tensile capacity. This paper aims to study the bearing behaviour of a suction foundation by taking into account how the soil permeability and the loading rate influence the foundation behaviour. Moreover, after submitting the structure to a storm load, the bearing capacity is studied again, in order to see the effect of such a load on the bucket's bearing behaviour. This study is carried out by means of Finite Element numerical simulations based on the formulation of Biot's equations combined with a constitutive model that reproduces the key aspects of cyclic soil behaviour in the frame of Generalized Plasticity.
INTRODUCTION
The urgent need for a clean and sustainable energy, followed by the progressive depletion of the finite hydrocarbon reserves, has lead several worldwide countries to aim to achieve energetic goals by exploiting wind energy, where offshore turbines play a major role. For geotechnical engineers, the design of foundations for offshore wind energy turbines faces a series of important challenges, such as dimensions and their high ratio of lateral and vertical loads. For this reason, due to the growing interest in exploiting deep waters and the site characteristics, different strategies are taken into consideration.
Even though traditionally offshore wind turbines are founded on gravity concrete foundations or monopiles, research projects on suction caissons (Byrne, 2000; Feld, 2001; Houlsby, Ibsen, & Byrne, 2005) have largely found this technology as a valid alternative. Suction caissons are originally used in the oil and gas industry for offshore structures and however the concept is well known, in the case of wind energy turbines, load conditions change drastically. The loads typically found in these structures are cyclic and a combination of a relatively low vertical load combined with horizontal forces inducing an overturning moment. In the design of such structures, it is definitively of most importance to consider the cycling effects, not just with pseudo-static approaches where the cyclic degradation it is just an estimation of the accumulated displacements without reflecting the actual physical state. On the other hand, hydromechanical coupling in the saturated sea bed is often not taken into account for practical design and the effects of the development of excess pore pressure around or inside the caisson on a cycle by cycle basis are often neglected. Moreover, the distribution of total stresses within the soil may be changing continuously because of the reduction of soil stiffness when the pore pressure increases (Taiebat, 1999). It is therefore not possible to determine the failure stress state from the initial conditions at the beginning of the cyclic load and the need to consider a fully coupled nature of the problem in hand by using a general framework is suggested.|","Finite Element Method,  suction bucket,  sand,  numerical simulation,  generalized plasticity,  tensile capacity,  offshore wind energy converter"

The piles used for jacket type foundation for an offshore wind turbine are subjected to highly cyclic tension and compressive loading. The pile capacity under cyclic axial loading decreases with number of loading cycles due to the reduction of pile shaft resistance. A numerical simulation scheme is presented, which allows the calculation of pile capacity degradation (CDM) due to cyclic loading for driven steel piles. The volume compaction of soil near pile surface during the cyclic loading is determined from cyclic simple shear test results and is then applied to the pile-soil system.
From the limited number of tests available, interaction diagrams have been developed, which give the number of load cycles leading to failure dependent on the mean load and the amplitude of the cyclic load portion, both related to the static pile capacity. However, such diagrams cannot account for different soil conditions or pile geometry and pile stiffness. The calculation results for piles with three different embedded lengths in sandy soil under cyclic loading in tension are presented and compared with the existing interaction diagrams. Finally, recommendations regarding necessary further investigations and improvements of the method are given.
INTRODUCTION
Jacket type foundation of offshore wind turbines are supported by steel pipe piles located at the edges of the foot print area (Fig.1). These piles are often subjected to intensive cyclic axial loads due to wind and waves. A loading time series applied on the pile (pile 4 in Fig. 1) of a reference wind turbine is presented in Fig. 2. Under cyclic axial load, the pile capacity decreases with increasing number of load cycles. This occurs mainly due to a decrease of ultimate skin friction, whereas the tip resistance is believed to remain almost unchanged.
Although numerous studies have been carried out regarding pile capacity under cyclic loading, no approved calculation approach yet exists to determine the decrease of capacity dependent on cyclic load magnitude and number of load cycles. At the institute of the first three authors, a new simulation scheme was developed, which allows the calculation of pile capacity degradation (CDM) due to cyclic loading for driven steel piles [Abdel-Rahman & Achmus (2011a & 2011b), Abdel-Rahman et al.(2014a & 2014b), Achmus et al. (2015)]. Herein, the system behavior under the first loading and unloading step is simulated by a finite element calculation. From the resulting shear strain amplitude in each soil element, the volume compaction to be expected under the considered number of load cycles is predicted by an approach derived from cyclic simple shear tests conducted with sandy soil by Silver & Seed (1971). This volume compaction is applied to the elements in the finite element model and results in a reduction of the normal stresses acting on the pile. In a subsequent loading stage, the (reduced) post-cyclic capacity of the pile is determined.|","Jacket type foundation,  axial load, Offshore wind,  capacity degradation method (CDM)"

Three-dimensional finite element (FE) analysis of axial-vertical interaction behavior of buried pipelines with dense sand is performed.

In addition, a user subroutine is utilized to capture the pressure dependent stress<U+2212>strain behavior of dense sand. The numerical model is verified by comparing the results with experimental results available in literature. The effects of embedment ratio, angle of attack, and pipeline surface roughness are discussed. Normalized axial-vertical interaction diagram is also proposed.
INTRODUCTION
The use of subsea buried pipelines for transporting high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) hydrocarbons has been increased rapidly in recent years all around the globe. The safe operation of such buried pipelines is a prime concern for the oil and gas industry. The minimization of adverse effects on the mechanical response and integrity of pipelines due to geohazards is one of the major challenges. Permanent ground deformation due to geohazards such as landslide and earthquake can cause relative movement between the pipeline and surrounding soil which may impose geotechnical loads onto the pipe. The geotechnical loads onto the pipe increases the level of stress and strain in the pipeline which may hinder the safe operation of the pipeline system.
In the current engineering practice (e.g. ALA, 2001; PRCI, 2004), the soil/pipe interaction is idealized by structural modeling. The mechanical response of pipeline is assessed by specialized beam elements and the soil behavior is evaluated by discrete nonlinear springs with load-displacement relationships provided for principal directions (i.e. longitudinal or axial, lateral or horizontal, vertical upward, and vertical downward). These springs are independent and they cannot account for the combined effects during a 3D soil/pipe relative movement (i.e. movement under oblique loading) despite the fact that in reality the movement can occur in all three directions simultaneously. The oblique soil/pipe interaction cases include axial-lateral, axial-vertical, and lateral-vertical soil/pipe relative movements which are specific cases of a general 3D (axial-lateral-vertical) soil/pipe relative movement.|","Buried pipeline,  dense sand,  modified Mohr-Coulomb model,  axial-vertical interaction,  numerical analysis,  Abaqus"

Accurate determination of soil in situ shear strength using the T-bar penetrometer requires full understanding of the soil flow characteristics around the T-bar, including the three-dimensional soil flow near the ends of the T-bar. The conventional plane strain solution of the T-bar resistance factor ignores the shearing that takes place around the ends of the T-bar, thus may blemish the accuracy of the interpretation. A three-dimensional finite element model has been built to investigate the end effect of the T-bar on its flow mechanism and resistance factor. The effects of the T-bar aspect ratio and surface roughness on resistance factor are explored extensively. A new interpretation formula of the T-bar resistance factor is proposed as a function of the T-bar aspect ratio and roughness.
INTRODUCTION
The recent exploration of hydrocarbon fields in deep water has placed more reliance on in situ testing, such as vane shear testing and push-in penetrometer testing, due to the difficulty and high cost of obtaining high-quality soil sample for laboratory testing. The T-bar penetrometer was initially developed for characterizing soft fine-grained soils in centrifuge testing (Stewart and Randolph, 1991) and has been adopted in the field for site investigation since the 1990s (Stewart and Randolph, 1994). Compared to the conventional push-in penetrometer, i.e. cone penetrometer, the advantage of the T-bar penetrometer includes: (a) a 5~10 times larger projected area, leading to higher resolution of penetration resistance in soft sediments; (b) negligible effect of overburden pressure and soil rigidity index on penetration resistance due to the full-flow mechanism (Lu, 2004, Zhou and Randolph, 2009). The T-bar penetrometer comprises a cylinder bar attached perpendicularly to the end of a smooth shaft, where a load cell has been embedded, as shown in Fig. 1. Along with increasingly being used in offshore in situ site investigation, T-bar is also frequently used for soil strength determination in laboratory and centrifuge tests (Hossain et al., 2005, Dingle et al., 2008). Therefore, an accurate interpretation procedure of the T-bar data is of great interest to the geotechnical community.|","resistance factor,  end effect, T-bar penetrometer,  interpretation,  flow mechanism"

Accordingly, information is required to improve the regional knowledge of geopressures and for the calibration of functions aimed at optimising pre-drill pore pressure estimates for future wells. The Central North Sea, with its vast number of HPHT wells, pressure data, drilling information and documented operational experiences in exploration, drilling, development and production activities stands in a good stead as a ""geopressure laboratory"" for the fine-tuning of pore pressure prediction concepts, improvement of current geopressure practices and ultimately guide investment and operational decisions in the unexplored areas of the basin itself and elsewhere as geological realities could permit. For this reason, this study utilised downhole pressure-related data and wireline logs to evaluate the pressure regimes in the Central North Sea. The approach involved the quantification of overpressures using standard pore pressure prediction methods that make use of the density and velocity logs of mudstones. The results show that the estimated pore pressure profiles are consistent with measured pressure data in the Cenozoic formations, which makes it reasonable to assume that disequilibrium compaction is the cause of overpressure in this shallow section of the wells. Going deeper into the wells, within the sub-Chalk section, typical calibration parameters from log data could not be used to achieve reliable estimates of overpressures as was the case in the Cenozoic section. Remarkably, while it is possible to adjust the Eaton exponents in order to match estimates with measured data, a wide range of exponent values of between 4.0 and 7.0 is however required. The implication is that there is no systematic variation of the Eaton exponents with the amount of overpressure or depth of burial of the sub-Chalk strata.|",""

Geomechanical related drilling problems have always been the major cause of geologic non-productive time (GNPT) in drilling operations (complex and conventional wells) especially in deepwater basins, where billions of dollars are being spent while searching for solutions to drilling problems and developing remediation plans. Thus, real-time pore pressure monitoring is critical to ensuring safe and successful drilling operations. Typically, the only information available to the drilling engineer prior to well spudding are offset wells and predrill models (1D or 3D) built from offset wells data and other sources (regional, sub-regional, seismic etc.) and no two (2) wells are ever the same in terms of behavior, then the need for real time pore pressure (PP), Fracture Gradient (FG) and Wellbore Stability (WBS) monitoring in ground-truthing and calibrating the predrill model cannot be overemphasized. This paper describes how modern technology, innovative approaches, monitoring well behavior and effective communication helped in meeting the challenges of real time pore pressure and fracture gradient surveillance while drilling in environments with very narrow drilling mud weight windows, and where there is limited information on the formation pore pressure, subsurface rock properties, in-situ stresses and basins with little to no offset well information. Integration of multiple data sets [appropriate logging while drilling data (LWD), drill cuttings, drilling parameters, gas in mud, equivalent circulating density (ECD) and equivalent static density (ESD)] and well behavior/events to support and calibrate predrill petrophysical log-based pore pressure prediction models significantly aided in drilling two complex wells safely and successfully to the target reservoirs in cost effective manner in the study area. Mechanical cavings and reamer affected cuttings were easily differentiated from normal drill cuttings, and potential kick predicted even in the absence of pipe connection gas; where there is no sign of underbalanced drilling using predrill pore pressure/ fracture gradient/wellbore stability (PPFG/WBS) petrophysical logs-based model. The model formed the basis for the critical drilling operations decisions taken in these case studies; mud weight increase, setting intermediate casing shallower than planned, and well deepening. Factors such as abnormal high rate of penetration (ROP), drilling mud properties, high temperature, salinity and calcite cementation affect petrophysical data, thus relying only on the logging while drilling (LWD) data such as gamma ray, resistivity, and sonic logs for real-time pore pressure and fracture gradient analysis, especially when drilling deep wells is not recommended. The innovative approaches presented in this paper via its workflow compensate for potential limitations of LWD data.|",""

The use of gas injection and storage approach in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is receiving increasing attention as an efficient solution to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, improve production by means of increasing static reservoir pressure, and allow optimized utilization of produced hydrocarbons as a function of actual consumption. 
During gas injection a geological trap (i.e. active or abandoned reservoir) is used to store excess gas that can be eventually produced for future utilization. This process generates changes in pore pressure within the rock's porous space, affecting simultaneously the state of stress inside the reservoir and in its surroundings. These changes of the state of stress can be at the origin of instability mechanisms associated with fracturing inside and outside the reservoir and of reactivation of existing discontinuities (faults and fractures). If reactivation occurs within the caprock, this could lead to possible reservoir sealing failure and thus leakage of the stored gas at surface. Therefore, deformation of caprock and fault integrity must be assessed to properly manage containment performance and leakage-related risks. Given the intrinsic 3D nature of the problem, to ascertain the feasibility of injecting and/or re-injecting natural gas back into producing formations, it is essential to perform numerical simulations to capture the link between concomitant pressurization and /or depletion. The modelling is done with a 3D reservoir simulator and in-situ stresses changes are obtained by means of a 3D coupled reservoir geomechanics simulator. 
A feasibility study of gas injection and storage in a producing reservoir was performed using coupled geomechanics modeling within an E&P software platform. The process started from single-well geomechanics analysis and then passed through 3D structural characterization and properties modeling, in-situ preproduction stress modeling, dynamic simulation, and, finally, injection modeling. Analyses were carried out using injection pressure modeled dynamically in an industry-standard reservoir simulator. This allowed various injection scenarios to be explored, providing a 4D characterization at various time steps in the future of the state of stress within the reservoir and its surroundings. Results highlighted the main risks, which are related to loss of sealing for the caprock and reactivation of induced faults, as well as uncertainties associated with input parameters.|",""

Post-drill pore pressure and fracture gradient analyses were carried out in an offshore hydrocarbon field, of Niger DeltaBasin, the G-field, using petrophysical logs, drilling parameters and pressure data. Four wells were analyzed and the results from the analysis will serve as a look back in building a Pre-Spud pore pressure and fracture gradient model for future drilling of exploration and production wells. The overburden gradient and normal compaction trend were generated based on an empirical formula. The pore pressure gradients were computed using the Eaton’s and Miller’s method respectively. Mud weights, drilling parameters and drilling events were used to calibrate the pore pressure gradients. Fracture gradient was computed using Mathews and Kelly’s method with pore pressure definitive, overburden gradient and effective stress ratio as the inputs. Based on the empirical methods, pressure transition zones were detected across the four wells with three (3) pressure ramps of magnitude of 1.23 ppg (Pound Per Gallon), 2.55ppg and 1.52ppg respectively. Pore pressure gradient model generated from the study revealed normally pressured zones at the shallower part of the unconfined section in all the wells within the range of 870 and 6273 feet TVD (True Vertical Depth) with an average shale pore pressure of 8.4ppg for Well 1,4715 and 9145 feet TVD with an average shale pore pressure of 8.5ppg for Well 2, 2614 and 7736 feet TVD with an average shale pore pressure of 8.39ppg for Well 3 and 4227 and 7972 feet TVD with an average shale pore pressure of 8.4ppg for Well 4. The top of the overpressured zones (>0.47 Psi/ft) (9ppg) were established across the four wells. The analysis of pore pressure of the field shows that the depth to the overpressured zones ranges from 7498 to 8859 feet TVD for Well 1,9825 and 13582 feet TVD for Well2, 7741 and 12264 TVD for Well 3 and 8307 and 12220 feet TVD for Well 4.|","Document Type

This uncertainty is greatest at in situ reservoir conditions and when attempting to predict the permeability of fresh fractures created via tensile stress or critical stress shearing. In this study, we measure permeability of shale specimens shear fractured at stressed conditions and combine these measurements with concurrent x-ray tomographic characterization of the fracture systems. The fractures were created using a specialized triaxial system configured for either direct-shear fracturing. Confining stresses up to 30 MPa (4400 psi) were used to simulate moderate reservoir depths. The body of the apparatus is an aluminum coreholder that permits acquisition of simultaneous x-ray radiography or tomography data together with permeability measurements and shear fracture displacement. In both clay-rich Utica and carbonate-rich Marcellus shale, we observe that increasing confining stress during fracturing results in significant decreases in fracture permeability ranging over 3 to 4 orders of magnitude. In a clay-rich direct-shear specimen, negligible permeability development was observed at confining stress of 22 MPa (3200 psi) despite significant deformation. The large variations in permeability as a function of stress at fracture initiation are in contrast to the lesser effect of changes in confining stress on already-formed fractures with a corresponding range of one to two orders of magnitude. These observations of permeability are corroborated by x-ray radiography and tomography that show a reduction in fracture aperture with increasing stress. |Introduction |Hydrocarbon production from unconventional shale resources depends on a number of factors including the extent and penetration of the hydraulic fractures (HF), distribution of proppant, the hydrocarbon content, matrix properties, pre-existing fractures, etc. A number of studies have concluded that existing, potentially reactivated fracture systems must contribute hydrocarbon to account for observed HF productivity (e.g., Gale et al. 2007; Johri and Zoback 2013; McClure and Horne 2014). However, little is known about “natural” shear fracture permeability and the changes in fracture permeability in response to changing stress or fracture reactivation. This results in significant uncertainty in the potential role of natural fractures in hydrocarbon production. For example, discrete fracture network models of unconventional reservoirs use an array of natural fractures to reproduce production data (Karra et al. 2015).|",""

The nano-darcy permeability of organic shale currently precludes the field application of all proposed methods to increase hydrocarbon recovery by gas or liquid flooding. A new technique developed by the authors and named “Optimized Modified Zipper Frac” (OMZF) avoids this limitation by using stress shadowing to lessen the magnitude difference between horizontal stresses in the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) before it gets fractured, thereby maximizing the SRV’s complexity and overall permeability. |When OMZF is used to recover hydrocarbons from shale, a stage of hydraulic fractures (preferably fat-propped fractures) are first created near the toe of a horizontal well. A second stage is then created and ballooned on the same well at a designed distance from the first stage. Then, a third stage is created along an adjacent well midway and staggered between stages one and two. This operational sequence is then repeated. The first two stages (along the first well) are ballooned to produce a stress shadow strong enough to maximize the complexity of the third stage (along the second well) when it is fractured. A detailed design process is presented and includes different scenarios to optimize zipper fracturing. |Reservoir simulations and field applications confirm that Texas Two-Step and Modified Zipper Frac will in fact increase the complexity and permeability of nearby fractured zones. Optimized Modified Zipper Frac will maximize these increases by optimizing the net pressure and fracture dimensions, thereby strengthen the stress shadow on zones before fractured. This will increase near wellbore complexity, overall permeability, hydrocarbon recovery, and may also allow gas injection as an EOR application. These simulations strongly suggest that unlike experimental methods that propose flooding shale cores with different fluids, OMZF is field applicable. Any increased production resulting from this work will help the petroleum industry to meet its ever-increasing demand.|",""

Pressure variations in the monitor/offset wells during hydraulic stimulation have largely been documented and can range from just a couple psi to over a thousand psi. By modeling the geomechanical impact of a propagating fracture, we were able to demonstrate that some of these observed pressure responses do not represent a hydraulic communication between the fracture and the offset well, but instead a poroelastic response to the mechanical stress induced by the fracturing process. |When a stress load is applied to a fluid-filled porous material, the pressure inside the pores will increase in response to it. In theory, the incremental pore pressure is then progressively dissipated through porous media until equilibrium is achieved. But in a shale formation, dissipation is slow enough that the excess pressure is maintained throughout the stimulation phase (undrained deformation). As a result, the poroelastic responses captured by downhole and surface pressure gauges are directly proportional to the volumetric stress perturbation induced by a propagating hydraulic fracture. |After building a geomechanical model of a propagating tensile fracture in a poro-linear-elastic material, we were able to match the poroelastic response captured in the toe of an offset well during the first stage of the stimulation of a horizontal well, and calculate the height, length, and orientation of the corresponding hydraulic fracture. Following shut-in, the induced fracture proceeds to close thus relaxing the surrounding formation and causing the poroelastic response to fall off. By simulating the coupled leak-off and frac closure process, we were able to calculate the effective permeability of the formation following stimulation. |Poroelastic Response Monitoring is showing tremendous potential in reducing the uncertainties of multi-stage fracture treatments in unconventional plays. Among its many advantages, it is based on simple well-established physical models (linear-poro-elasticity), it is much less sensitive to rock heterogeneities than pressure transient analysis, each stage can be matched separately, and the noise to signal ratio is small. Also unlike microseismic event monitoring, it directly measures the dilation of propagating hydraulic fractures.|","Document Type

Proppants are responsible for enhancing the fracture conductivity and help in maintaining high production rates. This study is focused on the measurement of long-term conductivity of proppant-packs at simulated reservoir temperature and pressure conditions. Various conductivity impairment mechanisms such as proppant crushing, fines migration, embedment, and diagenesis are investigated. |Testing was done using a conductivity cell which allows simultaneous measurement of fracture compaction and permeability. The proppant-pack performance during compression between metal and shale platens was compared. The proppant filled fracture (concentration: 0.75-3 lb/ft2) is subjected to axial load (5000 psi) to simulate closure stress. Brine (3% NaCl + 0.5% KCl) is flowed through the pack at a constant rate (3 ml/min) at 250°F over an extended duration of time (10-60 days). In this study, Ottawa sand proppant was used between platen faces fabricated from Vaca Muerta and Eagle Ford shales. |Testing between metal platens indicated the reduction in permeability with 20/40 mesh Ottawa sand (~30% over 12 days) was less than that of 60/100 mesh Ottawa sand which suffered a 99% reduction in only 4 days. |Measurements with 20/40 mesh Ottawa sand between shale platens were conducted at 1.5 lb/ ft2. Over a duration of 10 days, the Eagle Ford platens proppant-pack exhibits a greater reduction in permeability, in comparison to Vaca Muerta platens. The normalized compaction for Eagle Ford shale platens is 20% more than Vaca Muerta platens, owing to greater proppant embedment. Particle size analysis and SEM images verify proppant crushing, fines migration and embedment as dominant damage mechanisms. These factors are observed to be dependent on the shales being tested. The results suggest a substantial degradation of permeability during the initial 5 days of testing, after which the permeability appears to stabilize. Crushed proppant and dislodged shale surface particles contribute to the fines generated; a greater concentration of fines is observed downstream. For tests between Vaca Muerta platens under similar pressure and temperature conditions and 2lb/ ft2 proppant concentration, over 60 days, the permeability reduced by almost three orders of magnitude. It was also observed that growth of digenetic smectite is accelerated by making the fluid more basic (pH: 10).|",""

As a result, fractures from infill wells tend to curve and could propagate in the direction orthogonal to the initial preferred fracture propagation direction (i.e., perpendicular to the initial minimum principal stress direction). Field data shows that infill well fractures can propagate towards producer wells and already depleted zones, which may lead to communication between infill and producer wells, negatively impacting production. In this paper, we present a three-dimensional fully-coupled analysis of production induced stress variations in in-situ stress and their possible reorientation around hydraulic fractures in horizontal wells. We also study the impact of this stress variation on propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures from infill wells. Using a single simulator (GeoFrac3D) creation of and production from multiple fractures is first simulated and then, multiple fracturing of infill wells is introduced taking into account the altered pore pressure and stress conditions. The results demonstrate the roles of stress and pore pressure, and reservoir poroelastic properties on the timing of infill well stimulation and production in the normal faulting stress regime. In contrast to earlier efforts that have mainly depended on the two separate numerical models (i.e., one for the production induced changes and another for the hydraulic fracture creation), in this study, a single numerical model can simulate both stages. |Introduction  |In the low permeability reservoirs, un-depleted zones among horizontal wells are developed after certain period of production, which requires refracturing of these zones to enhance the hydrocarbon recovery. The potential benefits of refracturing have been realized in oil and gas industry for more than 60 years.

To accurately design a drawdown plan requires knowledge of how stresses will evolve in the subsurface. Calculating dynamic stress changes during reservoir depletion, however, typically requires coupled-geomechanics simulators which are very specialized and time-consuming tools. In this work, we develop a methodology using analytical models to quickly estimate reservoir stress changes and predict effective stress on the fracture network in real-time. |In tight reservoirs, the drawdown management procedure has a direct link to flowing bottomhole pressure and the resulting stress on the proppant pack. To estimate the effective stress on the hydraulic fractures over time, a series of coupled-geomechanical models were built using realistic formation properties. These geomechanical modeling results were then used to calibrate an analytical model based on poroelastic theory. The analytical model is able to accurately reproduce the coupled-geomechanical results across a wide range of depletion scenarios with a small margin of error. Once calibrated, the analytical model can be used to quickly estimate the stress on the fracture network during routine well surveillance. |A case study will be shown demonstrating how the workflow led to field decisions in a high pressure unconventional reservoir in North America. After careful analysis of lab-measured fracture conductivity, the decision was made to decrease the production rate in order to keep the stress on the fracture network below a threshold value where reduced fracture conductivity was observed. The well with this managed drawdown schedule has maintained well productivity and has not flowed damaged proppant fines to surface in contrast to observations from other wells in the field. This workflow has improved the asset team’s ability to predict, identify, and mitigate fracture damage on unconventional horizontal wells, thereby avoiding the loss of estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) and enhancing project economics.|",""

The wells were completed using a technique that we refer to as Short Interval Re-injection (SIR). For each individual treatment stage, this technique makes use of an initial injection interval using conventional hydraulic fracturing pumping procedures, followed by a “soaking"" period that may last from a few hours to about one day in duration, during which the well is temporary shut in. This is followed by a subsequent re-injection interval with a pumping schedule similar to the first interval. Several commercial names are in use to describe this type of approach, which has a desired goal of enhancing the overall effectiveness of the treatment. In this study, we observe a significant increase in the rate of microseismic activity that occurs after the initial soaking period. This type of response has been documented previously and, in some cases, has been empirically related to increased production for wells. We postulate that cohesion of pre-existing fractures is reduced by the initial injection and soaking period, facilitating reactivation of fractures during the second injection. A numerical model has been developed using the software 3DEC in which the cohesion parameter for a discrete fracture network (DFN) is set to zero after the first injection stage.

The first two wells are at substantially different depths but each is within a thrust-fault stress setting (minimum stress = vertical stress). The third well is in a strike/slip stress environment, and the fourth is in a normal stress environment. |Traditional DFIT interpretation relies on the G-Function plot. This plot frequently indicates Height Recession/Transverse Storage (HR/TS), which has a concave-upward trend, or “belly”, on the G-dP/dG curve. Alternatively, some highly complex behavior can be seen prior to the onset of Nolte flow. The Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA) based Bourdet/Primary Pressure Derivative (PPD) log-log plot sometimes shows what would be considered a pre-closure radial flow regime. For a shallow thrust fault setting this can be an indicator of horizontal plane tensile fractures and a second higher closure stress. For the other stress regimes, radial flow can result from horizontal bedding plane slip at pressures below the overburden stress gradient. This requires that the coefficient of friction at the interface, fracture pressures, and in-situ stress are within a certain range. A simple mathematical model based upon the PKN hydraulic fracture geometry is developed to show how bedding-plane slip can occur even in a normal stress setting. |Further mathematical modeling is then developed to show the extent to which bedding-plane shear fractures can occur in comparison to the vertical fracture component. This has implications for DFIT analysis and full-scale hydraulic fracture treatment design. Lastly, concepts are proposed for possible modifications to the design of hydraulic fractures where bedding-plane fractures may occur.|","Document Type

While well-to-well interference induced by hydraulic fracturing is a very common type of event in this play, such interference is sometimes overlooked as it often results in production gains for the well impacted by the fluids injected during an offset well stimulation treatment. The objective of this study is to maximize the use of the production data available from the well-to-well interference incidents (a simple, low-cost surveillance strategy) to characterize, quantify, grade, and to understand the causes and consequences of hydraulic fracture well-to-well interference in order to continue to optimize the development of the field in terms of its economic value. |In this paper we first introduce the different types of well-to-well interference as background before the focus shifts into the hydraulic fracture well-to-well interference. The methodology begins with characterizing, quantifying, and ranking 65 historical frac-hit events that were documented in the Haynesville shale. Following this effort, we describe the findings as to what causes a frac-hit event and what drives the magnitude and extent of the production interference. The analysis of field data lead us to the relatively simple observation that a pressure sink (i.e., an area of depleted pressure) is not only the main cause, but it is also a necessary condition for a significant frac-hit to occur. Data suggests the degree of well communication highly correlates to the magnitude of the pressure sink and the distance between the producer and the infill well. |Regarding the well performance implications for the ""parent"" wells in the Haynesville shale, some wells do experience severe wellbore damage from a given frac-hit (or sequence of frac-hits). Although cases of severe damage are not the focus of this paper, we include insight about such cases and we direct the reader to other sources of information. An obvious comment would be that frac-hits which cause damage are considered to be negative. However, for the majority of the cases reviewed in this paper, the parent wells affected by frac-hits are able to continue to produce — and the post-frac-hit impact varies from neutral to positive both in terms of short-term production gains and long-term recovery.|","Document Type

Thus, while useful for understanding feet-scale changes in stratal packages, geological and petrophysical interpretations based on well log data sets should be supplemented with additional rock data from drill core that are collected at facies- and subfacies-scale resolution. These rock data, generated with geochemical and geomechanical tools, provide a more meaningful understanding of inter- and intrafacies variability, formation heterogeneity, and the stacking pattern and frequency of geomechanically-distinct rock units. A characterization of uppermost Wolfcamp and Bone Spring lithofacies and related chemofacies and their relationship to the stratigraphic record of rock strength is evaluated for three drill cores from Ward and Reeves counties, West Texas. |Stratigraphic records of inorganic geochemistry were collected from the slabbed face of three drill cores at a 2-inch sampling interval using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry. In addition, powdered rock samples were taken from the back of the core and analyzed for bulk mineralogy content using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Sample powders were subsequently pelletized and analyzed for major and trace element composition using XRF, and element-mineral linkages were established and extended to the full inorganic geochemical data set, creating a unique type of mineral model. The inorganic geochemistry data set was subsequently used to develop a record of chemofacies relationships. Estimates of rock strength were generated at the facies scale for the three cores using a micro-rebound hammer and compared with matching 1) elemental results, and 2) chemofacies assignments, in order to develop linkages between geochemistry, lithology, and rock strength. Important findings, including limitations of the workflow, will be discussed. |Introduction |Early Permian-aged strata deposited in distal environments of the Delaware Basin (Reeves and Ward counties), West Texas, record variations in fine-grained siliciclastic- and carbonate-dominated accumulation (Montgomery, 1997, 1997b). The fine-grained basinal strata have been litho-genetically linked with coarser-grained strata from the paleoshelf-slope system, especially to the (modern) North, along the Northwest Shelf (Gawlowski, 1987; Saller et al., 1989), but also to the West (Kerans and Nance, 1991; Kerans and Kempter, 2002; Ruppel and Ward, 2013). Recent work has focused on detailed lithofacies, mineralogical and chemostratigraphic subdivision of the basinal succession as a basis for refining perspectives on depositional conditions and the overarching glacio-eustatic and/or tectonic controls on accumulation (e.g., Nance and Rowe, 2015).|",""

Well logs are capable of measuring parameters that in some cases can be transformed to static moduli for inputs into frac design and to infer mechanical heterogeneity and stratigraphy (at log resolution). Due to the high cost, plug availability, and the presence of natural fractures, it is not possible to conduct triaxal tests over 100’s of feet of core to adequately measure mechanical heterogeneity and stratigraphy. Here, we present results of Index methods of strength and modulus measurement over 100’s of feet of core. We have chosen to use two commercially-available options, the Impulse Hammer and the Leeb Rebound Hardness tester. |The Impulse Hammer drops a small hemispherical mass into the core. From a combination of Hertzian contacts and impulse, the Plain Strain modulus, E*= E/(1- <U+03BD>2), can be determined from the force-time curve during the impact. Rebound Hardness is measured from the Leeb method in which a small ball is shot into the core and the ratio of the rebound velocity to impact velocity is measured, giving a hardness. It is possible to empirically transform this hardness to Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) or confined strength in some cases. Each individual measurement represents relatively-quick deformation of a small volume (~10 mm3) of material; leaving a small pit in the sample on the order of 10’s of microns. Measurement is considered a quasi-static measurement and the strain magnitudes are similar to those obtained when loading a plug sample in a conventional rock mechanics test. |Measurements are taken every cm, to assess fine-scale heterogeneity in unconventional reservoirs, along core lengths of many meters. This technique therefore spans small-scale up to large-scale and provides values that can be compared to more macroscopic measurement of heterogeneity and stratigraphy from well logs and into upscaling methods.|",""

This causes asymmetric growth of fractures from infill “child” wells more toward legacy “parent” wells. The asymmetric growth ends in fracture interference and subsequently results in an ineffective stimulation of the reservoir. To avoid the interference, operators have been exercising pressurization of the depleted region by means of shut-in parent wells while fracturing infill wells or by refracturing the parent well before fracturing of infill wells; a practice commonly known as “protection refrac”. The objective in this work is to study the effectiveness of protection refracs in re-pressurizing depleted reservoirs for the purpose of mitigating asymmetric fracture growth. |A transient poroelastic displacement discontinuity model is developed to study the problem of undesirable hydraulic fracture propagation toward depleted zones nearby an example parent well. The model is able to solve for pore pressure distribution and changes in principal stresses direction and magnitude around both parent and child wells. Pore pressure calculation due to production and so depletion of parent wells, and the resultant change in stress magnitudes are critical to understand and predict the extent of fractures from new infill wells. The model is capable of handling dynamic changes over time and can predict the optimum refracturing timing and volume. |Pore pressure and stress changes while production are calculated, and an estimated timing for protection refrac is suggested. Different refrac scenarios are examined throughout the life of the well and optimum refracturing volume and well spacing for infill wells are recommended. It is shown that there is a critical time in the life of the well that protection refrac could help pressurizing the formation directly by increasing pore pressure through fluid injection and indirectly by mechanical dilation of existing fractures. Beyond this critical time, any attempt in increasing pore pressure effectively may not be practically feasible due to the nature of the severe depletion. |The paper presents a novel approach in calculating stress changes and dynamic fracture propagation into depleted region over time. Asymmetric fracture growth is uniquely shown in depleted formations along with mitigation strategies to overcome this undesirable scenario.|",""

Standard laboratory protocols for measuring rock strength, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio commonly do not account for moisture content in the rocks, yet these parameters are critical in fracture designs. |The process of water weakening is particularly complicated in shales due to the combination of Total Organic Carbon (TOC), swelling clays and reactive minerals like silica and calcite. A study was carried out to determine the effects of spontaneous fluid imbibition (brine and dodecane) on Young’s modulus and hardness in shale. The measurements were made using a nanoindenter on shale samples from the Marcellus and the Woodford plays. |A key objective is to compare weakening effects of brine versus dodecane. It was found that irrespective of the shale wettability, brine led to a greater reduction in Young’s modulus (45% reduction in Marcellus, and 25% in Woodford) than dodecane (25% reduction in Marcellus, and 17% in Woodford). Clay stabilizing solutions like KCl brine had limited success in reducing the water weakening effect. Lastly, Marcellus shale samples experienced a greater reduction in Young’s modulus compared to Woodford shale samples possibly due to its larger pore throats, greater porosity, higher calcite content and strongly water wet character. |Introduction  |Water weakening effects have been studied on different rock types, namely sandstones, siltstones, andesite, granite and shales. The majority of the authors study the effects of spontaneous imbibition or partial saturation. Colback and Wiid (1965) were among the first to quantify the effects of moisture content on the reduction of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) in quarzitic sandstones. They observed up to 50% reduction in UCS. Spencer (1981) studied the effects of polar and non-polar fluids on Young’s modulus reduction in quartzose sandstone. He found that fluids like ethanol and n-decane also had a weakening effect, though it was not as severe as with water. He found that water caused the greatest weakening (50 % reduction) followed by ethanol (30 % reduction) and n-decane (10 % reduction). Clark et al. (1980) also showed that the attenuation increase and velocity reduction due to water saturation was much more than due to benzene saturation. They inferred that non-polar solvents like benzene had a much lower weakening effect.|",""

Shear reactivation of preexisting veins occurred in 3 of the Woodford shale samples. The behavior of these veins was compared to the Byerlee's friction law at low normal stress (<200 MPa). We tested the remaining 5 samples using a multistage triaxial test (Pagoulatos, 2004), defining load termination criterion based on the net volumetric strain, i.e. the onset of dilatancy, to preserve the integrity of the samples at each confining stress. Each multistage experiments allowed us to determine a linear failure envelope for the intact matrix of the rock using a single sample. |Introduction  |The compressive strength of rocks depends on confining pressure; however, the vast majority of compressive strength measurements reported in the literature come from unconfined tests. Coulomb’s (1776) friction hypothesis establishes that the shear stress, <U+03C4>s, and the normal stress, <U+03C3>n, at failure are linearly related. Thus, given a series of <U+03C4>s and <U+03C3>n values, one might fit a linear envelope to describe the stress state at failure, Eq. (1). The slope <U+03BC> of the linear envelope is the ‘friction coefficient’ and the intercept C is the ‘cohesion’: |<U+03C4>s = <U+03BC><U+03C3>n + C                                                           (1) |The conventional approach for defining a linear failure envelope requires multiple destructive triaxial tests and as many samples (see standard method ASTM D7012–14). This approach is impractical when only one sample is available or if sample heterogeneity is an issue—unless a value for either <U+03BC> or C is assumed. The multistage triaxial testing method introduced by Pagoulatos (2004) eliminates both limitations. Previous work indicates that there is a static offset for the failure envelope between the results from the conventional triaxial test and those from this multistage testing method. Thus, a simple rescaling recovers the equivalent multi–sample failure envelope.|",""

In this study, the results of an experimental investigation through simultaneous measurements of the mechanical properties, complex resistivity, and permeability in seal and reservoir shales and stone cores under uniaxial and triaxial stress states have been presented. The complex resistivity for the sandstone samples subjected to uniaxial loading indicated a reduction with increasing axial strain. The compressional wave velocity for the shale cores have been shown to be sensitive to the pore fluid compressibility while the resistivity of is the same core samples was observed to be sensitive to the pore fluid salinity changes and the stress changes. A strong correlation between the permeability and resistivity was obtained. |Introduction |Development of reliable geomechanical models for reservoir rocks is of great interest to wellpath optimization, secure drilling, well completions, and efficient production from unconventional as well as conventional reservoirs. The mechanical properties of tight oil and shale gas formations need to be coupled with the native pore fluids as well as the fluids introduced during the drilling, hydraulic fracturing and Enhanced Oil Recovery operations to accurately model the formation behavior during the lifecycle of these reservoirs. Fluid transportation in tight rock structure characterized by high heterogeneity and anisotropy along with nano-scale pore throats. The pore space and matrix contains various clay minerals and organic components that are complicated with capillary condensation, rock-fluid interactions, and exclusion of solute molecules in solution as shale formations will act as a semi permeable membrane limiting the entry of the solute particles passing through while fluid component can move in and out. Stress changes during drilling, completion, and production can exercise a great impact on the mechanical properties and the permeability due to the alterations these operations will cause in the microstructure. Access to comprehensive laboratory data set for developing geomechanical model for shale formations is limited, because shale measurements at in situ conditions are quite costly and highly challenging.|",""

The occurrence of this clay swelling on the surfaces of hydraulic fractures (HFs) highly depends on the fracture network complexities which can be predicted using a geomechanical model. Clay-swelling-induced conductivity damage is primarily a function of rock mineralogy, fracturing fluid composition, formation brine salinity, and fracturing fluid access to a realistic complex fracture network. In this work, we introduce a mechanistic approach to model clay swelling and water imbibition in various rock mineralogies including the Barnett (clay-rich), Eagle Ford (calcite-rich), and Marcellus Shales. Clay swelling counteractively influences production through favorable water-gas replacement and undesirable permeability reduction. We used a coupled multi-phase reactive-transport simulator to comprehensively model this process. Here, the main clay swelling mechanisms are denoted as the ion hydration and the expansion of the electrostatic double layer. We used the calculated volume expansion of clay materials exposed on the fracture surface to modify the fracture and matrix permeabilities. We acquired a complex fracture network mechanistically using a well-established poro-elastic cohesive zone model integrated with a wellbore model and an implicit intersection model. Subsequently, we developed an embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) in order to evaluate the production performance of this complex HF network after clay swelling damage and water imbibition. |The simulation results indicate that the degree of clay swelling varies in different shale formations. On the basis of the clay content and the mineralogies considered in this work, we observed a significant expansion in electrostatic double layer for the Barnett Shale following the fracturing fluid injection. Nevertheless, this effect was lower in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus Shales. The presented approach provides the capability to mechanistically model the clay stability and water imbibition to approximate their impact on the production performance.|",""

In the vertical well, mineralogy from DRIFTS analysis of the 233 cuttings samples compares well with the mineralogy provided by high-definition spectroscopy logging and the cuttings can be easily assigned an accurate vertical depth. DRIFTS captures the major changes in lithology with depth and shows alternating units of carbonate and siliciclastic-rich sediments that are characteristic of the Bone Spring formation. In the carbonate-rich intervals the clay concentration, predominantly illite, averages 8 wt%. Calcite is the dominant carbonate mineral (average 56 wt%) but with notable amounts of dolomite (average 10 wt%), possibly occurring as cement. Quartz-plus-feldspar averages 24 wt%. In the siliciclastic-rich layers total clay averages 15 wt%, quartz-plus-feldspar averages 53 wt%, and total carbonate averages 26 wt %. Organic matter (kerogen) content is higher in the siliciclastic-rich layers (average 4 wt%) than in the carbonate-rich layers (average 1-2 wt%). The highest concentration of organic matter, up to 10 wt%, occurs in the interval corresponding to the lower portion of the Avalon shale. |Three hundred and fifteen cuttings from an associated horizontal well were also analyzed by DRIFTS and show that mineralogy in the siliciclastic-rich target interval remains relatively homogenous throughout the extent of the lateral, with the exception of two intervals related to geo-steering where the drillstring exited the target and entered an adjacent carbonate-rich interval. Quartz-plus-feldspar is dominant in the siliciclastic-rich interval with an average concentration of 66 wt%. Total clay averages 16 wt% with illite as the dominant clay mineral. Based on the clay speciation, the threat of swelling clays detrimentally affecting production is unlikely. The organic matter concentration along the lateral averages 2 wt%. Organic thermal maturity estimated by DRIFTS is near 1 %Ro, which suggests that the maturity is in the oil window and is supported by Rock-Eval 6 pyrolysis measurements on a limited number of samples that yield thermal maturity from Tmax of ~0.8 %Ro. The DRIFTS analysis obtains a skeletal density for the kerogen of ~1.24 g/cm3 and a calculated, average matrix density of the siliciclastic-rich interval of 2.62 g/cm3.

Although multi-stage hydraulic fracturing technologies have been used successfully to tap unconventional reservoirs like Bakken, challenges still remain in terms of effects of mechanical properties of organic materials and kerogen within shale on fracture initiation, fracture propagation, and optimal fracture design. In recent years, nanoindentation technology has been applied in the studies for some shale gas and oil plays. In this paper, we present a new workflow that integrates nanoindentation testing and laboratory characterizations of organic-rich shale samples via x-ray diffractions, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectroscopy, etc. To qualitatively characterize organic-rich shales in fine scale, anisotropy of the shale sample was taken into account so that core samples with testing surfaces parallel to and perpendicular to the bedding planes were selected to perform nanoindentation. Nanoindentation testing was conducted to examine shale mechanical properties. A closer examination of the flaky sheets by SEM shows a complex matrix of solid minerals held together with a dark-phase material in Bakken samples. This work is especially useful for the optimization of the drilling activities, as well as the hydraulic fracturing operations in Bakken fields. |Introduction |The Bakken formation has become in last few years as one of the most important energy sources in the United States. The region of the Bakken formation mainly includes North Dakota, Montana, Saskatchewan and Manitoba (Figure 1). The application of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has been widely used in Bakken formation since 2000 and in the year of 2014, North Dakota became the second-largest oil production state in the United States. |The Bakken formation is confined by the carbonates, shales, and sands of the Lodgepole(upper) and Three Forks(lower) formations (Cramer, 1991).

Nanoindentation testing on drill cuttings and sidewall cores can be used to obtain reliable measurement of Young’s modulus which is an important parameter used in hydraulic fracturing design (Shukla et al., 2013). During the experiments using nanoindentation technology, Young’s modulus and hardness of the rock samples can be obtained to be a reference for drilling.

At the heart of such efforts is the optimization of the completions strategy employed. Typically, innovation in completions optimization leans heavily on process or equipment / operational improvement. Yet understanding the fabric of the rock is equally important in achieving gains in efficiency and asset performance. Core analysis, or, more precisely, fine-scale reservoir characterization derived from high-resolution core data and well-logs, is a valuable tool for improving completions, but is not utilized to the extent it should. The real question is to determine the impact the integration of such properties has in creating better fracturing and production models. This paper evaluates the benefits of constructing high-resolution continuous logs from core analysis by performing various completion modeling sensitivities utilizing log based and core based models in the Bone Spring formation, Delaware Basin, Reeves County, TX. |For this study, we start with high resolution core measurements at the inch X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and foot XRay Diffraction (XRD) scales. Vertical and horizontal rock mechanics measurements for triaxial mechanical properties to simulate hydraulic fracture geometries specific to this play were also taken. Property-based relationships within various formation facies of Bone Spring, Reeves County were developed using conventional cores and sonic logs to enhance the standard 2-foot sonic resolution to an inch scale. |The resulting high resolution profiles are ideal for addressing thin bed layering effects and to capture efficiently the under estimation or over estimation of lithological properties performed by the standard logs due to resolution constraints. These small (inch) scale features, can have substantive impact on fracture and production modeling, and are either not normally captured by conventional logging tools that have a resolution scale greater than the thickness of the thin beds, or are ignored because of the difficulty in identification/characterization due to data (core/high tier logs) limitations. In an effort to identify these thin beds and evaluate their impact, a suite of testing was developed to capture small-scale changes between Geochemistry and rock properties throughout a depth of interest. From this body of data, relationships between elemental composition and mineralogy were derived and compared to mechanical properties from triaxial experiments. High-resolution continuous profiles for density, compressional and shear velocities were derived which clearly illustrate variability between log based and core based models.

An important factor in shales is the fluid-to-rock interaction. The smaller the pore size the higher the ratio of pore surface area to fluid volume. Small pore sizes cause a suppressed bubble point, a higher overall oil saturation when oil and gas phases coexist, and an extended constant gas-oil ratio during production. |We model these effects by coupling the Young-Laplace equation and an interfacial tension model into compositional fluid simulation. This effectively accounts for the fluid-to-rock interaction existent in shale reservoirs. Capillary pressure makes a significant impact on both fluid properties and production forecasting. These effects have been studied by several authors. |However, reservoir simulation is very sensitive to relative permeability. Oil and gas relative permeability curves are very difficult to determine for shale reservoirs because of the very low permeability and time required for measurement. One approach to this issue is the use of predictive modeling from first principle models, which is particularly valuable when data are limited. |We use the Young-Laplace equation to generate capillary pressure curves for two cases: (1) where both phases are depleted from a collection of pores, so that overall composition remains constant, and (2) where only the gas phase is depleted from a collection of pores. We determine these curves for both a single pore size and for a distribution of pores. This generates an oil-gas capillary pressure curve for the entire pore system. |With the resulting capillary pressure curve, we use the method derived by Nakornthap and Evans (1986) to integrate and yield relative permeability curves for the given fluid and pore size distribution. Minimal published data exist to validate the results. However, some simulations have been performed to obtain relative permeability curves for shale reservoirs and our results show a good match. |When the constant composition and gas depletion relative permeability curves are plotted against normalized oil saturation, the curves match very closely. This means the relative permeability curves can effectively be scaled once a residual oil saturation is known.|",""

These mudstones are punctuated by a variable proportion of heterogeneities such as parallel bedded fractures filled with fibrous calcite (the “beef”), calcitic nodules and ash beds. Understanding the genesis of these beef is important because they may represent up to 4% of the facies. These beef will also likely affect the propagation and efficiency of hydraulic fracturing during stimulation. |Several hundred meters of cores from different wells of various maturities were studied at very high resolution, including 1 cm spacing Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurement by the LIPS (Laser Induced Pyrolysis System) along with detailed sedimentological core descriptions. |At least two main types of beef are observed on cores. The first type is laterally continuous, at the core scale, displaying or not a median line with fibrous calcite growth. The second type, called micro-beef, is thinner (a few mm), discontinuous and in relay, lenticular or sigmoidal. Regarding the continuous beef, no link was evidenced with the surrounding depositional facies of the source rock neither with the mineralogical content (such as calcite). More surprisingly, no clear correlation was found between beef occurrence and TOC values although beef are only found in source rocks. The cumulated thickness of beef increases with maturity and a large proportion of beef develops along or close to heterogeneities such as ash beds (for the most part) or calcitic nodules. This proportion is decreasing with maturity and a phasing in beef formation is evidenced. The clayey ash beds are among the most porous facies (13% porosity in average). Similarly the calcitic nodules were initially also porous facies. The hypothesis which is made is that, first, fluids preferentially circulate and concentrate within these thin high porosity streaks and, due to overpressure created inside these tiny reservoir beds, natural hydraulic fractures are created at their interfaces and subsequently filled by calcite that starts crystallizing from the bed interfaces. In the latter case, a median line, i.e. crystallization up and down from the fracture, is not systematically observed. With increasing maturity and increasing hydrocarbon and aqueous calcitic fluids expulsion and migration, overpressure is generated in the shale matrix near the ash beds and more beef can be formed. Those latter beef develop a median line. With maturity further increasing, beef are generated everywhere else in the series where TOC reaches at least 2%.|",""

In some cases, an abundance of events cluster along the bedding planes, which can suggest they are occurring along the layer surfaces of the formation. However, it is necessary to carefully examine whether this is actually occurring or if it is a result of a stacking artifact caused by a high-velocity contrast between the layers. Datasets recorded using straddling single or multiple arrays provide high locational accuracy of the events and therefore can be used to confirm bedding slippage. In addition, datasets recorded with a hybrid array consisting of both microseismic geophones and microdeformation tiltmeters can be used to identify the hydraulic area of created fractures and to eliminate events that are stress related, or so-called “dry” events. Certain microseismic event properties plotted vs. depth can suggest whether bedding slip has occurred. Microseismic events can also be used to verify layering in the formation of interest. |Introduction  |The ability to predict bedding slip as a part of total rock deformation occurring during the fracturing process is important for reservoir characterization as well as potential prediction of induced seismicity. Geomechanical modeling can simulate geological structure development during hydraulic fracture stimulation. In particular, finite element modeling allows complex geometries to be combined with realistic material models, thus leading to mechanically rigorous forward models. In addition, laboratory studies of fracture propagations suggest the occurrence of interface slippage under certain stress conditions (van Eekelen 1982). However, the question remains whether bedding slip can be confirmed using microseismic data. Various research suggests that microseismic events can represent shearing on bedding planes, with the horizontal nodal plane corresponding to the slip surface (Rutledge et al. 2013; Stanek and Eisner 2013). Datasets recorded on a multi-array system can be used for moment tensor inversion to determine the difference between events that occurred within a formation layer vs. events caused by bedding slip (Rutledge et al. 2015).|",""

The deformation and fracture properties largely depend on the rock mechanical properties. Due to the mineralogical variability, mechanically and chemically unstable properties of the shale formations, it is very expensive and sometimes even impossible to obtain suitable size samples for standard mechanical testing. Nanoindentation, which only requires a small sample volume, is a promising technique to detect the in situ mechanical properties. In this paper, we picked samples from Bakken Formation, a typical unconventional reservoir in North America. By using FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope), we characterized the pore structures in nanoscale. Then we analyzed the mineral compositions of the samples by element mapping using EDX. After that, we applied grid nanoindentation to calculate Young’s modulus and hardness value of the samples and compared. The results showed that the mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus and hardness values of the sample which is parallel to the bedding line are different from the value of the sample which is perpendicular to the bedding line, identifying the anisotropy properties. Samples from Middle Bakken Formation have larger Young’s modulus and hardness values than the values of Upper Bakken Formation. |Introduction |Due to the depletion of the conventional resources and the increasing demand of the energy by the society, unconventional resources such as shale reservoirs has been widely carried out by many countries. The development in the fracturing technology and the horizontal drilling increases the total production of the oil and gas (Li, et al., 2015). Mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus can influence the stability of the fractures, which will affect the performance of the hydraulic fracturing. The deep understanding of the mechanical properties can assist the hydraulic fracturing operations and finally increase profits. Shales are multi-phase, multi-scale heterogeneous sedimentary rocks, which comprise a variable mineralogy, nanoscale pores and clay particles (Bobko and Ulm, 2008; Veytskin et al., 2017). Due to the mineralogical variability, mechanically and chemically unstable properties of the shale formations, sometimes it is difficult to apply the standard mechanical testing methods to derive the mechanical properties of the shale rocks.|",""

However, the literature lacks experimental database of simultaneously and continuously measuring carbon dioxide permeability and storage capacity in shales under a wide range of pressures. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by investigating and comparing carbon dioxide transport mechanisms in shales under low pressure and high pressure conditions. Forty pressure pulse transmission tests were performed with carbon dioxide and other two types of gas (helium and nitrogen) for comparison. Tests were conducted under constant effective stress (2,000 psi) with multistage increased pore pressures (0~2,000 psi). Gas (carbon dioxide and nitrogen) adsorption capacity was measured using the difference between the total gas volume and the free gas volume, in terms of both Gibbs and absolute adsorption. Afterward, gas apparent permeability including diffusion/slip-flow/Darcy-flow/adsorption was calculated, and an analytical solution for adsorption free permeability determination was used to evaluate adsorption contribution to flow capacity. The experimental observations indicate that CO2 petrophysical properties differ significantly from other types of gas in shale reservoirs. Its adsorption and apparent permeability all decline markedly across the phase change region, leading to the ultra-low permeability in the high-pressure region. |Introduction  |CO2 injection has been suggested as a feasible method for IOR in tight oil or shale oil reservoirs by conventional flooding or huff-n-puff process (Ren et al. 2010; Willhite et al. 2012; Afonja et al. 2012; Jin et al. 2016a; Jin et al. 2016b; Hawthorne et al. 2017; Jia et al. 2017a). Also, CO2 has stronger adsorption capacity than CH4 in shale reservoirs, making it promising to recover CH4 through competitive adsorption in shale gas reservoirs (Clarkson and Haghshenas 2013; Aljamaan 2013). On the other hand, injecting CO2 into shales reduces greenhouse emissions and may help alleviate climate change (IEA, 2016). Therefore, a deep understanding of CO2 adsorption and flow behavior is critical for both field operation and accurate modelling of IOR and EGR processes.|",""

These reservoirs are complex, layered systems of mixed lithology and grain size, with various amounts of total organic carbon. The commonality is that these reservoirs are laminated, with low porosity and permeability. Rock properties can also vary laterally along the length of a horizontal wellbore or between wellbores. Industry has done a reasonable job of determining how to 'optimally develop' each reservoir in specific parts of a specific basin essentially by trial and error. Using these multi-million dollar wells to learn what works and what does not work represents an approach to technology development that is costly and has little or no predictive capability away from the geographically limited area where the technology approach is developed. |Even though the industry has done a reasonable job of 'optimizing' in a single formation in a single location in many cases, every horizontal well is a research project. The industry needs models to help predict how to drill, complete and produce shale wells to optimize development in new formations and new geographic areas.  |We need predictive geologic models as input to decide where to drill wells, how long the horizontal wells should be drilled, and where to land the laterals. The geologic models should be used as input into both the hydraulic fracturing and the reservoir simulation models. |Once the geologic predictive models have been used to generate a detailed 3D geologic data set, then the hydraulic fracturing modelers need to use the information to determine how the hydraulic fractures will propagate from the horizontal wellbore and how natural fractures might contribute to flow. The industry still has a long way to go before rigorous models are developed to simulate fracture propagation from multiple injection clusters in thick, layered reservoirs. |The ultimate goal is to develop reservoir models that can take the input from the geologic models, the hydraulic fracture propagation models, and additional data such as PVT properties, pressure data, well test data, and production data to match both the reservoir behavior and be capable of predicting production from the reservoir as functions of well bore landing zone, well bore length, and hydraulic fracture properties. Such matches and predictions can only come if we can model the reservoir around the well bore in detail and then learn how to translate that into practical models that can be used to simulate the entire reservoir.|",""

Data from wells that experienced ‘frac-hits’ suggest that substantial amount of fracturing fluids from offset wells may invade the existing producers, indicating high degree of connectivity between the existing producer and the newly stimulated well. Even if the parent well is shutin during the fracturing of the child well, oil rates after re-starting the parent well production were observed to be lower than that prior to shut-in, and the oil production trend line deviates (usually lower) from the original type curve prediction. |We used a mechanistic model to assess the impact of ‘frac-hits’ on oil production. The results indicate that the impact of ‘frac-hits’ on oil production can be significantly different depending on producing pressure of the impacted wells. ‘Frac-hits’ below the bubble point pressures could have long-lasting adverse effects on oil production. Among the mechanisms studied, gas trapping is found to be the most likely mechanism that impacts oil production. Gas trapping occurs when fracturing fluids suddenly invade the depleted matrix due to the relatively large gas compressibility. The snapped-off gas, isolated from the continuous fluid path in the matrix near the fractures, can hinder the oil productivity. |If gas trapping cannot be remediated after ‘frac-hits’, oil EUR may be decreased along with increased water handling. Given this, oil production may be optimized by coordinating the fracturing sequence and spacing to avoid ‘frac-hits’ below the bubble point and avoid re-fracturing in the region below the bubble point. |Introduction |Over the past decade, technological advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have allowed the access to large volumes of shale oil that were previously uneconomic. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated approximately 419 billion barrels of recoverable shale oil resources in 46 countries (EIA 2016). The United States (US) contributes more than 90 percent of the global shale oil production in 2016. Current production in the US relies heavily on drilling and fracturing large numbers of wells, which is capital intensive.|",""

The methods available for interpretation of pressure tests are reviewed and modified with emphasis on difference between the intrinsic and apparent permeability. Improved formulations and analysis methods which honor the relevant physics of fluid and transport, and interactions with shale are presented. Better design and analysis of experiments for simultaneous determination of several unknown parameters that impact the transport calculations, including deformation, adsorption, diffusion, and deviation from Darcy flow are described. The permeability and other parameters of shale samples are recommended to be determined by simultaneous analysis of multiple pressure tests conducted under different conditions to accommodate for temporally and spatially variable conditions. The inherent limitations of the methods relying on the analytical solutions of the diffusivity equation based on the Darcy’s law are explained. |Introduction |The permeability measured using a Darcy-like equation is not the intrinsic permeability but the apparent permeability which depends on the prevailing conditions of fluid, transport, and shale. The intrinsic permeability of shale depends on the temperature and effective stress conditions and therefore the conditions of a particular intrinsic value should also be specified. The primary reason for the contradictory values of permeability measured by application of the analytical models is explained by dependence of measured permeability of shale on particular testing conditions over which only a certain average permeability value is obtained from most analytical solutions. |Crushed samples have different size particles. The permeability of a particle depends on its size. Large particles are likely to have both the matrix porosity and fracture porosity. Consequently, it is not correct to assume all the particles of different sizes to have the same permeability. Whereas, most attempts in calculating the permeability using the pressure tests on crushed samples assume the same permeability for all particles. This assumption can only be applicable for samples of uninform particle sizes.|",""

These sweet spots are increasingly scarce, and hence the number of infill wells that will be drilled will increase. Stimulation treatment of the infill wells (“child” wells) drilled next to existing producers (“parent” wells) often causes negative fracture interference (“frac hits”), frequently resulting in irreversible production degradation on both parent and child wells. |This paper focuses on the implementation and modeling of a novel far-field diversion technique to reduce the frequency and severity of frac hits by altering the hydraulic fracture behavior. This method relies on the deployment of fracture geometry control (FGC) diversion pills consisting of a predetermined mixture of multi-sized specialty solid materials designed to create a low permeability barrier at fracture tips (far-field diversion), which alters in-situ fracture propagation. |This paper describes a case history where this novel technology was used during the completion of two infill wells drilled next to a producing parent well in the Eagle Ford Shale. Both infill wells targeted the lower portion of the Eagle Ford but were landed in different pay intervals in order to maximize hydrocarbon drainage. FGC pill was included in the pumping schedule to induce far-field diversion and prevent the infill well fractures’ growth towards the depleted pressure area around the parent well. The effectiveness of diversion was assessed through a high frequency pressure monitoring (HFPM) technique, which relies on processing surface pressure signals at high frequency. Pressure sensors were installed at the wellhead connections of both infill wells and the interpretation of pressure signatures was used to evaluate the degree of hydraulic communication between the wellbores and to gain an understanding of diversion effectiveness of various pill designs. Analysis of the pressure data indicates that hydraulic communication between the adjacent wells was reduced when FGC material was pumped. |Post-job production analysis shows that production of the infill well landed in the same zone as parent well was improved by 12% if compared to the average production of similar offset infill wells in the area. Furthermore, parent well production also improved by 5%, further evidence that fracture hits were successfully mitigated and that the original conductive area did not sustain damage. These results were further confirmed by hydraulic fracture and reservoir modeling using advanced integrated modeling workflow. The model confirmed that production improvement is a direct result of enhanced reservoir stimulation coverage of the infill well when the FGC technique was used.|",""

We sampled microseismic data from two hydraulically fractured Marcellus wells in the Appalachian Basin, northern West Virginia, vertically through the event cloud, crossing shale, limestone, sandstone, and chert. We focused our analysis on the Devonian organic shale and created pseudo-logs of moment magnitude (Mw), b-value, and event count. The vertical moving-average sampling of microseismic data was completed such that the sample interval matched that of the geophysical well log. This technique creates robust, high-resolution microseismic logs that show subtle changes in microseismic properties and allows direct cross-plotting of microseismic versus geophysical logs. We chose five geomechanical properties to form the framework against which to interrogate the microseismic data: Young’s modulus (YM), Poisson’s ratio (PR), brittleness, lambda·rho (<U+03BB><U+03C1>), and mu·rho (µ<U+03C1>). Additionally, we included natural gamma as a useful measure of organic content. Having defined this microseismic-geomechanical cross-plot space, we derived insights into the response of these units during hydraulic fracturing. Observations include: 1) larger magnitude microseismicity occurs in high PR, high YM rocks; high event counts are found in low PR rocks; 2) low b-value (high in-situ stress) is consistent with the occurrence of larger magnitude events and low event counts; and 3) YM and PR act as bounding conditions, creating “sweet spots” for high and low Mw, event count, and stress. In our cross-plot space, there is a meaningful link between microseismicity and the elastic properties of the host rock. In light of this dependence of stimulation potential on elastic properties, the calculation of microseismic pseudo-logs at stimulation sites and application of our cross-plot framework for microseismic-geomechanical analysis in unconventional shale will inform operators in planning and forecasting stimulation and production, respectively.|","Document Type

The study incorporates fracture modeling, production history match, and pressure communication observation from offset wells in different areas of the play. The study is integrated with a detailed data analytics overview of nearly 400 wells in the same regions. Stimulation of wells is modeled with sensitivity to different fluid and proppant job sizes. The study results show that there can be justification for staggering of well layout in a particular acreage of Eagle Ford. However, in most of the operated areas fracture modeling predicts fracture growth vertically all through the height of lower Eagle Ford. Simulated fracture growth across the Lower Eagle Ford, along with well spacing previously chosen suggested the wells to be in communication with each other during production. A series of production interference tests, fracturing pressure records and production data analysis indicated that the wells were in communication with each other. Analysis suggested that well spacing can be optimized greatly to increase the overall NPV. Additional fracture modeling studies combined with numerical and analytical reservoir simulation showed that wider well spacing need to be implemented to avoid significant fracture overlap and aggressive production interference when larger stimulations are pumped in the wells. From data analytics also wider well spacing is suggested to enhance the production over the first six-month life of the well. A workflow is finally shown that gives a general overview of the process of finding the optimum well spacing in Eagle Ford Shale. |Introduction  |There are nearly 12,000 producing wells exist in Eagle Ford shale in south Texas.

To better identify the reliability of source mechanisms, we examine the limitations of microseismic field data imposed by (1) lack of angular coverage, (2) moment tensor inversion constraints, and (3) effects of mild anisotropy. We use synthetic seismograms to examine cases of either pure double-couple (DC) or compensated-linear-vector dipole (CLVD) sources. The open-source full-wavefield moment tensor inversion code (ISOLA) incorporates both near- and intermediate-field terms, which can increase the accuracy of the inversion if source-receiver distances are small. The tested locations and dominant source frequencies of the synthetic seismograms used for analysis resemble the expected locations and dominant frequencies of microseismic events extracted from a multi-stage field data set in the Barnett Shale of East Texas. We conclude that although a horizontal receiver array can provide greater angular coverage of vertical failure planes than a vertical receiver array, the strike of shear (DC) sources cannot be accurately resolved unless the receiver array has angular coverage to sample both sides of the shear failure plane. If the source is DC, the inversion can result in a CLVD mechanism that is overestimated by up to ~40% and if the source is CLVD, the DC mechanism can be overestimated by ~20%. Errors in the inversion results are interpreted to be because of the lack of receiver angular coverage of the source rather than possible errors associated with source mislocation. The use of the deviatoric assumption decreases the error in the resolved source mechanism by ~30-~40%, however, this increases the error in the resolved source strike to ~15°-~35°. For pure shear sources, 5% VTI anisotropy in the medium has minimal effect on source orientation (<15°) but can introduce 25-50 m of error in the source location. The neglect of anisotropy in moment tensor inversion has a greater effect (~40% variation) on the estimated source mechanism for pure CLVD sources than for pure DC sources.|",""

In this paper, we show that the hydrocarbons in the formation partition into fluids with significantly varying physical properties across the nanopore size distribution of shale. This partitioning is a consequence of multi-component hydrocarbon mixture stored in nanopores showing a significant compositional variation with the pore size. The smaller the pore is, the heavier and the more viscous the hydrocarbon mixture becomes. During the production and pressure depletion, primarily the lighter hydrocarbons of the mixture are released from the nanopores. Hence, the composition of the remaining hydrocarbons inside the pores becomes progressively heavier. The viscosity and apparent molecular weight of the hydrocarbon mixture left behind increase significantly during the depletion. The kinetic mean-free path length of the mixture does not increase, however, as anticipated from the kinetic theory of gases. Further, the length may decrease drastically in small nanopores as an indication of capillary condensation and trapping of the hydrocarbon mixture. These effects significantly limit the release of hydrocarbons from nanopores, in particular those pores with sizes smaller than 10nm. |In the light of these microscopic scale observations, the concept of composition redistribution of the produced fluids is introduced and a new volumetric method is presented honoring the compositional variability in nanopores for an improved accuracy in predicting hydrocarbons in-place in presence of adsorption and nano-confinement effects. The method allows us to differentiate mobile bulk hydrocarbon fluids from the fluids under confinement effects and from the trapped hydrocarbon fluid dissolved in the organic material. Hence, it also reduces the uncertainties in predicting the reserve. The application of the method is presented using produced hydrocarbon fluid composition for dry gas and wet-gas formations and using reservoir flow simulation of production from a multi-stage fractured single horizontal well. We showed that liquids production is mainly due to flow of bulk fluid in large-pore volume.|",""

The advisory system is a software platform, deployed in the driller’s cabin, which builds upon existing drill-off test workflows where drillers periodically make adjustments to Auto Driller set points to determine optimal controllable drilling parameters. The system augments these existing workflows with color map visualizations of drilling performance and provides recommendations for controllable drilling parameter set points. The goal of the system is to help the driller achieve high rates of penetration and reduced vibrations and also adapt to changing drilling conditions. |The drilling advisory system was introduced on one of the operator’s drilling rigs in the Permian Basin starting in 3Q 2016 to aid in intermediate hole section on-bottom drilling activities, and in particular real-time management of controllable drilling parameters. At the time of introduction of the system into the drilling program, drilling practices were mature in this field with over one hundred offsets drilled in the area by the operator. In this study we compare drilling performance for the intermediate hole section on the test rig (rig on which the advisory system was installed) to performance of the fleet at large and also to that of an offset rig, a sister rig of the test rig. |Comparison of performance between the test rig and sister rig was designed to minimize the influence of factors affecting drilling performance. On the test rig drillers used software system guided drill-off tests to choose set points for drilling parameters. On the second rig drillers managed drilling parameters based on experience from recent offset wells. Drilling hours per depth plots show that drilling proceeded faster when using the optimization system. Cost savings achieved by the test rig may be attributed to more optimal real-time drilling parameters selection through system usage and to indirect cost savings from BHA redesign and improved drilling practices. A multivariable statistical regression analysis is provided to breakdown various components of performance gains and confidence levels.|",""

However, it is very common, in the Permian Basin and other unconventional provinces that induced fractures are less satisfactory than expected; sometimes, they even fail, though the design might have been exactly the same as in a neighboring well. This situation is more challenging for small operators who do not have the technology and financial flexibility to perform expensive lab and field tests before the stimulation. |Existing lab technology uses large block samples to test fracability and breakdown pressure. Fracture conductivity test are usually carried out separately using pre-cut samples. These tests provide valuable parameters for hydraulic fracturing design. But there is a high uncertainty due to the separation between fracture creation and measurement of induced fracture conductivity. |The integrated testing procedure, introduced in this paper, is developed with the intention to overcome these limitations yet keep the measurements aligned with standard core tests. Similar to standard core tests, the rock sample is placed under simulated reservoir conditions of pressure and temperature. Depending on the in-situ stress combination, effective stresses on the core are altered in order to simulate the hydraulic fracturing process until a fracture is created. Permeability of the core, and of the induced fracture, is continuously measured. Breakdown pressure and other parameters are also recorded during the whole process. |Preliminary results indicated that: (1) Confining pressure is a dominant factor in controlling whether the rock fails in brittle or ductile mode; (2) If the rock fails in a brittle mode, permeability of the rock, and later the induced fracture, increases rapidly during and post fracturing process periods; (3) If the rock fails in a ductile mode, permeability decreases rapidly during and post fracturing process periods; (4) Transitional behaviors are observed when the rock fails between semi-brittle and semi-ductile under an intermediate confining pressure range which corresponds to the majority of real world reservoir conditions. (5) The proposed lab test provides an option to exclude ductile failure and to optimize brittle fracturing before hydraulic fracturing operation. This might be more valuable to the development of unconventional resources due to the complicated relationship among wellbore orientation, the perforation and in-situ stress fields.|",""

In this work, we quantify recovery factors for downspaced shale wells using a reservoir simulation approach supported by rate transient analysis (RTA) and geomechanical and petrophysical studies. |Our analyses is based on data from a PAD well in the Eagle Ford shale. First we identify different petrofacies in the area of study from well logs. These are then populated in a 3D reservoir simulation model with the corresponding rock type (RC) constrained porosity and water saturation. Permeability estimates are derived from an RTA-based workflow. The well is completed in the rich gas condensate window of the Eagle Ford and an equation of state (EOS) model is calibrated to available laboratory data. |To mimic the fracturing process we have implemented the modified Barton-Bandis model in flow simulation suggested by Tran et al.

Unfortunately, the use of fast drilling motors combined with delayed logging tools, and insufficient data to quantify mechanical properties while drilling creates multiple geosteering challenges. This paper presents three case studies illustrating the benefits of a new technology that uses surface drilling data to estimate, in real time, the geomechanical properties needed to guide the steering of horizontal wells into the most fracable rock. |The Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) computed from commonly available drilling data such as torque, rate of penetration and weight on bit has been widely used to improve drilling efficiency. However, the more recent use of MSE for completion optimization has yielded conflicting results. The three case studies use the Corrected Mechanical Specific Energy (CMSE) where the friction losses along the drill string and wellbore are computed and accounted for in real time. CMSE is used to estimate, in real time, geomechanical logs, pore pressure, stresses and a natural fracture index. Various data ranging from seismic, to wireline, to microseismicity are used to validate the drilling derived logs. All validation indicates that the surface drilling data provide actionable information to be used during drilling to steer the wells into the most fracable rock and after the drilling to optimize completion of the unconventional wells. |This technology represents a major step in completion optimization since it tackles the problem and provides the solution during the drilling phase. A major advantage of the new technology is its ability to be deployed on any rig without the use of additional surface gauges, sensors or downhole measurement tools, avoiding additional costs and potential risks of wellbore problems. Additional benefits of the technology include: no on-site personnel or permits, the use of existing real time drilling data streaming services to quickly steer in the most fracable rock, and having completion design immediately after drilling ends. This contrasts dramatically with alternative completion optimization methods for which data delivery, analysis, planning and design can take many days, if not weeks.|",""

This stratigraphic interval is now also under appraisal as an unconventional play with a vast resource potential. An unconventional screening workflow, assessing organic-carbon content, maturity, thickness, and depth, has identified a considerable area that appears to be viable as an exploration target. |To gain an understanding of the controls on sweet-spot distribution in this frontier unconventional play, it is necessary to consider a producing analogue. The Eagle Ford play in the Western Gulf, USA is commonly considered as a reservoir completion analogue because it has a comparable carbonate-dominated composition. However, the Eagle Ford play does not appear to be a pertinent exploration analogue because the geological criteria that control the distribution of sweet spots are fundamentally distinct from the Hanifa play. In this study, the emerging Vaca Muerta play in the Neuquen Basin, Argentina is considered to be a useful exploration analogue because its depositional architecture, stratigraphic variability, and composition are comparable to the Hanifa play. |Sweet spots in the Vaca Muerta play are controlled by mechanical stratigraphy, which is related to the architecture and stratigraphic variability within the depositional system. Interval-specific production data from the Vaca Muerta Formation demonstrates that the best-performing units are not necessarily the most organic-rich, but relate to units with high frequency, cyclical intercalation of organic-rich units, and more brittle carbonate-dominated target horizons. The integration of seismic, well log, geomechanical, and production data demonstrates that sweet spots occur within progradational packages on the carbonate ramp. The best-performing areas (e.g., northwest sector at Loma Campana Block) intersect the lowstand systems tract where forced regression of the carbonate ramp induces reworking and detrital carbonate input into the anoxic basin. |By upscaling these concepts, an unconventional exploration model can be formulated to guide regional sweet-spot prediction. The unconventional exploration model uses gross depositional environment maps, within the predictive framework of a sequence stratigraphic model, to identify the aerial extent of geomechanical sweet spots within each defined eustatic sequence. This is a valuable tool that can be used in conjunction with regional seismic data to identify potential sweet spots in both the Vaca Muerta play and the analogous Hanifa play.|",""

The multi-physics make it difficult to obtain a deep understanding of flow mechanisms and production process of shale gas reservoirs. Ignoring any physics might lead to misleading prediction or misunderstanding of shale gas production behaviors. In this work, a set of realistic experimental data of the Marcellus shale and the Eagle Ford shale are used to obtain pressure-dependent shale gas permeability considering separate and combined effects of theses multi-physics. These data include gas permeability under a series of pore pressures and in-situ stress, and methane adsorption isotherms under laboratory temperatures. This work proposes a methodology to clearly describe shale gas permeability evolution during shale gas production. Based on our results, the geomechanical effect (increasing in-situ stress) is the dominating factor influencing gas apparent permeability, and the significance of slip flow and diffusion is highlighted under low pressures, and it even overwhelms that of the geomechanical effect and adsorption at a turning pressure point when gas apparent permeability begins to increases. |Introduction  |Despite the rapid growth of non-fossil fuels, fossil energy still is expected to account for 78% of the global energy consumption in 2040 (IEA 2016). Fossil fuel might still be the dominating energy supply because of its large amount (Jin et al. 2014; Sonnenberg et al. 2011; Jin and Sonnenberg 2013). Natural gas is probably the most promising fossil fuel and shale gas is a major component of natural gas supplies. Horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fractured wells provide great momentum for shale gas production (Theloy et al. 2013). However, the production mechanisms are not well understood due to the complex non-Darcy flow behaviors in the porous and fractured reservoirs (Wu 2015).|","Document Type

Maximizing recovery and profitability in a stacked-bench unconventional play is challenging because operators must optimize both the inter-bench vertical well spacing and the intra-bench lateral well spacing. |Generally, well interference can be detected by comparing well productivities, initial reservoir pressures, Stimulated Rock Volumes, and Expected Ultimate Recoveries against forecasted well performance. However, such analyses do not directly reveal whether any observed interference is due to inter-bench or intra-bench interactions. Without the ability to distinguish inter-bench interference from intra-bench interference in advance, vertical and lateral spacing optimization might be achieved only at the risk of over-capitalizing a development. |This paper presents a case study in which an analysis of GOR behavior was coupled with other analyses to determine the source of interference. Stand-alone (i.e., widely-spaced) wells in each bench were found to display unique GOR characteristics. When horizontal wells in different benches interfered with one another, however, the GOR trends observed in the wells were synchronized. |Wells with synchronized GORs exhibited substantial departure (better or worse) from expected performance, thereby confirming the hypothesis that they were interfering. Among wells that had synchronized GORs, in some cases, production from one well appeared to have been captured by another well, whereas in other cases, productivity of both wells were affected. |It was found that the contrast in the elastic properties of the stacked benches, which was discerned from the inversion of seismic data, played a key role in the vertical interference between wells. When stacked benches have similar elastic properties, much stronger interference was observed than when the elastic properties were dissimilar. As demonstrated by previous laboratory experiments (Thiercelen et al., 1987), mineback studies (Warpinski et al., 1981; Warpinski et al., 1987), and modeling (Thiercelen et al., 1987; Barree et al.; 1998; Smith et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2007), a large contrast in the elastic properties between benches appears to create flow barriers at the interface.|",""

In addition, recently, refracturing and infill drilling have gained much attention as efficient methods to enhance recovery in shale reservoirs. However, current approaches present difficulties in efficiently and accurately simulating such processes, especially for large-scale cases with complex hydraulic and natural fractures. |In this study, a general numerical method compatible with existing simulators is developed to model dynamic behaviors of complex fractures. The method is an extension of an embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM). With a new set of EDFM formulations, the non-neighboring connections (NNCs) in the EDFM are treated as regular connections in traditional simulators, and the NNC transmissibility factors are linked with gridblock permeabilities. Hence, manipulating block permeabilities in simulators can conveniently control the fluid flow through fractures. Complex dynamic behaviors of hydraulic fractures and natural fractures can be investigated using this method. |The proposed methodology is implemented in a commercial reservoir simulator in a non-intrusive manner. We first present a case study in a shale-oil reservoir to verify the model accuracy. Subsequently, four field-scale case studies with complex fractures in both 2D and 3D are presented to illustrate the applicability of the method. These studies involve vertical and horizontal well refracturing in tight reservoirs, infill drilling, and fracture activation in a naturally fractured reservoir. The proposed approach is combined with empirical correlations and geomechanical criteria to model stress-dependent fracture conductivity and natural fracture activation.

If natural fractures (NFs) present, the additional mechanical anisotropy is introduced within the bedding plane, making the shale an orthorhombic (OB) medium. Ignoring the anisotropic elastic rock behavior can result in erroneous estimates of the elastic moduli and the stress, and consequently the problematic or suboptimal drilling, completion, and hydraulic fracturing design. Previous study has been conducted to understand the impact of the shale lamination anisotropy on design of drilling, staging, perforating, and hydraulic fracturing (Khan et al., 2012; Gu et al., 2016). The objective of the current study is to investigate the combining effects of the two shale anisotropies from shale lamination and NFs on shale reservoir operation and development design. |In the current study, the stiffness tensors of an orthorhombic shale rock model are built by introducing one set of NFs in a VTI background based on the theory developed by Far et al. (2013). Then, the VTI model, which ignores the anisotropy induced by NFs, and the isotropic model, which ignores both the fracture induced anisotropy and the lamination induced anisotropy, are applied to the same synthetic OB rock to interpret the stiffness coefficients, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, minimum horizontal stress, min/max hoop stresses, brittleness index, and fractured width. The results are compared with the “true” values interpreted from the original OB rock model and the impacts of the two types of shale anisotropy (natural fractures & lamination) on drilling, completion, and fracturing design are examined. |According to the modeling results, ignoring shale anisotropy in geophysical logging analysis can lead to an overestimation of the minimum horizontal stress magnitude and the stress contrast; the overestimation is larger for stiffer zones and less tectonic active zones. Ignoring shale anisotropy can also lead to an overoptimistic design of mud margins, leading to higher risks of borehole tensile and shear failures. Ignoring shale anisotropy will not alter the brittleness index trend observed in the OB rock, hence will have limited impact on the perforation location selection. However, the stress contrast is overestimated when treating an OB rock as a VTI or isotropic medium, which will lead to a design of shorter stage spacing. If ignoring the anisotropy induced by the NFs, the fracture width is underestimated, which can lead to insufficient proppant size or pumping amount design resulting in sub-optimal low fracture conductivity design. The overestimation of the stress containment by ignoring shale anisotropy can lead to an overestimation of the fracture length and underestimation of the fracture height. Reflecting on the fracturing design, the fracturing fluid viscosity and the pumping rate will be over-designed. If the natural fracture density is low enough, ignoring NF induced anisotropy will have limited impacts on the drilling mud window design while negligible impacts on the completion and fracturing pumping design.|",""

The high frequency of lithological variability observed in most unconventional reservoirs yields the need to characterize the small scale lithological changes. Most mudrock successions are heterogeneous and exhibit facies changes on the scale of inches, which is particularly problematic when most down-hole logging tools have a sampling resolution of 1.5 to 2 feet. Down-hole log data serve as the basis for many petrophysical and geomechanical models as inputs to various completion and reservoir simulations. With this understanding, collecting high resolution data sets (core) to calibrated low resolution data (field logs) has become a viable approach for better optimization techniques. The use of sub log-scale analytical techniques will be examined, specifically, geochemical/mineralogical and Unconfined Compressive rock Strength (UCS) testing on three cores from the lower Bone Spring formation of the southern Delaware Basin, West Texas. The effects of sampling scale on volumetric calculations, lithofacies and wellbore stability will be explored to exemplify the contrasting results when samples are not taken at an appropriate resolution. Once relationships are established between geochemical signatures (XRF, XRD, UCS and TOC) and down-hole logs within one well, calibrated well logs can be developed from the high tier data well and extended to nearby offset wells to model any new area of interest. These relationships can be used to infer rock properties from nearby wells where geochemical data from core and petrophysical logs may not exist. Examples of how these relationships can be extrapolated between wells will be demonstrated for the three Bone Spring cores and for nearby wells using cuttings data. Preliminary results show good correlation between the high resolution geochemical data and sonic log as well as between the UCS calculated from rock hardness testing and sonic. |Introduction  |Energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) has become a mainstay geochemical technique in the petroleum industry, especially in the analysis of mudstone-dominated successions.

This provides an important dataset when evaluating development spacing and completion optimization. Assessment of over 50 microseismic surveys in the Midland Basin, spanning three counties, reveals that microseismic can be used to detect variations in hydraulic fracture geometry between landing points and with different completion designs. The development of a systematic workflow allows for the interpretation of microseismic data with a relatively high degree of confidence. |Microseismic surveys are first organized into a comprehensive database together with relevant completion and geologic data for consistent analysis. Microseismic events are analyzed in conjunction with time-series treatment data, allowing insight into whether fracture networks develop uniformly throughout treatment or are concentrated within a specific time window. Looking at microseismic events together with their corresponding fracture stages and perforations also provides valuable insight into perforation efficiency and stress shadowing effects. Microseismic heat maps are then generated for each survey, which illustrate a collective look at the overall event density and fracture geometry for a given well. These maps are used to assign an average fracture half-length, as well as upward and downward height growth for each well. General observations of fracture geometry, such as planar versus complex fracture networks, can also be made by observing event propagation through time together with the associated heat maps. Heat maps aid in identifying not only fracture symmetry around the wellbore, but also fracture barriers that can impede fracture growth. The identification of possible fracture barriers is critical for integration into future development plans. |Utilizing the developed database and workflow allows for correlation between interpreted microseismic fracture properties, landing zones and specific elements of the completion design.

Depletion of parent wells with non-uniform fracture geometries is incorporated in the study, which has not been researched thoroughly in the literature. Results show that magnitude and orientation of principal stresses are greatly altered by depletion and the alteration is uneven due to non-uniform fracture geometries. Stress reversal monitored at the center of the infill location starts after one year of production and it takes another eight months to be totally reversed for 90°. We also performed sensitivity studies to examine effects of parameters on changes of magnitude and orientation of stress at the infill location, and found out that effects of bottomhole pressure (BHP), differential stress (DS), and fracture geometry of parent wells are all significant, while effects of the reservoir elastic property are limited.

In this research, a numerical modeling approach, combining Particle Flow Code (PFC) with lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulation, was adopted to advance the understanding of the hydraulic fracture conductivity as a function of proppant concentration under various effective stresses from partial monolayer to multilayer proppant concentrations. PFC was used to simulate effective stress increase and the resultant proppant particle movement and rearrangement during the process of reservoir depletion due to hydrocarbon production. The pore structure of the proppant pack was extracted and used as boundary conditions of the LB simulation to calculate the time-dependent permeability of the proppant pack. We first validated the PFC-LB numerical workflow, and the simulated proppant pack permeabilities as functions of effective stress were in good agreement with laboratory measurements. Furthermore, several proppant packs were generated with various proppant concentrations, ranging from partial monolayer proppant packs to multilayer ones. The fracture conductivities for proppant packs from partial monolayers to multilayers were simulated. A partial monolayer proppant pack with large-diameter proppants may be an alternative to increase the fracture conductivity. Then, three proppant packs with the same average diameter but different diameter distributions were generated. Specifically, we used the coefficient of variation (COV) of diameter, defined as the ratio of standard deviation of diameter to mean diameter, to characterize the heterogeneity of particle size. We obtained proppant pack porosity, permeability, and fracture width reduction (compressed distance) as functions of effective stress. Under the same effective stress, a proppant pack with a higher diameter COV had lower porosity and permeability and larger fracture width reduction. This was because the high diameter COV gave rise to a wider diameter distribution of proppant particles; smaller particles were compressed into the pore space between larger particles with the increasing stress, leading to larger compressed distance and lower porosity and permeability. The transition time distributions for proppant packs with diameter COV5% and COV19% were determined and hydrocarbons transported more difficultly within the COV19% proppant geometry. With identical stress increase, the proppant assembly having a more heterogeneous particle diameter distribution experienced more dramatic changes with respect to pore structure and connectivity, which directly led to a reduced hydrocarbon transport in the hydraulic fracture.|",""

This procedure integrates petrophysics, rock typing, 3D seismic elastic properties, and geostatistics to build the reservoir model, and then directly incorporates the reservoir results into fracture model designs. This methodology was used on the Cretaceous Niobrara formation in the DJ basin where horizontal pad drilling has been in practice for several years with much experimentation by operators in terms of well spacing, stage spacing, fluids, and proppant volumes. As a result of the recent industry downturn, operators are now more focused on increasing recovery factors in a DSU while maintaining individual well economics, i.e., return on capital employed (ROCE). This new process directly addresses those concerns, which will enable Niobrara operators to make more informed decisions going forward with regard to number of wells per DSU and optimized fracture designs. |Statistical Rock Physics  |An applied statistical rock physics approach for reservoir characterization integrates fundamental petrophysical concepts of effective porosity, hydrocarbon saturation, and geomechanics with statistical and non-statistical pattern recognition, 3D seismic attribute analysis, and geostatistical modeling.|",""

However, if downhole shale samples are used, the comparison can be compromised or even biased due to significant sample variations caused by shale heterogeneity. The heterogeneity often leads to quite different mineralogy and mechanical properties among shale samples, even for those harvested from the same reservoir whole core. The variations in these properties have a strong impact on fracture conductivity, and create difficulties in evaluating and comparing different fracturing fluids. |In this work, the “half-core” approach is developed to obtain shale samples with almost identical properties to improve the evaluation on fracturing fluids. In this approach, shale cores are split into two half cores, which are then subjected to different fluids independently. 16 preserved shales from Barnett, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Utica spanning a wide range of mineralogy were used to investigate the effectiveness of the approach. Mineralogy and mechanical properties on the half-core surfaces were compared. Measured and simulated fracture conductivities between paired half cores were also examined. |The half cores demonstrated similar mineralogy and mechanical properties. Among all the 16 selected shales, their paired half cores showed an average difference of 3.22 ± 1.90 % in mineralogy and of 6.89 ± 8.45 % in hardness. The differences were substantially reduced compared to the shale samples from a vertical well in the Utica Basin and those from a horizontal well in the Midland Basin, whose average mineralogical differences range from 30% to 40 %. Similar fracture conductivities were also found between the half cores subjected to a series of closure stress: difference in the measured fracture conductivities between half cores from an Eagle Ford shale varied from 1.1% to 10.7%; while the simulated conductivities between the 16 pairs of half cores presented an average difference of 15.3% ± 18.9%. The differences in both of the measured and simulated fracture conductivities between half cores were lower than the conductivity difference among shales when the traditional approach is used. |The half-core approach is experimentally proved to be effective in creating a baseline with reduced sample variation among shales to improve evaluation of fracturing fluids. The approach is applicable in both propped and unpropped fractures.|",""

Here we follow up and concentrate on the stress variations along two WDFD horizontal wells. The available stress data in the study area comes primarily from two sub-parallel horizontal wells (Wells B and D) in the WDFD and a vertical well located between and near the center sections of the two horizontals. Each horizontal well is approximately 5,500 feet long and fractured by around 14 stages, and the two wells are about 1,500 feet apart. A limited number of stress measurements (via diagnostic fracture injection tests (DFIT’s)) performed in the three formations along the vertical well generally established a Shmin gradient slightly above what is permitted under frictional equilibrium when assuming Sv is the maximum principal stress (Ma and Zoback, 2017) (Figure 1). However, the instantaneous shut-in pressures (ISIP’s) measured during each hydraulic fracturing stage depict significant variations in the estimated Shmin magnitude along both WDFD wells (Figure 1, Figures 2b and 3b). The estimated Shmin values generally scatter between the lower bound set by the frictional equilibrium and the overburden stress (Sv).|",""

A major operator in the Haynesville shale was interested in determining the optimum method to refracture several laterals located directly offset to each other. In this case, a four-well pad was initially drilled to drain the section. The viability and optimum sequence/design of refracturing this four-well pad was unknown. There were many uncertainties around refracturing this pad including refracturing approach/method, refracture timing, refracture sequence (well order), refracture job size, and number of wells to refracture to obtain the greatest return on investment. |In this paper, an integrated refracturing workflow was created and applied to determine the optimum refracturing strategy for this four-well pad. This comprehensive workflow represents a multidisciplinary approach that integrates complex hydraulic fracture models, geomechanical models, and multiwell production simulation. The unique approach in this workflow was the ability to couple simulated 3D reservoir pressure with a geomechanical finite-element model (FEM) to quantify the changes to the magnitude and azimuth of the in-situ stresses from the depletion. Then, the altered stress field was utilized as the input for modeling the new fracture system created by the refracturing treatment.

Patterns and mechanisms of them were validated by analyzing regional geology and tectonic evolution. Then Discrete Fracture Network method was used to build multiscale natural fracture model. Deterministic method was applied for macro and meso fractures and stochastic method was used for micro factures. Multiple sets of natural fractures were identified and their properties were assigned per the corresponding seismic ant-tracking responses. Finally, a systematic quality control approach was conducted to valid the model. |Our experience suggests that the stacked seismic cube can have optimized angles for stacking in order to enhance the features of multiscale natural fractures, distinguish sub-seismic micro-folds from micro-faults and natural fracture corridors, as well as eliminate artificial signals from ant-tracking.

Strong evidence for this particular microseismic mechanism comes from a variety of microseismic projects. Much of this evidence is based on geophysical investigation of microseismic fault-plane solutions, with interpretations relying on conceptual models and geological analogs. Understanding microseismic mechanisms is critical to quantitatively link the microseismicity with the hydraulic fracture geometry, and ultimately to extract maximal value from the monitoring data. In this paper, we explore reservoir geomechanical conditions leading to BPFS using a coupled hydraulic-mechanical simulation. |BPFS was found to be the primary source mechanism of microseismicity detected during Wolfcamp hydraulic fracture stimulations. A hydraulic-geomechanical simulation was used to investigate fracture network growth and the associated microseismic response characteristics. A minor amount of slip was found in a scenario when only bed-parallel, pre-existing fractures were included. However, the microseismic intensity is not sufficient for these events to be detected in the field and are restricted to a region where the hydraulic fracture crossed a change in fracture gradient. Inclusion of pre-existing vertical fractures along with the bed-parallel resulted in microseismically detectable BPFS. Sensitivity studies of changing various geomechanical attributes of the reservoir, indicate most factors that promote Coulomb slip conditions promote a BPFS microseismic mechanism. |Introduction  |Microseismic monitoring is a common imaging technique to map hydraulic fracture growth in unconventional reservoirs. During hydraulic fracture growth, microseismicity is generated as the hydraulic fracture interacts with pre-existing fractures, causing slip and associated microseismic sources. Observing the location and timing of the microseismicity provides an ability to understand the hydraulic fracture growth and is often interpreted to describe the fracture characteristics and geometry. |Interest in microseismic source mechanisms is increasing as the source mechanism provides additional information about the microseismic sources. Source mechanism studies range from fault-plane solutions that use “beach-ball diagrams” to represent the fracture orientation and sense of shear slip on the surface, to full moment tensor inversion that estimate the full range of potential source deformation including opening along with shearing (e.g., Maxwell, 2014). In certain cases, source mechanisms have identified slip on bed-parallel fractures (BPFS) as a predominant microseismic mechanism (e.g., Rutledge et al., 2013, Rutledge et al., 2015).

Over the years, completion and stimulation design in horizontal wells has evolved from conservative to radical designs. It has also progressed from exploration mode to full development, and from single-well pads to multi-well pads and stacked laterals. In field development mode, infill drilling between pre-existing wells that have been on production for some time is typically done. Production interference has been observed to occur and known to have negative impact on pre-existing (parent) wells. The parent well would cause reservoir depletion resulting in localized “pressure sinks” that can cause the infill (child) well’s hydraulic fractures to grow towards the pressure sink and damage the parent well. In addition, the production potential of the child well is likely to decrease because of the pressure sinks (depleted area). The main purpose of this paper is to understand the impact of different well spacing configurations on well interference and production performance in unconventional reservoirs. This paper is an extension of a previous work presented by Ajisafe et al. (2016) on the use of discrete fracture network (DFN) from seismic data for complex fracturing modeling. |A multi-disciplinary integrated workflow was applied in a multi-well pad, with an extensive dataset consisting of seismic, high-tier vertical and horizontal logs and microseismic data. The multi-well pad consists of two wells, a parent well that has been completed and put on production for a year, and a new (child) well to be completed on the same pad. Two different well spacings were investigated, at 660 feet and 1,320 feet to understand the negative impact of interference on the parent well production, as well as the performance of the child well due to reservoir pressure depletion of the parent well. To mitigate/avoid the negative impact of production interference on the parent well and to improve performance of the child well, the child well was landed deeper in the Avalon shale. |The DFN model and geomechanical properties were key inputs into understanding the complex fracture geometry constrained with microseismic data for the parent well. Seismic data provided an improved DFN model along and particularly away from the wellbore. The different models are discussed in detail in Ajisafe et al. (2016). The reservoir pressure depletion pattern and complex fracture geometry were then used as key input into a geomechanics simulator for an updated in-situ stress state at 1 year, which was then used for complex fracture modeling of the child well. The effect of a year of production-induced depletion on the parent well shows a change in the reservoir pressure, horizontal stress magnitude and maximum horizontal stress azimuth.

In an attempt to hold leases, larger well spacing and sub-optimal completions were sometimes used. In most cases, this led to insufficient drainage of the targeted hydrocarbon reserves. Refracturing and drilling infill wells are strategies to recover more oil and gas from these reservoirs, however, both strategies present significant challenges that need to be addressed. |Refracturing partially depleted horizontal wells sometimes results in inefficient re-stimulation of depleted intervals. Diverting agents are used to divert fluid and proppant to un-depleted zones along the well. Field evidence suggests that biased stimulation of some sections of the well still occurs even after the use of these diverting agents. A novel strategy to reduce this depletion induced bias was tested in the field. This strategy suggested the injection of fluid at a very low rate for an extended duration before ramping up the rate and executing the refracturing job. “Slow-injection” of fluid prior to refracturing can help in increasing pore pressure and stress along the entire lateral by repressurizing depleted existing fractures and the rock matrix immediately around these fractures. This induced increase in pressure and local stress is temporary and may last only a few hours or days but can be helpful in distributing the refracturing fluid in a more uniform manner into all fractures (new and old) as well as improving the placement of diverters throughout the lateral. |The proposed low-rate repressurization strategy was simulated using a fully 3-D poro-elastic geo-mechanical model. The results helped in understanding the impact of this slow-injection phase on the pressures and stresses that develop during depletion and repressurization.

The vertical nodal plane is roughly parallel to the maximum stress, with no simple explanation for the shear stress necessary to cause it to slip. The horizontal plane is more easily explained by the shear stress concentration at the tip of a vertically propagating hydraulic fracture. Supporting this interpretation is the fact that the range of azimuthal directions from vertical nodal planes is often more complex than commonly occurs with other nodal plane orientations. The implication of this evidence is that these events occur at the termination of vertical hydraulic fracture growth or at layer boundaries between rocks with different mechanical properties. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined multiple data sets through moment tensor inversion using the horizontal-slip interpretation. The horizontal-slip interpreted events were then analyzed using a geomechanical model of the area. The magnitude and degree of layer varying mechanical properties along with the local geologic dip support the correlation of horizontal nodal plane orientation with bedding plane slip theory. Also observed in the data sets were strike-slip type events which correlated with known fracture orientations from geomechanical logs. |Introduction |Early attempts at characterizing source orientations of microseismic events assumed a double-couple mechanism due to limited observations, such as being constrained to a single vertical monitoring array. These results typically revealed strike-slip type mechanisms interpreted as slip on pre-existing fractures (Rutledge and Phillips 2003) or vertical dip-slip mechanisms that suggested the possibility of bedding plane slip (Rutledge et. al. 2014). With the prevalence of multiple arrays, improved characterization of these sources is now possible. Of the two data sets we examine, with nearly full focal sphere coverage, one reveals dominant strike-slip failure on a set of pre-existing natural fractures, and the other is dominated by events that we interpret as bedding plane slip. |Theory |Microseismic events have traditionally been associated with pore pressure diffusion and the associated failure resulting from the reduction in normal stress on fracture planes in a triaxial stress environment. In tight unconventional reservoirs with very low leak-off, direct communication of the hydraulic fracture with the natural fractures likely leads to slip along those fractures.|",""

The process reactivates pre-existing fractures around a hydraulic fracture causing them to slip and dilate and can also cause fracture propagation in the shear and tensile modes creating secondary cracks resulting in increased permeability. Control and optimization of shear stimulation can be achieved by studying how fluid flows through fractures as the stresses (shear and normal) change and how fracture permeability evolves with slip. However, laboratory data on fluid flow and fracture slip in reservoir rocks particularly shale rocks are rare, and the mechanisms of permeability evaluation with shear slip and dilation are still not well understood. In this paper, we present the results of a laboratory scale testing program to address these questions. Salt water (7% kcl) was injected into the two Eagle Ford shale samples under triaxial conditions having a single natural or an induced tensile fracture to induce shear slip, and flow rates during shear slip processes were measured to characterize fracture permeability evolution. In addition, fluid flow through shale fractures under different values of confining stress and injection pressure were examined to investigate the stress-dependent permeability of shale fractures. The hydrostatic flow tests show that flow rate linearly rises with the increase of injection, while an exponential relationship can be observed between flow rate and effective confining pressure. In the injection-driven shear tests, we achieved 6 to 15 times increase in flow rate even with only small shear sliding (<0.1 mm) induced. In addition, permeability tends to linearly evolve with the increase of shear slip and normal dilation. The results quantify the role of shear slip in enhancing permeability of shale fractures, and would help engineer solutions for maintaining these fractures open, reducing costs (proppant/water and additive cost savings).|","Document Type

In conventional fracturing, the fluid pressure is increased monotonically to reach failure in a single cycle. The maximum pressure for the failure can be reduced if we increase and decrease the fluid pressure cyclically (cyclic fracturing). More acoustic events, which correspond to a larger enhancement in the stimulated region’s permeability, are recorded in cyclic fracturing. In the present study, we discuss the difference between the recorded events for the two methods. Four blocks of Tennessee sandstone were hydraulically fractured under triaxial stress: two under conventional loading and two under cyclic loading. We also use a modified Paris law to predict the breakdown pressure in cyclic fracturing, based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), which treats the solid domain as an isotropic and linear elastic medium. We use the two conventional tests and one cyclic test to determine the unknown parameters in the modified Paris law. The tuned model, with determined parameters, can help us design an optimum scenario that is fundamentally different from the conventional method for formation stimulation. The results are promising and more lab measurements are required to test the accuracy of the developed model. |Introduction |Hydraulic fracturing has become an essential part of the petroleum industry, as it enables us to produce hydrocarbon from tight formations by improving their transport properties. Most of the existing techniques are based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM); thus, that topic is briefly reviewed here. |Inglis (1913) started linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) by analyzing the stress field around an elliptical crack in brittle materials. He proposed that the stress at the crack tip is proportional to the length of the major axis of the crack and the tensile load. Later, Griffith (1920) used the energy balance criterion to derive a relation for crack propagation. Irwin (1957) described the stress at the crack tip in terms of the stress intensity factor (SIF).|","Document Type

Recent applications show that thermal expansion of CO2 can induce thermal effects, which can assist fracture initiation and propagation. This phenomenon needs to be carefully addressed to improve the understanding of CO2 thermodynamic behavior and thus help field operators to optimize CO2 fracturing in shale gas reservoirs. Firstly, we develop a numerical model to simulate the impact of thermodynamic and heat transfer behavior on fracture initiation during CO2 fracturing. The velocity and pressure are calculated based on continuity and momentum equations. The temperature is obtained by solving energy equation. The thermal stress is derived based on the stress-strain relation to investigate the thermal effect of CO2 fracturing. Secondly, based on CO2 density calculation, we propose an iteration method to determine the formation build-up pressure after CO2 fracturing. CO2 diffusion in formation is also considered to account for the influence of CO2 volume variation on the build-up pressure. |The numerical model is verified by comparing the simulated pressure and temperature changes with the observation in laboratory experiments. The simulation results indicate that CO2 in the fracture is in the condition of subsonic compressible flow during fracture initiation. A pseudo shock wave is observed associated with a compression wave and an expansion wave. The temperature of CO2 increases in the new fracture while decreases in the initial fracture during fracture initiation. Temperature response is much slower than velocity and pressure response, and temperature can reach a stable state in a shorter period. The temperature change results in thermal stress around the fracture, which can further assist fracture initiation and propagation. Larger thermal stress can be induced in shale for its relatively high Young’s modulus. After shutting in, CO2 in fractures and pores will be heated to or close to the initial formation temperature. Then the pressure increases and builds up because of the high expansibility of CO2. The build-up pressure increases linearly with the increasing fluid temperature and decreases significantly as CO2 diffuses through porous rock. Larger build-up pressure can be achieved in shale play for its extremely low permeability. Although an increasing number of CO2 fracturing wells have been tested in China and North America, relatively few models exist to quantitatively simulate the thermodynamic behavior of CO2 fracturing. This work investigates the thermal stress during fracture initiation and the build-up pressure after fracturing, which provides an improved understanding of the impacts of thermodynamic behavior on CO2 fracturing in shale.|",""

Reservoir characterization is key to identify both the sweet spots and optimum completion zones. Rock typing is an integral part of the reservoir characterization workflow which identifies different flow units. In this work, we present an integrated workflow for rock typing using lab petrophysical measurements and well logs acquired from six wells in the Wolfcamp formation in the Permian basin. Only three wells had cores. The petrophysical measurements were sampled every 3 feet interval from 900 feet of continuous core recovered from these three wells. Unsupervised clustering algorithms like K-means and Self Organizing Maps (SOM) were used to define rock types. |Rock Type 1 is characterized by the highest porosity (7-10%) and TOC (4-6%). Not surprisingly, Rock Type 1 had the highest positive impact on well productivity. Rock Type 2 had intermediate values of porosity (6-8%) and TOC (3-4.5%) and moderate source potential and storage. Rock Type 3 had the highest carbonate (60-80%) content and poor storage and source rock potential (2-4% TOC, 4-7% porosity). Rock Type 3 was the worst rock type. |A classifier from well log data that is conditioned to core data was created. The classifier was applied at depth locations where core data were not available. The classifier included GR and neutron porosity logs. These logs were used as these were the commonly available logs in all the wells used in the study. We define a rock type ratio (RTR) based on the fraction of Rock Type 1 over total perforation. RTR was found to strongly correlate with oil production rate. The advantage of the workflow developed here is that it can easily be generalized to diverse data types and other plays in different geologic settings. |INTRODUCTION  |The improvement in the rate of success of wildcat drilling from 75% in 1974 to 95% in 2010 has been widely attributed to improvements in reservoir characterization techniques (Williams 2008). One of these techniques, rock typing, is central to meaningful interpretation of the diverse data types acquired over diverse length scales and with varying resolutions. This is true for both conventional and unconventional reservoirs.|",""

However, with careful analysis, the data offers a wealth of geomechanical and rock physics information not only about the formation in which the tool is located, but about nearby formations as well. This not only allows for production optimization by understanding how fractures will propagate, but also suggests geosteering opportunities, such as placing the lateral a safer distance from nearby boundaries, or steering the well to stay within the most “fracable” portion of the shale. |A case study is presented, considering azimuthal acoustic data that was acquired in a thinly-bedded formation. The target formation is heterogeneous and thinly-bedded with highly-contrasting rocks acting as both source and reservoir in the hydrocarbon petroleum system. In this particularly challenging example, the borehole straddled the interface of two highly contrastive beds for much of the length of the lateral. Initial sonic interpretation using conventional methods led to confusing results; it was difficult to understand whether the velocities pertained to the upper formation, lower formation, or beds even further away. |A new workflow was applied to try to systematically characterize the sonic properties for each layer. This involves visualizing the environment, determining the sonic velocities for each quadrant (up, down, left, right), and using the visualization to determine which velocities (and thus elastic properties) belong to each layer. Once elastic properties for each layer were understood, it is possible to try to solve the problem of how the complex fracture propagation should be modelled in these challenging environments. When further combined with natural fracture information (from image logs or sonic fracture detection), core measurements, and past production from nearby wells, these analyses can be used as a guide for modifying and optimizing completions. |INTRODUCTION  |The stratigraphy of the Delaware Wolfcamp is unique amongst “unconventional” plays. It is thinly bedded, composed of mixed fine grain carbonates (siliciclastic lithotypes) and exhibits highly contrastive “stiff” and “soft” facies (Thiercelin and Plumb, 1994).|",""

Utilization of these in-situ measurements to design well completions has proven effective by allowing entry points to be placed within “like rock” groupings, yielding higher perforation efficiency during stimulation. However, the economic and operational burden to collect this data often prevents it from being collected regularly. |Current industry practice is to calculate these rock mechanical properties from dipole sonic logs. Unfortunately, the present level of technology for sonic tools yields measurement of, at most, three stiffness coefficients (C33, C44, C66) in an ideal well. If the target formation is isotropic this is sufficient because only two coefficients are required to generate a fully realized solution. In a vertically transverse isotropic (VTI) formation, however, we must estimate the remaining unknowns including the critical C13 tensor (Quirein & Cheng, 2014 Modified ANNIE). Therefore, in order to fully describe the rock mechanics matrix, additional measurements or technology is required. |Continuous, high-resolution measurements of near-bit drilling induced vibrations provide an alternative technique to obtain these stiffness coefficients. Vibrations are recorded by mounting a set of tri-axial accelerometers on a 12” bit sub positioned directly behind the bit. In this recording configuration, the near-bit accelerations provide a measurement of the forces acting at the bit and the motions of the bit-rock interaction. |Typical values of near-bit accelerations used to represent the forces acting on the formation can be on the order of several gravities. Typical values of the displacement of the bit as determined from processing the near-bit accelerations are on the order of several micrometers. Because these values represent accelerations and displacements as opposed to stress and strain, geometric or other scalar corrections are applied to determine relative values of the mechanical rock properties. Thus, using these innovative new stress-strain relationships with respect to the material symmetry of formation and well orientation, it is possible to obtain the stiffness coefficients and thereby the rock mechanical properties. |There are, of course, potential issues with measuring rock mechanics while drilling; one is the question of whether the Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio are static or dynamic. The DDL data is more closely associated with the dynamic data since it is calibrated to the dipole sonic tool response. Therefore, static to dynamic corrections are still required. Also, changes in downhole assemblies and drilling techniques must be accounted for in the processing. |A comparison from a two-mile lateral in the isotropic Bakken reservoir near Williston, ND, is presented contrasting open-hole horizontal logs including triple combo, dipole sonic, image logs and this new downhole rock mechanics measurement. Post-processed data shows rock mechanical properties can be positively identified using this new technology.|","Document Type

The study was carried out on samples from Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford formations. |Cleaning has a major impact on various petrophysical properties like porosity (increases up to 50%), S1 (decreases up to 90%) and surface area (increases by 450 %). The study showed that cleaning time is a function of maturity and sample state. Samples in the oil maturity window are much more difficult to clean compared to the samples in the gas maturity window.

The reservoir intervals consist of a series of stacked Pleistocene sands, silts and shales derived from the proto-Orinoco, with thick marine claystones forming seals. The reservoir sands are generally unconsolidated with good porosity and permeability. Hydrocarbon composition is primarily dry gas with minor condensate. |The laminated formations within the reservoir have been a long standing challenge due to poor quality core acquisition and handling, insufficient data acquisition and rugous wellbore conditions. Previous attention has been focused on understanding the water saturation modelling in the belief that accounting for resistivity anisotropy would solve the low resistivity pay situation. It has been demonstrated that investigating water saturation alone does not yield results consistent with production behaviour. |Unconsolidated sediments tend to have higher compressibility than potentially expected causing less depletion due to the compaction effect. In combination with a geomechanical study and core from Well X, uniaxial pore volume compressibility was refined, improving volume estimation and thus production forecasting. |This study will show that careful core handling and preparation to preserve the clay properties in tandem with improved log acquisition, shed light on the need for accurate lithology description to enable water saturation to be modelled realistically. It is demonstrated that whether an effective or total water saturation model is used the same hydrocarbon volume is calculated and thus provides sense checks on the evaluation as a whole.

However, the translation of acoustic waveforms to anisotropic velocities and stress directions is often seen as a “black art”. While the acoustics specialist knows just how factors such as flexural mode dispersion, drilling induced stress, high angle fractures, hole washout, centralisation and tool calibration affect the data, the end user generally doesn’t want to delve deeply into such details, but just wants to know if the results are valid for a particular application. |Thus, while this paper will begin with a review of the common industry methods of processing acoustic anisotropy, the main focus will be on the quality control and understanding how to identify common issues in the delivered results. To that end, a review of quality control plots and their interpretation will be presented, followed by numerous examples of valid and invalid processed results, with the goal of this work being not to instruct the user on how to fix problem datasets, but rather to detail a succinct workflow to identify when to trust anisotropy results and when to consider re-processing the waveform data. |Particular attention is paid to frequently asked questions, such as, “what is the difference between XX/YY processing and shear anisotropy analysis?”, “how do I interpret anisotropy in inclined and horizontal wells?”, “how off-centre can the tool be to get valid shear anisotropy results?”, “what does a dispersion crossover plot really mean?” and “can I get anisotropy from LWD?” |INTRODUCTION  |Acoustic anisotropy information is needed for many applications, yet the process for determining anisotropy and associated quality control methods are often poorly understood by the end user. This can cause users to incorporate incorrect results in various applications, leading to a lack of confidence in acoustic data.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that a model-based inversion of the formation and collar flexural dispersions properly accounts for the presence of the drill collar and yields both the fast and slow formation shear slownesses. However, the model-based workflow is based on an equivalent isotropic and homogeneous (EIH) formation model, and the estimated formation shear slowness might be compromised by model mismatches such as tool eccentricity, drilling-induced borehole damage, and strong formation anisotropy. |To mitigate some of these limitations, this paper describes a computationally efficient model-independent workflow to estimate the fast and slow shear slownesses in fast formations using LWD-sonic data. First, the proposed workflow exploits the existence of a higher-order formation flexural mode that is uncoupled from the dominant tool flexural mode. This uncoupling characteristic significantly reduces the complexity of processing algorithms to determine the formation shear slowness. Second, the proposed workflow is not based on any forward model and hence, is applicable to both isotropic and anisotropic formations. This model-independent workflow complements the model-based workflow and can be particularly useful in challenging logging environments such as LWD operations. |INTRODUCTION  |Borehole acoustic logging is a major part of subsurface formation evaluation for oil and gas exploration and production. It provides key inputs to the geophysical calibration of seismic imaging, petrophysical analyses, and the estimation of rock stresses and mechanical properties for fracture stimulation and wellbore stability analyses.

This Vp/Vs ratio is used in many industry analyses, such as the amplitude variation with offset (AVO) analysis developed by Castagna et al. (1993). Multiple authors have since published a variety of Vp/Vs seismic interpretation techniques that use empirical relationships with Vp, Vs, and porosity terms.

Different scenarios of perforation clusters were run to model propagation of multiple horizontal fractures and predict the changes in stress anisotropy in the neighborhood of the fractures. Results revealed that an increased number of perforation clusters attributed to increased stress interference from the outer fractures, causing reduced inner fracture half-length and resulting in longitudinal fracture propagation rather than transverse fractures, thus reducing the stimulated reservoir volume.

Unconventional formations typically have low permeability in the nano-darcy range, low porosities are common, and conventional petrophysical logs are inadequate for prolific zone identification and completion selection. |This discussion focuses on the development of a criterion to identify optimal lateral window and effective frac zones for completion, maximizing the recovery potential and rate of hydrocarbons from unconventional shales. |The specific well example used in this paper is located in the Powder River Basin in the U.S. and the wellbore traverses the Niobrara, Mowry and Muddy formations.

Brittleness index can generally be obtained from stress or strain based relationships. It can also be estimated from conventional well logs or rock mineralogical composition. Brittleness index measurements from stress/strain based relationships require laboratory tests, which are time-consuming and core samples are available only at discrete depths. While well logs can estimate a continuous profile of brittleness index along the borehole, it is derived from empirical correlation specific to a rock type. More recent advancements in logging tools have enabled the determination of elemental spectroscopy downhole. This information combined with petrophysical properties such as density and porosity can capture brittleness characteristics of rocks. This paper presents the use of support-vector regression (SVR) to construct a data-driven brittleness index prediction from the elemental spectroscopy and petrophysical properties. |The relationship of brittleness index with elemental spectroscopy, density, and porosity is often complex and nonlinear. The SVR described in this paper is used to correlate the elemental spectroscopy, density, and porosity to the brittleness index, thereafter building a data-driven brittleness index prediction model. The dataset of brittleness index, elemental spectroscopy, density, and porosity used in this study are based on various geological formations. Laboratory tests such as unconfined compressive strength, confined compressive strength, and Brazilian test were conducted. Brittleness indices were calculated based on data generated from these tests. Elemental spectroscopy data were obtained from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. The data are then separated into two categories: training and testing data. Training data are used to train the SVR and establish the brittleness index prediction model, while the testing data are used for validation. |In total, 28 cases were run with different combinations of petrophysical and mineralogical properties, number of training dataset, and SVR kernel functions. The results reveal that the SVR-based brittleness indices match very well with the laboratory-measured brittleness indices. Cross-correlation plots of regression models between the predicted and the measured brittleness indices show high values of coefficient of determination. The small error and high values of coefficient of determination denote the SVR models’ good performances. The prediction accuracy improves as more data are included to train the algorithm. From the comparison of SVR-kernel-function-based models, we observe that the RBF-based model performs better than the polynomial-based model. The RBF-based model yields better accuracy than the polynomial-based model using the same number of training dataset. Referring to the RBF-based model with 80% training dataset, it was observed that elemental spectroscopy has more influence than the other rock properties on the prediction. The promising results stemming from this study confirm that SVR can be further applied to build a brittleness index prediction model based on mineralogy logs and petrophysical logs.|",""

Drilling experience in the development wells highlighted the issue of wellbore instability in the respective study areas, particularly though coal seams. Numerous lost-time incidents related to wellbore instability-related problems were experienced, ranging from tight hole (remedied by reaming) to overpull, pack-off followed by stuck pipe, fill on-bottom to difficulties in running casing, and coal cavings to high gas associated with drilling breaks. These problems were observed particularly when drilling through the weak shales with interbedded unstable coals. |Coal instability often does not respond to the same remediation used in shale, where we usually simply raise the mud weight to reduce the compressional hoop stress below the strength of the rock. Borehole collapse or breakout may still occur when the coal cleats and natural fractures of the coal allow the drilling fluid filtrate to invade despite using an optimum mud weight. This results in pressurization of the near-wellbore region and loss of effective mud weight support for coal stability. All the wells in the respective fields were drilled with water-based mud (WBM) and so drilling performance benchmarking with other drilling fluids was not possible in the study area. Faced with continual non-productive time (NPT), a geomechanical study was initiated to mitigate the wellbore instability problems. The recommendations arising from the comprehensive geomechanical and drilling experience analyses have been implemented to improve performance during subsequent development drilling. |This paper highlights the importance of integrating geomechanics with proper drilling practices when developing strategies to mitigate unstable hole problems, especially related to coals. A full-scale geomechanical model was developed, validated and updated using logs and drilling data from wells in both the areas. The drilling experiences, rock mechanical properties, in-situ stresses and formation pressure in both the study areas are presented and discussed in detail. A detailed recommendation on the drilling strategy through coal and the associated uncertainties was implemented. Utilization of geomechanical results from the two studies and the approach adopted in the development of drilling strategies helped to determine recommended optimal mud weight programs for the future wells. Subsequent drilling campaigns have all been successful by incorporation of the entire risk and mitigation plan. This included a generalized road map with a protocol for drilling through coal, tripping and back reaming during drilling, pre-drilling and post-drilling. This effort, together with optimized drilling fluid design and the correct mud weight based on previous drilling experience as per recommended wellbore stability assessments, helped in two recently drilled wells in different areas with reduced non-productive time.|",""

This work investigates whether using detailed petrophysical and mechanical properties provides fracture design parameters that better represent actual fracture behavior and subsequent well performance than a single-layered model. |The approach was to model an existing hydraulic fracture treatment and well performance from a well located in the northern Delaware Basin producing from the lower Brushy Canyon Formation. Models varied from a single layer model with simple-averaged, petrophysical properties to a fine resolution 1-ft model with detailed petrophysical values. Detailed core descriptions were constructed to appropriately represent the thin-bedded and micro-laminated sandstones and siltstones. |In addition, point load tests measured values of fracture toughness for specific lithofacies from 600 to 1100 psi-in<U+00BD>. In comparison, the default value for a sandstone system is 1000 psi-in<U+00BD>. Other mechanical properties, e.g., Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus were derived from well logs, and were within typical values. |For the fracture modeling phase, the actual treatment volumes, rates and pressures were inputted into the model along with the measured petrophysical and mechanical properties. Model net pressure was matched with the actual values to verify the output. The dimensionless fracture conductivity (FCD) from the various models ranged from 4.8 to 13.6. The range depends on the variation of lithofacies included in the fine resolution models and their associated mechanical/petrophysical properties. Adding micro-laminated and bioturbated siltstones at the expense of clean sandstone in the finer resolution models resulted in higher permeability, fracture toughness and lower stress gradient. |For the production history matching phase, simulation pressures were significantly overestimated compared to actual measured bottomhole pressures for all single layer models regardless if actual or default mechanical properties were used. The overestimation reflects a threefold increase in pore volume due to the single layer values. For the finer resolution 1-ft model, the simulation pressure was significantly below measured pressure values using default mechanical properties. However, using actual mechanical properties in the 1-ft resolution model resulted in an increase in the FCD due to the decrease in fracture toughness and stress gradient input values. As a result, a very good match was obtained between simulation and actual pressures; indicating the 1-ft model with the measured mechanical properties is a good representation of the actual reservoir system.|",""

This is especially true for selecting intervals with the best productivity indices and to avoid perforating interbedded sand bodies with high mobile water saturation. Challenging operational conditions, including well integrity and stability, dictate that logging while drilling (LWD) solutions are the primary option, and wireline (WL) can be used to address specific challenges. In the case of the medium oil Miocene offshore field, formation evaluation answers are typically provided based on the latest LWD service including gamma ray, resistivity, density, neutron, sigma and elemental spectroscopy technologies, and special WL nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging was requested for estimation of the bound water volume and free fluid saturations. |Advanced wireline magnetic resonance today provides both standard NMR answers, such as lithology-independent porosity, bound and free fluid volumes, and a permeability computation, as well as continuous fluid typing based on measuring three independent physics properties of the formation — diffusion, T1 (polarization) and T2 (time decay in response to well defined pulses). Two unique capabilities of an expert magnetic resonance service are programmability and the ability to provide answers at multiple depths of investigation (DOIs). Design and optimization of the acquisition modes in this advanced NMR tool for the exact operational needs and formation evaluation challenges are governed by maximizing data quality while respecting limitations of overall rig time, minimum logging speed, and borehole conditions. |For the Miocene offshore field operations, rig time and well integrity dictated a crucial demand for a special design of the acquisition mode: the logging speed had to be above 320 ft/hr, fluid typing was required at multiple DOIs, and medium oil was the expected formation fluid. Note that existing fluid typing modes operate at a maximum speed of 250 ft/hr. As a percentage, the increase in logging speed was challenging to achieve and required detailed modeling and validation for the expected fluid properties. |A special NMR acquisition mode was designed and optimized for Miocene offshore operational challenges and formation properties. The mode represents one of the fastest possible diffusion–T1– T2 sequences with sensitivity to medium oil (as required) and also to light oil, and it provides answers at different DOIs into the formation. A successful continuous log of oil, water and gas volumes, covering over 1000 ft, was acquired in the operator’s Miocene offshore field wells in the beginning of 2015.

A stimulation treatment follows from, and is affected by, the set of processes that occur during well construction. The creation of the opening causes a major change in stress state, and may involve permanent rock deformations affecting the wall of the wellbore. Drilling practices seek to avoid such failures because of the immediate consequences associated with rock debris loading the well, but also because deformations provide pathways for fluids to invade the rocks where they may lead to further de-stabilisation via chemical interactions. A hydraulic stimulation treatment uses the pressures of injected fluids to cause rock breakage over a short period of time, creating new flow pathways. The mechanics of the stimulation process, at the moment of its initiation, is very like the condition of mud overbalance while drilling, where the wellbore is inflated to a larger-diameter condition. In stimulation treatments, this wellbore inflation and the resulting rock deformation responses, occur in a situation that already has been modified by the drilling actions. 
We describe numerical simulations of these near-well geomechanical processes, relating both to drilling and to stimulation activities, using a method that is based on a combined finite-discrete element formulation. The 2D numerical method treats the model domain initially as a continuum, but allows fractures to develop along any of the faces of the finite elements, with composite fractures able to grow into large and complex configurations. We show that an important factor is the removal of the rock mass from the drilled hole, which leads to a very different stress state around the opening compared to mathematical models that have a pre-existing hole in them. Depending on the far-field stress state and the material properties, the simulations of drilling often develop fracture arrays that are associated with borehole elongation in the far-field minimum stress direction (which is compatible with standard knowledge). Those arrays alter the near-well stress state in major ways. The numerical simulations also reveal the characteristics of deformation processes, involving fracturing and consequent strain changes, and thus their stress changes, which affect the part of the wellbore wall that is broadly aligned with the maximum far field stress. Except with the strongest and stiffest rocks, the fractures in this region initiate and develop mainly as shears, which contrasts sharply with the received wisdom for what is expected. This response also applies when we impose a stimulation loading inside the wellbore (fluid injection).|","wellbore geomechanics, stimulation"

Unconventional petroleum reservoirs, such as shale gas and tight oil reservoirs, have changed the entire energy equation in the world. An accurate and efficient reservoir simulator is essential for the development and management of these reservoirs and the optimization of their production schedules. However, the gas storage and transport mechanisms in ultra-tight matrix, including gas adsorption/desorption, non-Darcy flow, and surface diffusion, are different from those in conventional petroleum reservoirs. In addition, hydraulic fracturing techniques are often required to achieve their economical production, which leads to existence of complex fracture networks in the unconventional reservoirs. These features of unconventional reservoirs make their accurate numerical simulations a big challenge. In this paper, we develop a simulator for fractured unconventional reservoirs, which takes the specific gas storage and transport mechanisms into consideration, employs a multiple interacting continua (MINC) model to handle well connected natural fractures, utilizes an embedded discrete fracture model to simulate large-scale disconnected hydraulic fractures, and uses a coupled model to efficiently describe multi-scale fractures with irregular geometries. To reduce the computational time, parallel computing techniques are also employed, with which large-scale reservoir simulation cases can be finished in practical time. From the numerical experiments, we can see that reasonable physical phenomena is captured and accurate predictions are performed by this simulator.|","Discrete Fracture Method, Unconventional Reservoirs, Multi-scale Fractures, Multi-continuum Model, Parallel simulator"

Recently, the potential of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with CO2 injection in tight oil reservoir has drawn attention. Most of previous studies for CO2 injection in tight oil reservoir have considered only huff-and-puff process. However, CO2 flooding could show further improvement depending on the fracture-reservoir system. To investigate the effects of CO2 flooding and huff-and-puff processes in tight oil reservoir, numerical models incorporating molecular diffusion and stress-dependent deformation mechanisms were generated. In order to model the realistic tight oil reservoir, core and reservoir models were constructed with data from Bakken shale field. Coand counter-diffusive transport is depicted by Sigmund and Wilke correlation. Stress-dependent deformation in tight reservoir is considered by exponential correlation coupled with linear-elastic model. The developed models were used to investigate major factors affecting CO2 injection process such as molecular diffusion, stress-dependent compaction, and conductivity of fracture system. In the proposed model, about 8% of hydrocarbon was recovered during the primary production. Recoveries with CO2 flooding and huff-and-puff following primary production are increased to 18 and 15%, respectively. The main factor which facilitates CO2 flooding is the fracture conductivity of unstimulated zone. Because the middle Bakken formation shows relatively higher permeability and fracture conductivity than other ultra-tight reservoirs, the CO2 displaces the oil between wells with flooding. In case of the reservoir with lower fracture conductivity, on the ther hand, huff-and-puff process is better than flooding process for EOR. In addition, CO2 flooding process showed higher CO2 storage than huff-and-puff process. CO2 flooding method stores 1.7 times higher CO2 than huff-and-puff method. About 91% of injected CO2 is stored for CO2 flooding and about 54% of injected CO2 is stored for huff-and-puff. Therefore, the need to develop CO2 flooding techniques is evident in order to improve not only the oil recovery but the CO2 storage. The investigation of CO2 flooding and huff-and-puff with comprehensive numerical model suggests better understanding and design of CO2 injection in order to improve the efficiency of CO2 EOR and storage in tight oil reservoirs.|","shale oil, molecular diffusion, co2 injection, tight oil, stress-dependent compaction"

During recent field applications of polymer flooding in unconsolidated reservoirs, questions have arisen concerning the role of compaction and/or dilation on flood performance. The primary goal for this paper was to assess the extent to which the compressible nature of a formation affects polymer flooding. The Tambaredjo field in Suriname (with in-situ oil viscosity ~600 cp) was used as a model for this study. Comparisons were made during simulations where formation compressibility was 5.6 <U+00D7> 10-4 psi-1 versus 1 <U+00D7> 10-6 psi-1. During a simulated 17-year compaction drive with compressibility of 5.6 <U+00D7> 10-4 psi-1, water cut gradually increased to average 20% (consistent with the actual field performance)—compared to 2% if compressibility was 1 <U+00D7> 10-6 psi-1. Oil recovery during this period was 18% OOIP for the highcompressibility case versus 3% OOIP for the low-compressibility case. Subsequent to the above compaction drive, incremental oil recoveries from waterflooding and polymer flooding were significantly less (about half in our case) when compressibility was 5.6 <U+00D7> 10-4 psi-1 than when compressibility was 1 <U+00D7> 10-6 psi-1—simply because the oil recovery target was less. For the many waterflooding and polymer flooding cases, most incremental oil was recovered within five years of starting injection—regardless of formation compressibility. Water cuts rose to high values within five years of injection, regardless of the viscosity of the injected fluid and the compressibility value. Consistent with the actual field application, the response to polymer injection varied greatly from well to well. However, our analysis indicated that these variations were due to existing heterogeneities within the pattern—not to the high compressibility of the formation. During simulation, polymer injection increased porosity by factors up to 1.5 and permeability by factors up to 2.3. Nevertheless, compaction or dilation had a fairly even (proportionate) effect on porosity and permeability throughout the pattern. If polymer injection was stopped after the simulated peak in porosity was reached (after 4-6 years of injection) and compaction was allowed to resume, a modest level of oil recovery resulted from this second compaction period (25%-38% of the incremental oil during polymer injection). However, substantially longer was required for the recovery (15-17 years versus 4-6 years for polymer flooding). Consequently, relying on re-compaction during this period of low oil prices may not be as profitable as one might hope. Our work suggests that there is an optimum rate, viscosity, and pressure for polymer flooding compressible formations. Flooding too rapidly results in pressures that waste much of the injection energy on dilating the formation—thereby detracting from efficient displacement of the oil. These constraints restrict injection rate, viscosity, and pressure to a greater degree for very compressible formations than for incompressible formations.|","Compressibility, Polymer flooding, EOR, Compaction, Dilation"

Increased development of resource shales near industrial areas is spawning interests in storing CO2 generated from the neighboring industries in depleted organic-rich resource shales. This work presents a compositional model for the flow of a multi-component hydrocarbon gas and CO2 in a deformable porous medium consisting of an inorganic and an organic matrix. The fully-coupled equations for fluid transport and geomechanics are solved using the Control Volume Finite Element Method. 
This work presents a mathematical model for CO2 storage in shales. The model accounts for the dispersed nature of kerogen in shale and can describe the advective and diffusive transport of the hydrocarbon components and CO2. The pressure- dependence of diffusion is modeled using the Maxwell-Stefan model, while desorption of the hydrocarbon species and adsorption of CO2 in kerogen is modeled with the Extended Langmuir Isotherm. The governing equations are solved implicitly for coupled geomechanics and flow. The developed simulator is used to model the primary depletion of a representative Barnett shale-gas reservoir, as well as the storage of CO2 in this depleted reservoir under various conditions. 
The simulation results from this work indicate that the storage capacity of organic-rich shales could be overestimated if we do not account for the pore-volume reduction due to the pore space occupied by the adsorbed gas. During primary recovery from organic-rich shales, the pore-pressure drops and some of the gases adsorbed on the surface of the organic pore walls are produced. This results in an increase in the pore volume available for subsequent CO2 storage. However, the pore-pressure drop also results in an increased effective stress, which could lead to a reduction in fracture conductivity and cumulative production. The model and simulator presented is capable of modeling the relative contributions of these coupled phenomena and the attending effect on CO2 storage.|","Control Volume Finite Element Method, CO2 Sequestration, Maxwell-Stefan Diffusion, Coupled Geomechanics and Flow Simulation, compositional shale gas simulation"

Direct assessment of porosity and permeability in unconventional reservoirs such as shales and tight gas sands using imaging technologies is a challenge because of small pore throats, a broad pore size range, and sample heterogeneities with respect to mineralogy and grain size. This contribution presents the outcome of a range of Liquid Metal Injection (LMI) experiments in which we injected various fusible alloys into unconventional reservoir type of rocks, followed by Broad Ion Beam (BIB) polishing and SEM imaging to visualize and to better understand the pore connectivity and transport mechanisms in these tight rocks. 
In a series of experiments liquid metal was injected into a variety of organic-rich shales and other tight rocks at elevated temperature (approximately 90 °C) by increasing the pressure stepwise, up to a maximum of 500 MPa. Once the desired pressure was reached, the experiment was completed by turning off the heating and letting the samples cool down while maintaining the pressure. After solidification of the alloy, the sample was argon-ion polished to create a smooth surface for SEM imaging. Imaging sister samples on which we applied different intrusion pressures enables insight into how these tight rocks are progressively filled with the alloy. 
Firstly, injection of a non-wetting alloy followed by BIB surface polishing and SEM imaging allows comparison with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry and visualizing which parts of the pore space are filled during intrusion of a liquid metal. SEM enables identifying alloy-filled pores below ten nanometers in size. High-resolution SEM images provide insight in preferred transport pathways and the variability of pore throat sizes. The experiments show that the non-wetting alloy does not intrude into samples in a uniform way. The relatively lowest porous sample investigated displayed the intrusion of alloy only into fractures, interpreted as induced micro-fractures, while others showed alloy within parts of the in-situ pore space. In a Posidonia Shale sample, intruded and non-intruded layers exist within the same sample, while the layers show no significant difference in mineral fabric at the large scale. At higher resolution, porous calcite fossils and framboidal pyrites were mostly filled with the alloys as was the clay-rich matrix. Injection of a sister sample with a more wetting alloy showed uniform intrusion of the alloy throughout the sample in the in-situ pore space and micro-fractures. The segmented SEM images allow quantification of the connected porosity. The question, which of the identified micro-fractures are induced or not, is subject of current research. 
Recent advances in LMI in combination with BIB milling technologies and SEM facilitate imaging connected porosity, both induced and in-situ, down to the nanometer scale in representative 2D cross-sections. Hence, LMI-BIB-SEM is a relatively easy method to verify whether unconventional reservoir samples contain good poro-perm and fracability properties.|","Connected Porosity, BIB-SEM, Liquid Metal Injection, Unconventional Reservoirs, Shale"

Shale gas wells exhibit formation linear flow, which is in most cases the only transient flow regime available for engineering analysis. Production Rate Transient Analysis (RTA) methods have been developed to analyze the transient flow into shale gas well. These methods often assume homogeneous reservoir properties and neglect the dynamic nature of the formation. In shale gas reservoirs, however, the properties could change; in particular, the permeability due to stress-dependence of the formation and non-Darcian effects. In this work, a theoretical study is conducted to show the range of errors on the predicted total fracture surface area caused by the constant permeability assumption. The study proposes a modified RTA model, which accounts for dynamic permeability to eliminate the error in calculated area. 
Results from the sensitivity analysis show that the error on surface area calculation ranges from 1% – 323% due to the constant permeability assumption. The total fracture surface area calculation is most sensitive to the geomechanical (stress-sensitive) parameters, which affect the permeability in the region away from fractures. Results show that the error in area is reduced when the initial value of the dynamic permeability is large. Sorption parameters are the second most influential category affecting the surface area calculation. Molecular diffusion of the adsorbed and free gas molecules enhance permeability near the fractures, wherein the slightest variations in dynamic permeability can cause the error in area to change significantly. For these parameters, higher permeability near the fractures translates to higher error in area.|","Molecular transport, Geomechanics, Fracture surface area, Rate transient analysis, Shale permeability"

Uniform proppant distribution in multiple perforation clusters plays a crucial role on sufficiently propping fractures conductivity in hydraulic fracturing. These propped fractures and their effectiveness is critically influenced by the in situ stress in the formation. As great uncertainty exists in uneven propped fracture, this paper examines the impact of proppant distribution and fracture conductivity variation on the gas productivity for shale gas reservoirs, by developing a reservoir simulation model. 
In this paper, numerical reservoir simulation, which involves application of a constantly decreasing permeability to the propped fracture, are used to model the uneven proppant distribution and geomechanics effect. The decrease of permeability, along from the wellbore toward the tip, is simulated using an exponential approach, as well as a linear approach. Moreover, Effects of gas desorption and stress-dependent fracture conductivity are taken into account in this model. Sensitivity analysis is carried out on critical parameters to quantify the key parameters affecting gas productivity between uniform and nonuniform proppant distribution. The degree of non-uniform proppant distribution is also investigated and divided into four types of proppant distribution scenarios. 
The following conclusions can be obtained based on the simulation results. A big difference on well performance between the case of linear and exponential permeability degradation is observed. The pressure distribution comparison shows higher pressure drops in the exponentially decreasing permeability case, which results in a lower gas production. Reservoir permeability plays a critical role in cumulative gas production, no matter in case of permeability exponentially degrading or linear degrading, followed by fracture half-length, primary fracture conductivity, Fracture complexity, permeability anisotropy. Furthermore, the effect of uneven proppant distribution between different clusters can significantly reduce the gas recovery, especially in low proppant concentration and small fracture conductivity. 
The model presented in this paper takes the uneven proppant distribution and geomechanics effect into consideration and shows good agreement with real field production. This paper can demonstrate its own merits on the optimization of hydraulic fracturing treatments, and provide a better understanding of the effect of proppant distribution on well performance.|","Proppant distribution, Non-uniform degree, Shale gas, Characterization, Sensitivity study"

Molecular diffusion plays an important role in shale oil recovery. CO2 huff-n-puff is a feasible way to recover shale oil in multistage fractured horizontal wells, and natural fracture is important during this process. In this work, the CMG-GEM model is built based on the Bakken formation geological settings and the Bakken live oil PVT data, in which natural fracture effective permeability is populated with a series of Dykstra-Parsons (DP) coefficients and spatial correlation lengths. DP coefficient varies from 0.396 to 0.867, and correlation length varies from 50 ft to 3,000 ft. CO2 huff-n-puff starts when primary recovery factor reaches 3%, in either single-cycle or multiple-cycle schemes: single-cycle is set with a fixed injected CO2 reservoir pore volume, and multiple-cycle is set with fixed huff/soak/puff days. Findings in this work highlight the complex molecular diffusion behavior in the comprehensive field-scale simulations. The findings imply the importance of accurate in-lab diffusion coefficient measurement between CO2 and light oil components.

Plug and Perf (PnP) has been predominant for years as the preferred completion method for unconventional reservoirs. However this technique can be costly and time consuming. The Coiled Tubing Activated Frac Sleeves (CTAFS) technique utilizes fracture sleeves that can be hydraulically opened using coiled tubing and fractured through the annuls, minimizing time between stages and reducing total fluid consumption. 
This paper evaluates the fracturing and production performance of the Plug and Perf technique compared to Coiled Tubing Activated Fracture Sleeves (CTAFS) in a US shale oil play (Eagle Ford) and in tight sand reservoirs (Cotton Valley, Bone Spring and Granite Wash). 
It focuses on a strategy of improving ultimate recovery by using fracturing modeling, proper completion selection and field data to determine the optimal stage spacing of the multistage completion systems (PnP and CTAFS). The fracture models were created using existing logs and geomechanical modeling results in the surrounding area to create an optimal geometric spacing for the stages. The basics of the primary multistage completion systems are discussed and briefly compared from an operations point of view. Effective fracture dimensions can be achieved by selecting better locations for the stage clusters in Plug ad Perf and single fracture injection points using Coiled Tubing Activated Frac Sleeves (CTAFS). Fracture treatment schedules for each completion technique are recommended in terms of proppant type, concentration, fracture fluid type and volume. 
Two different fracture treatments were used to analyze the effect of fracturing fluid and completion type on fracture geometry. Coiled Tubing Activated Frac Sleeves with an optimized fracture treatment schedule outperformed the PnP as it fully controls fracture placement, leading to bigger drainage areas. For PnP, cumulative production decreased with an increasing number of clusters and the less efficiency of the stages on productivity. Adding more sleeves accelerated the EUR because of a larger drainage area. The CTAFS technique allowed tighter spacing of frac stages and ensured that the fracture was created at the sleeve in contrast to PnP technique in which some zones could remain untreated.|","Coiled Tubing Activated Fracture Sleeves, Fracture Modeling, Hydraulic Fracturing, Plug and Perf, Production Enhancement"

The variation of temperature profile of the sandface and wellbore offers important indicators for the occurrence of various downhole phenomena, as functions of reservoir formation and fluid properties. This paper aims to investigate the assimilation of temperature and production data for robust and efficient estimation of reservoir formation properties and fluid characterization. Very few previous work in the literature used Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) data for the characterization of the reservoir fluid and geostatistical description. The main contribution of this work lies in the proposed methodology for integration of temperature data from DTS systems to obtain a robust estimation of the reservoir fluid description, as well as introducing the integration of temperature data as an alternative and/or complementary data for integrative reservoir characterization. Two synthetic reservoir examples are investigated. In the first example, we focus on resolving the geostatistical description of a 3D multi-phase reservoir under water flooding. An ensemble-based data assimilation algorithm is used to compare the characterization of reservoir formation porosity and permeability by integration of temperature profile and well production data as opposed to the integration of production logging tool (PLT) data. Our results show that the DTS temperature data shows good potential as an alternative to the PLT data for reservoir rock characterization, although there may be a risk of model overfitting due to the large amount of data. In the second example, we attempt to estimate the original composition of the reservoir fluid as well as reservoir rock properties using downhole temperature profile data. A relatively simple multi-layer radial reservoir model is considered in this case. However, in order to honor the physical bounds on the various model parameters, a constrained ensemble-based data assimilation algorithm based on Lagrange multipliers is adopted. The computational results show that the original reservoir fluid composition could be excellently estimated for a case with known reservoir properties. Presence of uncertainty in the reservoir formation properties resulted in an poor estimation of the original reservoir fluid composition.|","Inequality Constraints, Distributed Temperature Sensing Data, Data Assimilation, Reservoir Characterization"

The tight gas is one of the main types of the unconventional gas. Typically the tight gas reservoirs consist of highly heterogeneous low permeability reservoir. The economic evaluation for the production from tight gas production is very challenging task because of prevailing uncertainties associated with key reservoir properties, such as porosity, permeability as well as drainage boundary. However one of the important parameters requiring in this economic evaluation is the equivalent drainage area of the well, which relates the actual volume of fluids (e.g gas) produced or withdrawn from the reservoir at a certain moment that changes with time. It is difficult to predict this equivalent drainage area of well in tight gas reservoir as it takes utterly long time for reservoir pressure to reach to the impermeable physical boundary of the reservoir. The effective drainage area, which grows with time during the transient period; and consequently it is much smaller than the physical drainage arear over the transient flow period in case of tight gas reservoir because of the low permeability. Consequently the production forecasting using physical drainage area (as generally considered for conventional reservoir) can results not only significant error in estimation but also mislead the decision making process. 
In this paper however, a practical method for predicting the equivalent drainage area of a fractured well in tight gas reservoir is proposed. This method is based upon combined gas material balance equation and decline curve analysis. The developed method is validated against reservoir simulation results, which demonstrates that the proposed method is accurate enough to predict the equivalent drainage area, and may be considered as a practical tool for production forecasting for tight gas reservoir. Sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate various factors, such as porosity, permeability, facture length on equivalent drainage area for fractured vertical well in tight gas reservoir. Based on the sensitivity study it is observed that the fracture half-length and the porosity have strong impact on the equivalent drainage area, and propagation of equivalent drainage area with time.|","Tight Gas Reservoirs, Equivalent Drainage Area of Well, Decline Curve Analysis, Material balance equation, Fractured well"

These deep gas development and exploration wells require a dramatic departure from conventional operating envelopes, including pressure, temperature, hydraulics, and formation evaluation capability. This paper discusses unique borehole integrity and formation evaluation challenges in two North Sea HPHT wells. It demonstrates how innovative new technology, coupled with fast-track component design modifications to meet specific operational challenges, enabled the safe, cost-effective drilling of these wells. 
The development of telemetry, gamma ray, pressure-while-drilling (PWD), vibration, and induction resistivity technology that is rated to operate at 200°C / 25,000 psi followed a stringent life cycle process. In this process, the field trial phase of the technology development included a rapid phase of trial runs, followed by engineering improvements. This iterative process helped to ensure that the technology was fit-for-purpose when it reached the commercialization phase. 
The step change in the thermal tolerance of the downhole electronics was accomplished through significant changes in design simplification, thermal screening, ceramic encapsulation, and thermal dissipation modeling relative to existing high-temperature electronics rated to 175 °C.|","environment, well, performance, North Sea, Harsh"

Drilling risk can be migrated based on borehole failure mechanism analysis, which provides valuable information for wellbore stability and formation damage protection. It is very challenging to identify the borehole failure in oilbase mud environment because of lacking of high resolution borehole image although we can get some information from cutting shape or sonic data with high uncertainty. 
A new photorealistic micro-electrical imager for oil-based mud provides rich information on borehole failure and related formation damage from 3 different images (resistivity, permittivity and stand-off). The different borehole failure mode including tensile, compressional or shear are easily identified from resistivity or permittivity image. 
The multiple arm radius data of this imager was also used to for borehole failure identification complementing with image feature interpretation. The special stand-off image was integrated for borehole failure identification as well. 
One case study from Clair field, west of Shetlands North Sea was presented to demonstrate the borehole failure identification. The horizontal incipient breakout in horizontal well provides the consistent extensional stress regime; the breakout from vertical well show the new understanding of minimum horizontal stress and the mixture of drilling induced fracture and incipient breakout indicate the small ratio of two horizontal stress. The one dimensional mechanical earth model (MEM) of a horizontal well was updated based on borehole failure mechanism. The new MEM is more consistent with field leak of testing in other wells and provide valuable information for mud optimization to improve drilling efficiency in different risk intervals. 
The new high-definition OBM-adapted micro-electrical imagesenabled confident identification and quantification of borehole tensile orshear failures and provides direct evidence for single well geomechanics earth model calibration.|","Stand-off image, Micro-electrical image, Borehole failure mechanism, West of Shetland, Incipient breakout"

Inflow Control Devices (ICDs) modify the inflow profile of a multi-zone well completion. Their imposition of an extra pressure drop at the sandface has proven to be particularly effective at delaying the breakthrough of (unwanted) water or gas in wells with long completion lengths. It is widely accepted that an ICD completion improves the field's economics; but the question of whether and why an ICD completion affects the accuracy of standard Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA) workflows has not been addressed. 
A typical ICD completion is designed to create an extra pressure drop of a similar magnitude to the well's expected reservoir drawdown when producing at its target rate. This paper shows why this extra pressure drop cannot always be treated as an additional skin value during PTA. This is because the ICD's pressure drop is a time dependent variable, varying with both fluid's viscosity and flowrate through the device. A nonlinear pressure loss can, sometimes, distort the pressure response and render conventional PTA methods inaccurate. 
The study presented in this paper uses an integrated, dynamically coupled, wellbore and reservoir model to define the limits within which treating the ICD pressure drop as an additional skin is a valid assumption and when its nonlinear nature will result in an inaccurately estimated value of skin and reservoir permeability. A general workflow for the analysis of PTA data measured in liquid producing wells completed with ICDs is proposed for the derivation of realistic values of the formation damage skin. The workflow has also been adapted for routine monitoring of wells completed with ICDs. 
The value of this study is illustrated by its application to two data sets from the North Sea's Golden Eagle field. This is an ideal field to test the validity of our theoretical analysis due to well completions with multiple levels of inflow control together with ""state-of-the-art"", downhole sensors. The results of this work allows Reservoir and Production Engineers to differentiate between deteriorating well performance due to increasing watercut and that due to an increasing formation damage skin.|","Pressure Transient Analysis, Skin, Advanced Wells, Flow Control Devices, Dynamic Modelling"

The objectives of this qualification were to investigate the effects of both high pressure and the presence of mono-ethylene glycol (MEG), under as realistic conditions as possible, on the system performance using crude oil and water. MEG is a gas hydrate inhibitor which will likely be injected in long subsea tie-backs. |The tested compact produced water treatment system consisted of a two-stage de-oiling arrangement in which the first stage was a bulk de-oiler hydrocyclone, and the second stage was a polishing hydrocyclone. Each stage consisted of a pressure vessel which was filled with multiple hydrocyclone liners. For this qualification, Sulzer's MixedFlow De-Oiling Liquid-Liquid Hydrocyclone technology was used. Sulzer hydrocyclones utilize a design with multiple openings in the inlet as well as a swirl generation element, resulting in a stabilizing and coalescing effect on the oil-water flow. The system was tested at a high pressure test loop with crude and methane to provide the most realistic testing conditions. Tests were also performed with MEG in the feed. MEG is required for gas hydrate inhibition, and under some operating conditions MEG can influence de-oiling efficiency during produced water treatment. For this reason, test points with and without MEG present in the feed were included in the test matrix. |The impact of the inlet conditions (temperature, pressure, oil in water (OIW) concentration, e.g.) on the de-oiling system performance was investigated. The system was tested with temperatures as high as 70°C and pressures as high as 51 bar(g). System efficiencies approaching 99% were found for many cases and pressure drop was measured to be significantly less than that which is expected of similar de-oiling systems.

The relevance and applicability of more recent class notations such as ""Ship Shaped Unit"" are still being investigated and analyzed. This could allow for more relevant and typical vessel like criteria to be applied to the platform when transiting to and from shore and between turbines but then allows for MODU like notations to remain when gangway connected or operating on station and in Dynamic Positioning (DP) mode. HAZID workshops are highly recommended for novel concepts such as this to identify and eliminate ""show stoppers"" during initial design stages. Time spent undertaking such reviews at this stage pay for themselves in a reduction in design rework during class, functional and production design stages. |The relatively immature and rapidly evolving nature of this industry sector leads to many challenges for all involved and the willingness and cooperation that classification societies play during early stage designs to provide the necessary guidance to safely meet the developing market segments is critical.

However, the modern trend towards deeper waters and heavier structures is currently challenging traditional approaches to foundation design, especially in presence of particularly poor soil conditions. The intrinsic conservatism carried by design codes may not only lead to higher fabrication/installation costs, but also conflict with the operational limits of existing installation vessels. |Based on the analysis of four design cases, it is argued that ISO/API safety factors may be from 1.5 to 2.3 times as low as the predictions of elastoplastic finite element (FE) simulations. Such a conservatism is also found to considerably increase with the embedment depth, whereas the influence of the foundation aspect ratio is nearly negligible.

This is because pipelines and spools have their centers of mass very close to the ground level. However, when the pipelines/spools are supported on, or connected to different structures (platform, subsea isolation skids, PLETs, etc.), the impact of the differential movements of these supports and structures on the pipeline and spools response should be considered. |The industry approach to the seismic design of a subsea pipeline system is that the system is designed for Extreme Level Earthquake (ELE) and is able to withstand Abnormal Level Earthquake (ALE) with some damage, but not loss of containment. The design of a pipeline system is iterative by nature. The pipeline loads on the subsea structure are input to the subsea structure design, while the subsea structure foundation resistance is an input to the pipeline integrity checks. Hence, an integrated model incorporating the pipeline, tie-in spools and subsea structures is the most comprehensive design method. |Pipeline systems are typically analyzed for seismic loadings by the modal response spectrum method, or time history analysis. The modal response spectrum method is a linear method and is not adequate when non-linearity should be considered (e.g. ALE). It is desirable that the designer should make every effort to ensure that the ALE is a confirmatory check, which should not lead to major adjustments in the design. To achieve this vision, the designer should use ductile material and the design should have sufficient flexibility; meaning that the system should be able to undergo large deformations without loss of containment. In essence, a time history method should be adopted. However, it is not often economical or a trivial task to perform such analysis in the early phases of the project definition (i.e. concept selection or pre-FEED) or even during the FEED phase. |Taking a case study, the application of different seismic analysis approaches to a pipeline system, including pipelines, tie-in spools, and subsea structures, is presented and evaluated.

The global response of the pipeline can be critically affected by the resistance provided by the seabed. Accurate modeling of pipe-soil interaction behavior leads to improved reliability and can lead to design optimizations that offer considerable cost benefits. |Extensive recent research and advances in design approaches, particularly through the development of high pressure high temperature lines, has led to significant revisions and improvements to pipe-soil interaction modeling over the past decade. There are now well-established techniques for estimating the as-laid embedment and axial and lateral pipe-soil interaction responses – the non-linear ‘springs’ used in pipeline structural modelling – for pipelines laid on the seabed. However, these methods, as applied in practice, generally involve the key assumption that the pipe exerts a vertical force on the seabed, V equal to its submerged self-weight, W – the ‘V=W assumption’. However, this assumption is not appropriate for pipe elements that are close to points of fixity, constraint or vertical upsets – e.g. in-line tees, buckle initiators and sand waves – or which form spools. |This paper illustrates examples of all of these situations, showing pipe-soil interaction ‘springs’ generated with and without the ‘V=W assumption’, to show the contrasting behavior. Recommendations are provided for practical modeling of this soil-structure interaction behavior. |In some design scenarios, the pipeline may be sufficiently robust that adoption of the ‘V=W assumption’ may not affect the integrity of the design. In other scenarios, it may be necessary to eliminate the ‘V=W assumption’ in order for a satisfactory design to be demonstrated. This may be achieved by performing integrated soil-structure interaction analyses, or through iterative refinement of the pipe-soil ‘springs’. In all cases, an awareness of the ‘V=W assumption’ is required across the pipeline engineering and geotechnical teams, who should interact to determine the appropriate basis to demonstrate an acceptable design.|","Pipelines, Geotechnical engineering, Soil-structure interaction"

Since the late 1990s, major programs of research work have been undertaken to develop appropriate models for pipe-soil interaction for seabed pipelines in challenging environments and operating at high temperature and pressure, to mitigate design issues associated with geohazards, hydrodynamic stability and thermal expansion management. Project-specific programs of work have been extended into industry-wide Joint Industry Projects, and operating pipelines are now providing field observations to validate and refine the design analyses. Much of this new knowledge is now maturing into best practices that can be presented in codes and standards. This paper synthesises that work, and provides recommendations of methodologies suited to codification that will guide future projects. |The paper has been authored by a team of practitioners and researchers that comprise a Technical Panel working under the API/ISO geotechnical committee, and the paper sets out some of our views on future additions to the API/ISO codes. |Recent advances in the treatment of pipe-soil interaction in pipeline design cover a range of aspects, including (i) quantifying subaqeous flow (submarine slide) geohazards - slide runout behaviour, pipeline impact loads and pipe deformation, (ii) predicting pipeline embedment, including the effects of the lay process, and through-life changes due to sediment transport, (iii) modelling axial pipe-soil interaction, including the strong influence of drainage and consolidation on soft soils, (iv) modelling lateral pipe-soil interaction, including cyclic effects such as the growth of soil berms beside the pipe, (v) modelling scour and self-burial, in regions of hydrodynamic activity, and the resulting changes in pipeline stability. |Many of these effects are complex, involving temporal changes in seabed bathymetry and soil strength. However, they can also offer significant design efficiencies, providing a motivation to capture them accurately. For example, self-burial of a pipeline through seabed mobility may lead to an improvement in stability that reduces the requirement for weight coating or secondary stabilization works. Also, long-term changes in seabed friction due to consolidation following each cycle of expansion and contraction may lead to a progressive stabilization, reducing the need for anchoring. This paper includes examples where it has been possible for methods emerging from research to be applied in practical design, validated by observations from the laboratory or from operating pipelines. |Many aspects of modern methods for pipe-soil interaction analysis are reaching a level of maturity that allows a consensus to be reached on best practices for design.

Conventional surface solutions result in large facilities that are heavy and costly. Subsea solutions are challenged when confronted with long distance tie-backs. While the FLNG option initially looked promising, high CAPEX and very high OPEX have limited its potential application, with four potential FLNG projects being cancelled in Australasia in the last two years. |A revolutionary new solution, a proprietary ‘Hybrid Concept’ has emerged to solve this grand challenge of developing deepwater gas fields. It is not surface, not subsea, but the ultimate combination of both, offering fundamentally more efficient and hence lower cost processing. |The concept incorporates several principals that have been overlooked to date, namely:-   |Fundamental differences in cost between surface liquids and surface gas processing |There is a key distinction and granularity between the costs for surface processing of liquids and surface processing of gas. Liquids can be processed on the surface relatively efficiently. It is the high pressure surface gas systems that have a disproportionate impact on size, weight and cost of surface facilities.  |Fundamental Processing differences for liquids and gas |Cold temperatures are required for gas processing and this is efficiently found near the seabed. In contrast, liquids processing requires heat both to efficiently separate and stabilise the components.   |Subsea Dehydration |Dehydration is the core unit operation to allow long distance pipeline transfer by preventing hydrates and corrosion. Dehydration has been almost universally applied to onshore and fixed platform processing facilities, thus allowing dry, single phase pipeline transfer. |Existing subsea gas developments rely on either adding chemicals or heat and insulation to avoid hydrate formation and reduce corrosion. While successful across short to medium distances, across longer distances and in deeper waters these methods prove far less efficient and much more costly.  |The Hybrid Concept fully processes the high pressure gas on the seabed in two stages. The first stage includes active cooling and bulk water separation and removal. In the second stage, the gas is processed with liquids removed to achieve full subsea dehydration. All liquids are directed to a simple and compact, low pressure surface unit. This surface unit provides support to the subsea processing, reducing complexity, costs and project risk. |The result is significantly lower development CAPEX and lower OPEX, with a minimum of complexity, giving an acceptable project risk. Importantly all components are proven and require a minimum of technical development. Safety is significantly improved with no high pressure gas on the surface and a significantly reduced permanent offshore workforce required. |The details of this concept, along with its significant advantages are discussed in this paper.|","subsea processing, FLNG alternative, subsea dehydration, Gas development, Hybrid Concept"

Favorable results have been attributed to intersection and reactivation of pre-existing fractures by hydraulically-induced fractures that connect the wellbore to a larger fracture surface area within the reservoir rock volume. Thus, accurate estimation of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) becomes critical for the reservoir performance simulation and production analysis. Micro-seismic events (MS) have been commonly used as a proxy to map out the SRV geometry, which could be erroneous because not all MS events are related to hydraulic fracture propagation. The case studies discussed here utilized a fully 3-D simulation approach to estimate the SRV. |The simulation approach presented in this paper takes into account the real-time changes in the reservoir's geomechanics as a function of fluid pressures. It is consisted of four separate coupled modules: geomechanics, hydrodynamics, a geomechanical joint model for interfacial resolution, and an adaptive re-meshing. Reservoir stress condition, rock mechanical properties, and injected fluid pressure dictate how fracture elements could open or slide. Critical stress intensity factor was used as a fracture criterion governing the generation of new fractures or propagation of existing fractures and their directions. Our simulations were run on a Cray XC-40 HPC system. |The studies outcomes proved the approach of using MS data as a proxy for SRV to be significantly flawed. Many of the observed stimulated natural fractures are stress related and very few that are closer to the injection field are connected. The situation is worsened in a highly laminated shale reservoir as the hydraulic fracture propagation is significantly hampered. High contrast in the in-situ stresses related strike-slip developed thereby shortens the extent of SRV. However, far field nature fractures that were not connected to hydraulic fracture were observed being stimulated. |These results show the beginning of new understanding into the physical mechanisms responsible for greater disparity in stimulation results within the same shale reservoir and hence the SRV. Using the appropriate methodology, stimulation design can be controlled to optimize the responses of in-situ stresses and reservoir rock itself.|","Document Type

The main objective was to provide safe mud weight ranges and predict possible problematic depths to minimize drilling challenges like pack-off, stuck-pipe, lost in hole, over-pulls etc., which are likely due to wellbore instability. The scope of this work was restricted to the curve section of the planned wells because most of the problematic formations, comprising mainly shale and weak interbedded sand formations, are encountered in the curve section. |The operator's drilling department sought a clear understanding of the geomechanical aspects of these problematic formations to optimize the drilling plan and minimize nonproductive time. A 1D mechanical earth model (MEM) was constructed using openhole log data available from the only exploratory well drilled on this platform. The 1D MEM was further used in conducting post-drilling analyses to validate and history match events related to wellbore instability (like tight spots, pack-off etc.,) that were observed while drilling and stress-related wellbore failure as shown by the calipers. |The developed model was used for analyzing planned well trajectories and providing mud weight window limits to safely drill the highly deviated planned wells. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the well inclination limits to drill across the problematic zones whilst minimizing issues related to wellbore instability. The developed geomechanical model was validated using the log data acquired during drilling each of these inclined wells; the predictions from the model were in close agreement with actual observations during drilling. |The outcome of this study helped optimize the well design for upcoming wells in this field. Using the recommendations provided from this study, several highly deviated development wells were successfully drilled and completed.

The trials with two fields show encouraging results. In strike-slip enviroments, superposition of local stresses cause by structural deformation and the regional Paleo-stresses assisted to predict the strike and risk zones for fold-related fractures successfully. |The main challenge is estimation of paleo-stress orientation and magnitudes.  For this is necessary to have at least one field in a region with actual fracture measurements and models from borehole image logs and production data.  The predicted fracture models for different paleo-stress orientation and direction are calibrated to the actual observed fracture models to estimate the prevailing Paleo-stress at the time of deformation. |For structures which are composite product of multiple pulses of deformation, it is possible to predict fracturing at each phase by using the isochore maps and the latest phase by using the structural grids of the youngest deformed horizon. This requires a detailed tectonic evolution of the structure which must always be the first step in predictive fracture modeling. An understanding of the nature of structure, tectonic regimes that prevailed and timing and origin of tectonic pulses and folding in relation to the regional faulting are essential for predictive fracture modeling. |Predicted risk zones are not only useful in developing new fields for planning but also in mature fields with a descriptive fracture model. Often, the descriptive fracture model displays only what has been intersected in well bores and the fracture model may not capture the essence of fracturing tendencies, and miss risk zones completely. Predicted modeling accompanied with an understanding of the tectonic evolution and structural geology may add invaluable insight and support to descriptive fracture modeling.|",""

Other methods, such as traditional well-testing, numerical reservoir simulation, and decline curve analysis, have inherent limitations or require significant time and effort expended. ANN methodology has the ability to recognize patterns between various parameters in the presence of large databases and is a powerful tool especially when the existing relationships between the dependent and independent parameters are vague or are not well understood. Thus, it is capable of instantly solving problems that do not have known analytical or numerical solutions. CW are scarce in shale gas reservoirs, thus utilizing real data in ANN training is not possible most of the time. Accordingly, numerical reservoir simulation is used to generate the database necessary for training the expert system. |The expert system developed in this research instantly and accurately performs the tasks below for shale gas CW operating under constant bottom-hole pressure conditions and they are capable of: |Predicting production rates for a given CW design from a given shale gas reservoir. |Proposing a robust CW design capable of producing a given production profile from a given set of reservoir properties. |Predicting unconventional reservoir rock properties corresponding to a given gas production profile from a given CW design. |In addition, results prove that a well-trained ANN is capable of making instantaneous and accurate predictions.

Better estimates of UCS could increase the efficiency of drilling and stimulation operations. Current techniques for UCS determination either rely on laboratory measurements or empirical relationships using well logs. The laboratory measurements, although more reliable, are expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, the empirical relations derived from core data and well logs are very unique because they are developed for a specific rock type; hence has limited applications. This paper presents a data-driven model for UCS prediction from petrophysical properties and elemental spectroscopy using artificial intelligent technique, namely support-vector regression (SVR). |Elemental spectroscopy, density, porosity, and UCS data presented in this paper are based on various geological formations. UCS is determined by the uniaxial compression test in the laboratory, while elemental spectroscopy was obtained from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. We first use SVR to establish a correlation between elemental spectroscopy, density, and porosity with UCS. We separate these data into two categories: training and testing data. Training data is used to train SVR and establishes the UCS prediction model. The model will generate UCS prediction using testing data and compared with the laboratory-measured UCS. |In total, 21 cases were run with different combination of input parameters. Good agreement was observed between the SVR-predicted UCS and the laboratory measurement. Two quantitative measures for estimation accuracy are calculated and examined including the coefficient of determination and the mean absolute percentage error. Considering limited number of available data used in this study, the SVR-predicted UCS produces very good coefficient of determination and small error. The results also demonstrate the significant influence of elemental spectroscopy on the UCS prediction because elements determine grain density, which contributes to the rock strength. This emphasizes the advantage of incorporating elemental spectroscopy, together with other petrophysical properties, for UCS prediction. The favorable results in this study demonstrate the promising capability of SVR to build a UCS-prediction model based on elemental spectroscopy and petrophysical properties. Further application of SVR can be adapted to predict UCS directly from mineralogy logs and conventional well logs.|",""

Software tools exist to model all aspects of ICD, reservoir, well and surface facilities. The challenge addressed by this paper is to provide an understanding of the implications for optimal ICD design over the life of the field, by integrating these models in a consistent manner. |This paper investigates different aspects of detailed ICD design on horizontal producers, using a wellcentric reservoir model. The ICD designs from the well-centric models were then applied to a full field reservoir model and integrated studies were then completed. This was achieved by linking several existing software to study the interaction between the ICD design, full field reservoir, well and surface network. Various aspects of the integration of these models were simulated including: artificial lift, water injection strategy and surface network. |Predictably, well-centric simulations showed that ICD designs are dependent on the objective function that is being maximized. If NPV is to be optimized, designing ICD strength to have higher production from the heel and toe regions of the well may produce better results than attempting to equalize the inflow for the entire well. |Integrated studies showed that artificial lift can be beneficial in combination with ICDs, as the ICDs redistributed the fluid influx into the well, yet the liquid rate reduction due to the additional pressure drop from the ICDs was mitigated. Even when ICDs were shown to be beneficial on standalone reservoir/well models, the design and predicted benefit when a surface network is coupled depends on: how the surface network is operated, surface network constraints and the relative water cut of the well which ICDs are applied to in comparison to the other wells in the field.

This pore-pressure estimation method (termed DEMSE) is based on the theory that energy spent at the bit to remove a volume of rock is a function of in-situ rock strength and the differential pressure that the rock is subjected to during drilling. |A work flow is provided that illustrates the steps required to estimate pore pressure from drilling parameters and rock-mechanics data by use of the DEMSE method.

A geomechanical approach was implemented to evaluate the interaction between stress field and the mechanical properties of rocks. A 1-D Mechanical Earth Model (MEM) was built and calibrated with offset wells in the nearby area. The overburden pressure was calculated by integrating density logs from the offset wells. The minimum horizontal stress was calibrated using closure pressure derived from the offset fracture analysis carried out in the offset wells. The rock elastic properties were calibrated with lab test data from an offset well locate ~2 km away from Well_A. |Two case studies will be presented in this paper. The first case is Well_A drilled in a Devonian clastic reservoir, this vertical gas well was perforated with 60 degrees phasing guns. The well had a good performance during the flow back but the production was short-lived due to significant sand production. The second case is a blind test to validate the robustness of the methodology used in the first case study.

It is extremely difficult to fix once it has occurred since limited remedial options are available with marginal success rates. Its causes are easy to understand yet it needs careful planning to prevent it. Post-cementing shallow water flow and gas migration may occur due to several collective causes such as poor fluid displacement efficiencies, losses prior/post or during cement placement, and/or underperforming slurry properties. |Previously proposed solutions focus only on one of these challenges with various success rate depending on well conditions. Addressing all these challenges together is essential for successful prevention. Due to the nature of these wells containing the high probability of flow from these shallow hazards, the clearances between pore and fracture pressures are narrow. This makes the common mud removal approach of displacement mechanics challenging. It also requires a delicate balance between maintaining sufficient hydrostatic to remain above the pore pressure of the flow zone and losing to the weak formations.

Dynamic constants are obtained using ultrasonic techniques and static constants are obtained from the stress-strain response of the rock; both techniques can be used at elevated pressures and temperatures. These methods typically involve the use of cylindrical plugs; however, the existence of natural fractures or fissility of shale formations precludes the extraction of cores. The challenge is to improve reservoir characterization by measuring elastic properties using irregular, but ubiquitous smaller rock samples. We propose measuring two elastic parameters, i.e., Young’s modulus and bulk modulus through nanoindentation and mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) experiments, respectively. With these two constants and the assumption of isotropy, all other isotropic elastic constants can be derived. The idea is to infer Young’s modulus (Enano) using nanoindentation and estimate bulk modulus (KMICP) using MICP data; neither measurement requires core plugs and can be carried out on irregularly shaped rock fragments. We assume the fragments are representative of the formation of interest; confirmation comes from establishing statistics. We measured Woodford, Haynesville, Eagle Ford, Wolfcamp, Bakken, Utica and Green River shale core samples. These values are compared to values obtained in ultrasonic-pulse transmission experiments. Ultrasonic values of K measured at 5,000 psi confining pressure agree well with the values of KMICP at 5,000 psi. Similarly, Enano shows a 1:1 correlation with ultrasonically derived Young’s modulus at 5,000 psi confining pressure. At a confining pressure of 5,000 psi, the influence of cracks is reduced. |INTRODUCTION |The ubiquitous use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate unconventional reservoirs drives the need for improved methodologies to compute the mechanical properties of rock.

Ductility is a function of mineralogy, TOC richness and in-situ stress profile. Within a stimulation zone, where principle stresses are minimally varied, mineralogical variability directly affects elastic properties (Al-Tahini et al., 2006), brittleness and ductility (Bai, 2016): High concentrations of clay make shale more ductile, while the predominance of quartz is associated with brittleness.

Unfortunately, the use of fast drilling motors combined with delayed logging tools, and insufficient data to quantify mechanical properties while drilling created multiple geosteering challenges. This paper describes a new technology that uses surface drilling data to estimate, in real time, the geomechanical properties needed to guide the steering of horizontal wells into the most fracable rock. |The Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) computed from commonly available drilling data such as torque, rate of penetration and weight on bit has been widely used to improve drilling efficiency. However, the more recent use of MSE for completion optimization has yielded conflicting results. This paper introduces the use of Corrected Mechanical Specific Energy (CMSE) where the friction losses along the drill string and wellbore are computed and accounted for in real time. CMSE is used to estimate, in real time, geomechanical logs and build a live geomechanical model that is used for steering into the most fracable rock. Once the drilling is completed, the frac stage spacing and cluster density is adjusted according to CMSE outputs which include pore pressure, stresses, and natural fracture index. |The new approach was used on multiple shale wells where the geomechanical logs predicted from CMSE and subsequently estimated fracture index were validated with multiple data including image logs, microseismic, and elastic properties derived from seismic pre-stack elastic inversion. |This technology represents a major step in completion optimization since it tackles the problem and provides the solution during the drilling phase. A major advantage of the new technology is its ability to be deployed on any rig without the use of additional surface gauges, sensors or downhole measurement tools, avoiding additional costs and risks of potential wellbore problems. Additional benefits of the technology include: no on-site personnel or permits, the use of existing real time drilling data streaming services to quickly steer in the fracable rock, and having completion design immediately following the completion of drilling.

Minimizing the uncertainty in production forecasting and reservoir simulation necessitates an accurate model, which captures the interaction of induced hydraulic fractures with existing natural fractures. One method to achieve this is by using a 3G workflow, which leverages the synthesis of geophysical and geological information through geomechanical techniques to model the hydraulic fracturing of unconventional reservoirs. |A complete workflow is presented for modeling and simulation of unconventional reservoirs, which incorporates the characterization of natural fractures and their interaction with hydraulic fracture stimulation. The 3G workflow is applied to an unconventional well in the Wolfcamp Shale, Permian Basin. The geomechanical modeling results are exported to a standard commercial numerical reservoir simulator using two different approaches; strain volume and constrained asymmetric hydraulic fractures. A third reservoir simulation case is created in which commonly used symmetric hydraulic fractures are generated without any external geomechanical model. An automated history matching tool is used to find the hydraulic fracture parameters for this over simplistic and unrealistic case.

Using sparse information, the algorithm was able to automatically design entire well paths in a relatively short period for all cases and the final solutions resembled industry solutions based on minimum design constraint. The uniqueness of the work is highlighted by the algorithm's ability to converge towards optimal solutions which can help the operator shift work load from well design to more critical tasks. |Introduction |Due to a challenging commodity price environment, engineers and firms must utilize technology to develop low-cost solutions to automate complex tasks and allow for better use of resources. The optimal well path algorithm outlined in this paper attempts to close the cost and technology gap by providing a solution which generates solutions automatically. The primary goal of well path optimization is to obtain the best well path that can maximize recoveries while minimizing risk, cost, and time needed to drill a well. Planning a well path depends on a number of factors and restrictions. Safety is the one of the important factors to be considered while drilling. Obstructions, such as fault lines, should be well identified and characterized to avoid drilling through them. Depleted zones should be well studied and described as they may lead to significant problems while drilling such as mud loss and abnormality in formation facture gradient (Zoback 2010).|",""

For instance, the percentage sonic anisotropy in the formation provides vital knowledge when constructing Geomechanics mechanical models and when determining optimum well trajectory for horizontal wells. One of the main outputs from sonic anisotropy processing is the fast shear-wave polarization azimuth (FSA) derived from auxiliary tool orientation measurements included in the tool string with the sonic tools. This FSA is polarized along the direction of fracture strike, in case of fracture-induced anisotropic zones, and /or along maximum horizontal stress, in case of stress-induced anisotropic zones. |When the hole shape is oval in one axis by breakouts and in gauge in the other axis, the sonic tool remains oriented in one direction throughout logging intervals. As a result, the fast shear azimuth will be stable in one direction. This locked direction inherently has a 90° ambiguity if interpreted wrongly particularly if no borehole image data were available to validate this direction from the strike fractures or breakout directions. |The main objective of the study in this paper is to validate the direction of FSA, and then horizontal stress orientations, from sonic data in vertical wells when the sonic tool keeps a singular orientation throughout the logging and no borehole image data are available to support the direction of horizontal stress orientations. This validation is represented through a graphical interpretation of the FSA, both qualitatively and quantitatively, at intervals that exhibit stress-induced anisotropy and without assist from borehole image interpretations. |Three examples are presented in this paper. The first one shows a determining of the maximum horizontal stress from the graphical interpretation of FSA after processing the sonic data. This interpretation is validated with image data. The other two examples are from wells where only sonic data is used to determine the horizontal stress orientations using the FSA graphical technique|","Document Type

Because of the extensive reservoir formation types, fracturing scenarios widely vary from conventional to unconventional cases. Fracturing is one of the few options for commercial hydrocarbon production in some extremely tight reservoirs. Unfortunately, many of the tight formation scenarios achieve fracture inititation and/or extension only under extremely high pressure, thus frequently reaching mechanical forces close to the well completion limitations. Among the different techniques used, the controlled breakdown technique (CBT) helped significantly improve pump rates in some fracture initiation and injection conditions. This technique controls pressure, while considering the completion's mechanical limits. This paper discusses the process and appropriate conditions for CBT application and evaluates when it is convenient or even crucial to help enhance fracture initiation and development. |Introduction |Different techniques are applied during current applications to decrease the fracture initiation and fracture propagation pressures. These techniques include perforation stage design, which uses double-perforating or alternate techniques for reservoir contact, and unconventional fracture initiation methods that can involve chemical reactions that are still under development. Because of challenging tight formation scenarios, propped fracture placement is crucial for production enhancement. In many cases, just achieving injection can be a significant challenge. Even when fracture initiation and injection are possible, operators should also consider the compatibility of the fluids making formation contact and possible restrictions caused by the mechanical capacities of the completion in the wellbore. |In Saudi Arabia, sandstone reservoirs for conventional and unconventional scenarios often present challenging conditions for fracture stimulation. Initial injection itself demonstrated the increase in pressure to proppant fracture more frequently each day. To overcome the new challenging scenario, different techniques were implemented to help enhance “frac fluid-to-reservoir” contact during fracture initiation. This included openhole completion, underbalanced drilling implementation of multistage fracturing hardware, etc. An increase in fracture initiation pressure for certain areas was observed. This was not exclusive to unconventional reservoirs. It also occurred in tight sections of conventional reservoirs and close to reservoir faults or edges, which can increase local stress and even rotation of the in-situ stress. Average fracture gradients that vary from 0.72 to 0.96 psi/ft are common in conventional reservoirs, but tight or compacted zones can reach up to 1.1 psi/ft and even higher. For such fracture gradients, an initial breakdown pressure of more than 17,000 psi has been observed.|","Document Type

Oil-based muds (OBMs) present an even greater challenge when compared with water-based muds (WBMs) to avoid gas-in-riser events, because the gas dissolves in the mud and may not be detected until it breaks out inside the riser near the surface. |A study with a dynamic multiphase-flow software simulated a rapid unloading event and determined the gas fraction in the riser annulus and the effect on riser-fluid levels. New procedures, such as shutting in the riser or proactively applying surface pressure, were simulated to evaluate the effectiveness of riser-top equipment to mitigate risks of rapid riser unloading. The effects of gas volume and mud type (WBM vs. OBM) on water hammer and riser top pressure during the shut-in were analyzed with a simulated case with a riser in 8,000 ft of seawater. |The analysis shows there is no significant pressure increase at the moment of rapid unloading in a shut-in well. The reliability of the simulation results is verified with a field test conducted at 1,200-ft water depth. The simulation results show it is possible to safely manage gas-in-riser events for large gas fractions with available managed-pressure-drilling (MPD) and riser-gas-handling equipment. |It should be possible to safely and efficiently manage events involving even relatively large gas influxes in risers by use of new proposed procedures, which mitigate the rapid unloading and can help industry develop new guidelines for deepwater-drilling operations.|","Gas-in-Riser, Deepwater Drilling, Surface Back Pressure, Well Control, Rapid Unloading"

A., Shell| Kruijs, E., Shell| Huckabee, P. T., Shell| Stephenson, B. J., Shell| Scholten, S. O., Shell","|Abstract 
Well spacing is a key factor in the evaluation of pad economics for hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. The drilling at the wrong well spacing leads to either over-capitalization risk or leaving reserves in the ground both resulting in loss of net present value risk. This paper presents data acquisition techniques that aid in well interference identification and quantification. Integrated analysis of data from a well pad in the Vaca Muerta formation, including microseismic, chemical tracers, geochemical fingerprinting, and pressure measurement, indicates both pressure and production communication between the two wells studied. Then a dedicated interference test is designed and analyzed to provide insights on well spacing. The test consists of alternating shut-in periods of the two wells during which pressure and rate are closely monitored. Analytical and modeling work has quantified the degree of interference to be up to 20% on production rates. This interference test is performed between two ‘semi-confined’ wells. Future multi-well pads are planned to understand the production potential of a fully ‘confined’ well and the interference between neighboring wells, to further understand the well spacing and pad economics.|","well spacing, Vaca Muerta, Shale oil reservoir, Interference test, unconventional"
