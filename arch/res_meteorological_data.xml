    <title>Statistical Physics in Meteorology</title>
    <summary>  Various aspects of modern statistical physics and meteorology can be tied
together. The historical importance of the University of Wroclaw in the field
of meteorology is first pointed out. Next, some basic difference about time and
space scales between meteorology and climatology is outlined. The nature and
role of clouds both from a geometric and thermal point of view are recalled.
Recent studies of scaling laws for atmospheric variables are mentioned, like
studies on cirrus ice content, brightness temperature, liquid water path
fluctuations, cloud base height fluctuations, .... Technical time series
analysis approaches based on modern statistical physics considerations are
outlined.

    <title>Segmentation for radar images based on active contour</title>
    <summary>  We exam various geometric active contour methods for radar image
segmentation. Due to special properties of radar images, we propose our new

    <title>Data Mining to Investigate the Meteorological Drivers for Extreme Ground
  Level Ozone Events</title>
    <summary>  This project aims to explore which combinations of meteorological conditions
are associated with extreme ground level ozone conditions. Our approach focuses
only on the tail by optimizing the tail dependence between the ozone response
and functions of meteorological covariates. Since there is a long list of
possible meteorological covariates, the space of possible models cannot be
explored completely. Consequently, we perform data mining within the model
selection context, employing an automated model search procedure. Our study is
unique among extremes applications as optimizing tail dependence has not
previously been attempted, and it presents new challenges, such as requiring a
smooth threshold. We present a simulation study which shows that the method can
detect complicated conditions leading to extreme responses and resists
overfitting. We apply the method to ozone data for Atlanta and Charlotte and
find similar meteorological drivers for these two Southeastern US cities. We
identify several covariates which help to differentiate the meteorological
conditions which lead to extreme ozone levels from those which lead to merely
high levels.

    <title>The relationships between PM2.5 and meteorological factors in China:
  Seasonal and regional variations</title>
    <summary>  The interactions between PM2.5 and meteorological factors play a crucial role
in air pollution analysis. However, previous studies that have researched the
relationships between PM2.5 concentration and meteorological conditions have
been mainly confined to a certain city or district, and the correlation over
the whole of China remains unclear. Whether or not spatial and seasonal
variations exit deserves further research. In this study, the relationships
between PM2.5 concentration and meteorological factors were investigated in 74
major cities in China for a continuous period of 22 months from February 2013
to November 2014, at season, year, city, and regional scales, and the spatial
and seasonal variations were analyzed. The meteorological factors were relative
humidity (RH), temperature (TEM), wind speed (WS), and surface pressure (PS).
We found that spatial and seasonal variations of their relationships with PM2.5
do exist. Spatially, RH is positively correlated with PM2.5 concentration in
North China and Urumqi, but the relationship turns to negative in other areas
of China. WS is negatively correlated with PM2.5 everywhere expect for Hainan
Island. PS has a strong positive relationship with PM2.5 concentration in
Northeast China and Mid-south China, and in other areas the correlation is
weak. Seasonally, the positive correlation between PM2.5 concentration and RH
is stronger in winter and spring. TEM has a negative relationship with PM2.5 in
autumn and the opposite in winter. PS is more positively correlated with PM2.5
in autumn than in other seasons. Our study investigated the relationships
between PM2.5 and meteorological factors in terms of spatial and seasonal
variations, and the conclusions about the relationships between PM2.5 and
meteorological factors are more comprehensive and precise than before.

    <title>Comparison of Uncertainty of Two Precipitation Prediction Models</title>
    <summary>  Meteorological inputs are an important part of subsurface flow and transport
modeling. The choice of source for meteorological data used as inputs has
significant impacts on the results of subsurface flow and transport studies.
One method to obtain the meteorological data required for flow and transport
studies is the use of weather generating models. This paper compares the
difference in performance of two weather generating models at Technical Area 54
of Los Alamos National Lab. Technical Area 54 is contains several waste pits
for low-level radioactive waste and is the site for subsurface flow and
transport studies. This makes the comparison of the performance of the two
weather generators at this site particularly valuable.

    <title>Detailed weather data generator for building simulations</title>
    <summary>  Thermal buildings simulation softwares need meteorological files in thermal
comfort, energetic evaluation studies. Few tools can make significant
meteorological data available such as generated typical year, representative
days, or artificial meteorological database. This paper deals about the
presentation of a new software, RUNEOLE, used to provide weather data in
buildings applications with a method adapted to all kind of climates. RUNEOLE
associates three modules of description, modelling and generation of weather
data. The statistical description of an existing meteorological database makes
typical representative days available and leads to the creation of model
libraries. The generation module leads to the generation of non existing
sequences. This software tends to be usable for the searchers and designers, by
means of interactivity, facilitated use and easy communication. The conceptual
basis of this tool will be exposed and we'll propose two examples of
applications in building physics for tropical humid climates.

    <title>Numerical experiments with assimilation of the mean and unresolved
  meteorological conditions into large-eddy simulation model</title>
    <summary>  Micrometeorology, city comfort, land use management and air quality
monitoring increasingly become important environmental issues. To serve the
needs, meteorology needs to achieve a serious advance in representation and
forecast on micro-scales (meters to 100 km) called meteorological terra
incognita. There is a suitable numerical tool, namely, the large-eddy
simulation modelling (LES) to support the development. However, at present, the
LES is of limited utility for applications. The study addresses two problems.
First, the data assimilation problem on micro-scales is investigated as a
possibility to recover the turbulent fields consistent with the mean
meteorological profiles. Second, the methods to incorporate of the unresolved
surface structures are investigated in a priopi numerical experiments. The
numerical experiments demonstrated that the simplest nudging or Newtonian
relaxation technique for the data assimilation is applicable on the turbulence
scales. It is also shown that the filtering property of the three layers
artificial neural network (ANN) can be used for formulation of the surface
stress from the unresolved surface features.

    <title>The influence of the meteorological forcing data on the reconstructions
  of historical storms in the Black Sea</title>
    <summary>  The present article is a study of the applicability of different sources of
meteorological forcing for the coastal wave and storm surge models, which
provide the operational marine forecasts for the coastal early warning systems
(EWS) and are used for reconstructions of historical storms. The reconstruction
of historical storms is one of the approaches to the natural coastal hazard
vulnerability assessment. We evaluate the importance of the input
meteorological information for the mentioned types of coastal models. For two
well documented historical storms, that caused significant damages along the
Bulgarian coast we simulate the significant wave heights and sea level change,
using SWAN wave model and a storm surge model. The wind and mean sea level
pressure fields, which are used in the present study, are extracted from the
ERA Interim reanalysis of the European Center for Medium range Forecasts
(ECMWF) and from the output of the high resolution limited area numerical
weather prediction model ALADIN. The overall conclusion is that for the
successful historical storms reconstructions ERA Interim and ERA40 reanalysis
are valuable source of meteorological forcing, but due to their limitations in
terms of spatial and temporal resolution, it is recommended to produce a higher
spatial and temporal resolution meteorological fields, using dynamical
downscaling of the reanalyzed data.

    <title>Space-time Trends in U.S. Meteorological Droughts</title>
    <summary>  Understanding droughts in a climate context remains a major challenge. Over
the United States, different choices of observations and metrics have often
produced diametrically opposite insights. This paper focuses on understanding
and characterizing meteorological droughts from station measurements of
precipitation. The Standardized Precipitation Index is computed and analyzed to
obtain drought severity, duration and frequency. Average drought severity
trends are found to be uncertain and data-dependent. Furthermore, the mean and
spatial variance do not show any discernible non-stationary behavior. However,
the spatial coverage of extreme meteorological droughts in the United States
exhibits an increasing trend over nearly all of the last century. Furthermore,
the coverage over the last half decade exceeds that of the dust bowl era.
Previous literature suggests that climate extremes do not necessarily follow
the trends or uncertainties exhibited by the averages. While this possibility
has been suggested for droughts, this paper for the first time clearly
delineates and differentiates the trends in the mean, variability and extremes
of meteorological droughts in the United States, and uncovers the trends in the
spatial coverage of extremes. Multiple data sets, as well as years exhibiting
large, and possibly anomalous, droughts are carefully examined to characterize
trends and uncertainties. Nonlinear dependence among meteorological drought
attributes necessitates the use of copula-based tools from probability theory.
Severity-duration-frequency curves are generated to demonstrate how these
insights may be translated to design and policy.

    <title>Is Weather Chaotic?</title>
    <summary>  The correlation dimension and K2-entropy are estimated from meteorological
time- series. The results lead us to claim that seasonal variability of weather
is under influence of low dimensional dynamics, whereas changes of weather from
day to day are governed by high dimensional system(s). Error-doubling time of
this system is less than 3 days. We suggest that the outstanding feature of the
weather dynamics is deterministic chaos.

    <title>Turbulent helium gas cell as a new paradigm of daily meteorological
  fluctuations?</title>
    <summary>  We compare the spectral properties of long meteorological temperature records
with laboratory measurements in small convection cells. Surprisingly, the
atmospheric boundary layer sampled on a daily scale shares the statistical
properties of temperature fluctuations in small-scale experiments. This fact
can be explained by the hydrodynamical similarity between these seemingly very
different systems. The results suggest that the dynamics of daily temperature
fluctuations is determined by the soft turbulent state of the atmospheric
boundary layer in continental climate.

    <title>Early Pioneers of Telescopic Astronomy in India: G.V.Juggarow and His
  Observatory</title>
    <summary>  G.V.Juggarow was one of the early pioneers of observational astronomy in
India who built his own observatory in 1840 at Vizagapatnam. His legacy was
continued by his son-in-law A.V.Nursing Row till 1892, his daughter till 1894,
Madras Government till 1898, and his grandson till it became inactive in early
1900s. Observations of comets, planetary transits, stellar occultations etc
have been continued along with meteorological observations. Celestial
photography was also started at the observatory. After 1898 the observatory's
activities were re-oriented towards meteorology. The establishment of the
observatory, the personalities involved and the final closing of the
institution are described here.

    <title>Cosmogenic 7Be in ground level air in Rostov-on-Don (Russia) (2001-2011)</title>
    <summary>  The deposition flux of cosmogenic 7Be in the industrial city Rostov-on-Don
(Russia) from 2001 to 2011 has been measured. The variations of annual 7Be
deposition flux appear to be mainly correlated with the number of the
meteorological parameters and solar activity. For the first time correlations
of the volume activity of cosmogenic 7Be with such meteorological parameters as
temperature, precipitation, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity
are identified.

    <title>The virial theorem and planetary atmospheres</title>
    <summary>  We derive a version of the virial theorem that is applicable to diatomic
planetary atmospheres that are in approximate thermal equilibrium at moderate
temperatures and pressures and are sufficiently thin such that the
gravitational acceleration can be considered constant. We contrast a
pedagogically inclined theoretical presentation with the actual measured
properties of air.

    <title>What the collapse of the ensemble Kalman filter tells us about particle
  filters</title>
    <summary>  The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a reliable data assimilation tool for
high-dimensional meteorological problems. On the other hand, the EnKF can be
interpreted as a particle filter, and particle filters collapse in
high-dimensional problems. We explain that these seemingly contradictory
statements offer insights about how particle filters function in certain
high-dimensional problems, and in particular support recent efforts in
meteorology to "localize" particle filters, i.e., to restrict the influence of
an observation to its neighborhood.

    <title>Evaluating probabilistic forecasts with the R package scoringRules</title>
    <summary>  Probabilistic forecasts in the form of probability distributions over future
events have become popular in several fields including meteorology, hydrology,
economics, and demography. In typical applications, many alternative
statistical models and data sources can be used to produce probabilistic
forecasts. Hence, evaluating and selecting among competing methods is an
important task. The scoringRules package for R provides functionality for
comparative evaluation of probabilistic models based on proper scoring rules,
covering a wide range of situations in applied work. This paper discusses
implementation and usage details, presents case studies from meteorology and
economics, and points to the relevant background literature.

    <title>Alternative application for the radiation background in the development
  of the atlas database of atmospheric radiation</title>
    <summary>  Nowadays radiation is one of the variables to be considered in the
environmental forecasting and it is meaningful in the increase of global
warming, together greenhouse effect. The radiation considered by the
meteorological organizations depends on the World Radiometric Reference (WRR),
the World Standard Group (WSG), addressed by the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO). This work is based on the cosmic microwave background, as a
variable to be estimated in order to get information about the incident
radiation in the Earth's atmosphere, as a valuable and meaningful contribution
in the building of the radiation atlas by the (UPME) and (IDEAM). Due to the
fact that the variables considered are ultraviolet and infrared radiation,
ozone column, direct radiation and diffuse radiation, the last two get the
global radiation, and are the only ones to be evaluated by the national
meteorological organizations in the country. The study of the cosmic background
radiation as a research project will provide data which will strengthen the
meteorological information systems in Colombia, supported by the Bayesian
methodology; supporting that cosmic background radiation can contribute
significantly in the increase of the variability of the troposphere,
stratosphere and mesosphere world temperature as a consequence of global
warming.

    <title>Approach to spatial estimation of meteorological droughts in the Coello
  River basin, Colombia</title>
    <summary>  The space-temporal evaluation to characterize meteorological droughts was
based on data accumulated monthly precipitation between 1996-2005 from 20
meteorological stations distributed in the Coello River basin. Data
precipitation was performed preprocessing with data consistency tests to
correct and delete data over- or under estimated. To estimate missing
precipitation data are compared three geostatistical interpolation methods
derived from Kriging, associated with secondary variables such as the Ordinary
Kriging, CoKrigin Ordinary associated with secondary variables of a Digital
Elevation Model and data satellite TRMM. To select the statistical method the
setting of each interpolation was compared with respect to three reference
stations through three quality tests, which were Root Mean Square Error (RMSE),
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). In
this investigation two of three tests favor the Ordinary CoKriging using as a
secondary variable Altitude (COK+DEM). With the interpolated series of
precipitation were evaluated and characterized by drought Standardized
Precipitation Index (SPI) at monthly and quarterly scale, calculating the
parameters of severity, duration, intensity and frequency of droughts. By
mapping are delimited the regions where occur the more negative values of SPI.
In analyzing spacetemporal the months of January, February, July and August are
the driest of the year. In 1997 the meteorological drought greatest damage
occurs in the Coello River basin generally concentrated in the middle and lower
part of the basin, with a maximum intensity of SPI -2,57.

    <title>Effect of the troposphere on surface neutron counter measurements</title>
    <summary>  Surface neutron counter data are often used as a proxy for atmospheric
ionisation from cosmic rays in studies of extraterrestrial effects on climate.
Neutron counter instrumentation was developed in the 1950s and relationships
between neutron counts, ionisation and meteorological conditions were
investigated thoroughly using the techniques available at the time; the
analysis can now be extended using modern data. Whilst surface neutron counts
are shown to be a good proxy for ionisation rate, the usual meteorological
correction applied to surface neutron measurements, using surface atmospheric
pressure, does not completely compensate for tropospheric effects on neutron
data. Residual correlations remain between neutron counts, atmospheric pressure
and geopotential height, obtained from meteorological reanalysis data. These
correlations may be caused by variations in the height and temperature of the
atmospheric layer at ~100hPa. This is where the primary cosmic rays interact
with atmospheric air, producing a cascade of secondary ionising particles.

    <title>Quantum Reality, Complex Numbers and the Meteorological Butterfly Effect</title>
    <summary>  A not-too-technical version of the paper: "A Granular Permutation-based
Representation of Complex Numbers and Quaternions: Elements of a Realistic
Quantum Theory" - Proc. Roy. Soc.A (2004) 460, 1039-1055. The phrase
"meteorological butterfly effect" is introduced to illustrate, not the familiar
loss of predictability in low-dimensional chaos, but the much less familiar and
much more radical paradigm of the finite-time predictability horizon,
associated with upscale transfer of uncertainty in certain multi-scale systems.
This motivates a novel reinterpretation of unit complex numbers (and
quaternions) in terms of a family of self-similar permutation operators. A
realistic deterministic kinematic reformulation of the foundations of quantum
theory is given using this reinterpretation of complex numbers. Using a
property of the cosine function not normally encountered in physics, that it is
irrational for all dyadic rational angles between 0 and pi/2, this
reformulation is shown to have the emergent property of counterfactual
indefiniteness and is therefore not non-locally causal.

    <title>A Note on Several Meteorological Topics Related to Polar Regions</title>
    <summary>  Analysis of the meteorology of Polar Regions is fundamental to the process of
understanding the global climatology of the Earth and Earth-like planets. The
nature of air circulation in a polar vortex is of preliminary importance. I
have show that the local and continental spatiotemporal relationship between
near surface wind events is self-organized criticality. In particular, the wind
event size, wind event duration, and duration of quiescent wind event are well
approximated by power-law distributions. On a continental scale, the wind
events in the Antarctic tend to be self-organized criticality with ergodic
properties. A similar self-organized criticality wind event was also found in
Taylor Valley located at McMurdo Dry Valleys discovered by Captain Scott's
expedition. Captain Scott's meteorological Terra Nova record was also examined.
I have also revisited and re-analyzed wind events in Hornsund at Spitsbergen
Island, in terms of marginal probabilities and marginal copulas which describe
positive L\'evy process.
  Key-Words: Antarctic, Wind Circulation, Self-organized Criticality, L\'evy

    <title>The interaction between air ions and aerosol particles in the atmosphere</title>
    <summary>  Charged particles are continually generated in atmospheric air, and the
interaction between natural ionisation and atmospheric particles is
complicated. It is of some climatic importance to establish if ions are
implicated in particle formation. Atmospheric ion concentrations have been
investigated here at high temporal resolution, using Gerdien ion analysers at a
site where synchronous meteorological measurements were also made. The
background ionisation rate was also monitored with a Geiger counter, enabling
ion production from natural radioactivity to be distinguished from other
effects. Measurements at 1Hz offer some promise in establishing the atmospheric
electrical influences in ionic nucleation bursts, although combinations of
other meteorological factors are also known to be significant. High time
resolution meteorological and ion measurements are therefore clearly necessary
in advancing basic understanding in the behaviour of atmospheric aerosol.

    <title>Similarity between nuclear rainbow and meteorological rainbow --
  evidence for nuclear ripples</title>
    <summary>  We present evidence for the nuclear ripples superimposed on the Airy
structure of the nuclear rainbow, which is similar to the meteorological
rainbow. The mechanism of the nuclear ripples is also similar to that of the
meteorological rainbow, which is caused by the interference between the
externally reflective waves and refractive waves. The nuclear ripple structure
was confirmed by analyzing the elastic angular distribution in
$^{16}$O+$^{12}$C rainbow scattering at $E_L$=115.9 MeV using the coupled
channels method by taking account of coupling to the excited states of $^{12}$C
and $^{16}$O with a double folding model derived from a density-dependent
effective nucleon-nucleon force with realistic wave functions for $^{12}$C and
$^{16}$O. The coupling to the excited states plays the role of creating the
external reflection.

    <title>Spatial interpolation of high-frequency monitoring data</title>
    <summary>  Climate modelers generally require meteorological information on regular
grids, but monitoring stations are, in practice, sited irregularly. Thus, there
is a need to produce public data records that interpolate available data to a
high density grid, which can then be used to generate meteorological maps at a
broad range of spatial and temporal scales. In addition to point predictions,
quantifications of uncertainty are also needed. One way to accomplish this is
to provide multiple simulations of the relevant meteorological quantities
conditional on the observed data taking into account the various uncertainties
in predicting a space-time process at locations with no monitoring data. Using
a high-quality dataset of minute-by-minute measurements of atmospheric pressure
in north-central Oklahoma, this work describes a statistical approach to
carrying out these conditional simulations. Based on observations at 11
stations, conditional simulations were produced at two other sites with
monitoring stations. The resulting point predictions are very accurate and the
multiple simulations produce well-calibrated prediction uncertainties for
temporal changes in atmospheric pressure but are substantially overconservative
for the uncertainties in the predictions of (undifferenced) pressure.

    <title>Meteorological time series forecasting based on MLP modelling using
  heterogeneous transfer functions</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose to study four meteorological and seasonal time
series coupled with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modeling. We chose to
combine two transfer functions for the nodes of the hidden layer, and to use a
temporal indicator (time index as input) in order to take into account the
seasonal aspect of the studied time series. The results of the prediction
concern two years of measurements and the learning step, eight independent
years. We show that this methodology can improve the accuracy of meteorological
data estimation compared to a classical MLP modelling with a homogenous
transfer function.

    <title>Calculation of geometric characteristics of land cover and urban canyon
  for multi-scale parameterization of megalopolis meteorological models</title>
    <summary>  The results of studies on the development of computational techniques for
geometric and thematic characteristics of the underlying surface and urban
canyon are presented. These characteristics are intended for parameterization
of the local model of energy-mass exchange between the surface layer of the
atmosphere and the surface of the active layer of the underlying urban areas
(cities). Multiscale database of parameters of the underlying surface with a
resolution of 200, 500 and 1000 meters is obtained. The use of
micro-meteorology models that take into account the specificity of the urban
environment, coupled with mesoscale prognostic models will significantly
improve the sound quality of the meteorological fields and local operational
weather forecasting in the metropolitan areas where considering the
hydrometeorological situation is particularly important.

    <title>New Meteorological and Geological Study of Taviano (LE)</title>
    <summary>  This paper contains the result of the elaboration of informations about Solar
Irradiation, Geological, Meteorological and Climatic from the point of view of
the quantitative data and social interaction recorded in Taviano (LE) over 24
years. These data are compared to check local variations, long term trends, and
correlation with mean annual temperature. The ultimate goal of this work is to
understand long term climatic changes in this geographic area. The classes of
event considerated are hydrogeological phenomena, sun irradiation, seismic,
volcanic, meteorological and climatological event. Only event occurred between
1990 and 2014 are considerated. The analysis is performed using a statistical
approach. A particular care is used to minimize any effect due to prejudices in
case of lack of data. Finally, we calculate the annual average from the monthly
ones. Data on this paper don't come from a complete census of phenomena; they
are considered enough representative of the accepted vulnerability level at the
beginning of this study.

    <title>Spatiotemporal Analysis of Meteorological Drought Variability in the
  Indian Region Using Standardized Precipitation Index</title>
    <summary>  Grid (1{\deg} latitude x 1{\deg} longitude) level daily rainfall data over
India from June to September for the years 1951 to 2007, generated by India
Meteorological Department, was analyzed to build monthly time series of
Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Analysis of SPI was done to study the
spatial and temporal patterns of drought occurrence in the country. Geographic
spread of SPI derived Area under Dryness (AUD) in different years revealed the
uniqueness of 2002 drought with wide spread dryness in July. Mann-Kendal trend
analysis and moving average based trends performed on AUD indicated increasing
trend in July. The area under moderate drought frequency has increased in the
most recent decade. Ranking of years based on Drought Persistency Score (DPS)
indicated that the year 1987 was the severe-most drought year in the country.
The results of the study have revealed various aspects of drought climatology
in India. A similar analysis with the SPI of finer spatial resolution and
relating it to crop production would be useful in quantifying the impact of
drought in economic terms.

    <title>Investigation Of The Hydro-Meteorological Hazards Along The Bulgarian
  Coast Of The Black Sea By Reconstructions Of Historical Storms</title>
    <summary>  Information about the hydro-meteorological parameters during the extreme sea
storms is of significant importance for the sustainable development in the
context of flood risk for the coastal areas. Usually there is a lack of
sufficiently long history of instrumental measurements of the extreme winds,
waves and storm surges. Simulation of historical storms is an important tool to
evaluate the potential coastal hazards. In the absence of measured data
hindcasts can satisfy the need for historical data. The wave and storm-surge
regional numerical simulations have been carried out for the ten most severe
storms over the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea from the period 1972-2012. The
ERA-Interim and ERA-40 reanalysis of wind at 10 m and mean sea level pressure
have been downscaled with a high resolution atmospheric model ALADIN to the
horizontal and time scales suitable for precise evaluation of
hydro-meteorological parameters during the storms. The downscaled fields of
wind and sea level pressure have been used as input for the wave and storm
surge models.

    <title>Influence of synoptic and local atmospheric patterns on PM10 air
  pollution levels: a model application to Naples (Italy)</title>
    <summary>  We investigate the relationship between synoptic/local meteorological
patterns and PM10 air pollution levels in the metropolitan area of Naples,
Italy. We found that severe air pollution crises occurred when the 850 and 500
hpa geopotential heights and their relative temperatures present maximum values
above the city. The most relevant synoptic parameter was the 850 hPa
geopotential height, which is located about 1500 m of altitude. We compared
local meteorological conditions (specifically wind stress, rain amount and
thermal inversion) against the urban air pollution levels from 2009 to 2013. We
found several empirical criteria for forecasting high daily PM10 air pollution
levels in Naples. Pollution crises occurred when (a) the wind stress was
between 1 and 2 m/s, (b) the thermal inversion between two strategic locations
was at least 3{\deg}C/200m and (c) it did not significantly rain for at least 7
days. Beside these meteorological conditions, severe pollution crises occurred
also during festivals when fireworks and bonfires are lighted, and during
anomalous breeze conditions and severe fire accidents. Finally, we propose a
basic model to predict PM10 concentration levels from local meteorological
conditions that can be easily forecast a few days in advance. The synthetic
PM10 record predicted by the model was found to correlate with the PM10
observations with a correlation coefficient close to 0.80 with a confidence
greater than 99%. The proposed model is expected to provide reliable
information to city officials to carry out practical strategies to mitigate air
pollution effects. Although the proposed model equation is calibrated on the
topographical and meteorological conditions of Naples, it should be easily
adaptable to alternative locations.

    <title>Stability of Semi-Implicit and Iterative Centred-Implicit Time
  Discretizations for Various Equation Systems Used in NWP</title>
    <summary>  The stability of classical semi-implicit scheme, and some more advanced
iterative schemes recently proposed for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)
purpose is examined. In all these schemes, the solution of the centred-implicit
non-linear equation is approached by an iterative fixed-point algorithm,
preconditioned by a simple, constant in time, linear operator. A general
methodology for assessing analytically the stability of these schemes on
canonical problems for a vertically unbounded atmosphere is presented. The
proposed method is valid for all the equation systems usually employed in NWP.
However, as in earlier studies, the method can be applied only in simplified
meteorological contexts, thus overestimating the actual stability that would
occur in more realistic meteorological contexts. The analysis is performed in
the spatially-continuous framework, hence allowing to eliminate the
spatial-discretisation or the boundary conditions as possible causes of the
fundamental instabilities linked to the time-scheme itself. The general method
is then shown concretely to apply to various time-discretisation schemes and
equation-systems (namely shallow-water, and fully compressible Euler
equations). Analytical results found in the literature are recovered from the
proposed method, and some original results are presented.

    <title>Combined Daily Monitoring of Aerosol Optical Depths and Water Vapour
  Column Content during LACE 98 and LITFASS 98 Experiments</title>
    <summary>  During summer of 1998 two large-scale complex campaigns, LITFASS98 (May 25th
to June 22nd) and LACE98 (July 13th to August 14th), took place at the
Meteorological Observatory Lindenberg (MOL). The aim of both experiments focus
on the intensive daily observations of atmospheric conditions and the
determination of their fundamental meteorological parameters in the vertical
column over Lindenberg (Lindenberg's Column). About 20 German research
institutions and addition one from the Netherlands, Austria and Russia
participated at the experiments. A wide variety of ground-based instruments was
operated in Lindenberg and Falkenberg, including LIDARs, microwave radiometer
and radiosondes complemented by tethered balloons and aircraft measurements.
For the first time the star- and sunphotometer of MOL were used together with
other geophysical tools. The observations with both photometers were carried
out practically every day and night except during absolutely overcast
conditions. The observed data were processed immediately by a series of
programs developed at Pulkovo Observatory (Russia), and the results (daily
variations of aerosol optical depths and water vapour column content) were
presented at daily briefings. The comparison of these results with radiosonde
and microwave radiometer data demonstrated the usefulness of photometer data
for the calibration of other ground-based observations and satellite
measurements.

    <title>Clear sky fraction above Indonesia: an analysis for astronomical site
  selection</title>
    <summary>  We report a study of cloud cover over Indonesia based on meteorological
satellite data, spanning over the past 15 years (from 1996 to 2010) in order to
be able to select a new astronomical site capable to host a multi-wavelength
astronomical observatory. High spatial resolution of meteorological satellite
data acquired from {\it Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5} ({\it GMS
5}), {\it Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 9} ({\it GOES 9}),
and {\it Multi-functional Transport Satellite-1R} ({\it MTSAT-1R}) are used to
derive yearly average clear fractions over the regions of Indonesia. This
parameter is determined from temperature measurement of the IR3 channel (water
vapor, 6.7 $\mu$m) for high altitude clouds (cirrus) and from the IR1 channel
(10.7 $\mu$m) for lower altitude clouds. Accordingly, an algorithm is developed
to detect the corresponding clouds. The results of this study are then adopted
to select the best possible sites in Indonesia to be analysed further by
performing in situ measurements planned for the coming years. The results
suggest that regions of East Nusa Tenggara, located in south-eastern part of
Indonesia, are the most promising candidates for such an astronomical site.
Yearly clear sky fraction of this regions may reach better than 70 per cent
with an uncertainty of 10 per cent.

    <title>A wave prediction system for real time sea state forecasting in Black
  Sea</title>
    <summary>  This paper briefly describes the existing operational system for wind waves
forecasting in the Black Sea. It is a system of coupled atmospheric and wave
numerical models aiming at a detailed and accurate sea state forecast on an
operational level. The system was created at the National Institute of
Meteorology and Hydrology Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (NIMH-BAS) in
collaboration with the Meteorological Office of France - Meteo-France. The
present work introduces the use of wave models at NIMH-BAS and shows the model
results, as well as an intercomparison. The numerical wave models VAG,
WAVEWATCH III and WAM, developed by the research groups of Meteo-France, NCEP
and WAMDI, have been adopted for the Black Sea area and implemented at the
NIMH-BAS to allow real-time forecasts and hindcasts of the waves in the Black
Sea. The coupling of two atmospherics models ARPEGE and ALADIN has been used to
force the wave models. The operational use has indicated that the system is
suitable for general purposes and the results are generally satisfactory. The
wave models are evaluated through a comparison with the altimeter satellite
measurements. A comparison between the model results and the altimeter data
from the satellites ERS1/2 and ENVISAT demonstrates that the models call fairly
reproduces the observed characteristics of waves.

    <title>Larval dispersal of intertidal organisms and the influence of coastline
  geography</title>
    <summary>  The dispersal stages of organisms with sessile adults must be able to select
habitats with suitable conditions for establishment and survival, and must also
be able to reach those locations. For marine planktonic larvae, movement due to
currents is often orders of magnitude greater than movement due to swimming
behaviour, so transport is largely passive.
  Current patterns are determined by the interaction of geography with tidal
forces, modified by meteorological conditions. These linkages impose an
area-specific focus to connectivity studies. Yet, how geographical features and
meteorological forcing combine to produce specific current patterns and
resultant connectivity among populations remains unclear.
  In this study, we followed tracks of generic particles driven by modelled
hydrodynamic currents to investigate how connectivity between evenly spaced
habitat sites varies in relation to coastal topography. Larvae released from
regions of high current velocity, open coastline and low local habitat
availability travelled furthest but were less likely to disperse successfully.
Extensive natal habitat in the vicinity of a site generally had a positive
impact on the number of larvae arriving, as did low current velocities.
However, relationships between numbers of arriving larvae and local
geographical indices were complex, particularly at longer larval durations.
  Local geography alone explained up to 50% of the variance in success of
larvae released and around 10% of the variation in the number of larvae
arriving at each site, but coastline properties fall short of predicting
dispersal measures for particular locations. The study shows that
meteorological variation and broad scale current patterns interact strongly
with local geography to determine connectivity in coastal areas.

    <title>On the concept of exergy and available enthalpy: Application to
  atmospheric energetics</title>
    <summary>  The available enthalpy is an early form of the modern thermodynamic concept
of exergy, which is the generic name for the amount of work obtainable when
some matter is brought to a state of equilibrium with its surroundings by means
of reversible processes.
  It is shown in this paper that a study of the hydrodynamic properties of
available enthalpy leads to a generalization of the global meteorological
available energies previously introduced by Lorenz, Dutton and Pearce. A local
energy cycle is derived without approximation. Moreover, static instabilities
or topography do not prevent this theory from having practical applications.
The concept of available enthalpy is also presented in terms of the potential
change in total entropy. Using the hydrostatic assumption, limited-area
energetics is then rigorously defined, including new boundary fluxes and new
energy components. This innovative approach is especially suitable for the
study of energy conversions between isobaric layers of an open limited
atmospheric domain.
  Numerical evaluations of various energy components are presented for a
hemispheric field of zonal-average temperature. It is further shown that this
new energetic scheme realizes a hierarchical partition of the components so
that the smallest of those available enthalpy reservoirs are almost of the same
magnitude as the kinetic energy. This is actually the fundamental property that
induced Margules to define the primary concept of available kinetic energy in
meteorology.

    <title>Analysis of global Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes distribution and
  special focus on AGILE detections over South America</title>
    <summary>  Global distribution of the Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) detected by
AGILE and RHESSI for the period from March 2009 to July 2012 has been analysed.
A fourth TGF production region has been distinguished over the Pacific. It is
confirmed that TGF occurrence follows the Intertropical Convergence Zone(ITCZ)
seasonal migration and prefers afternoons. TGF/lightning ratio appears to be
lower over America than other regions suggesting that meteorological regional
differences are important for the TGF production. Diurnal cycle of TGFs peaks
in the afternoon suggesting that Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)
and convection are important for TGF production. Moreover all AGILE passages
over South America in the same period have been analysed to find meteorological
preferences for TGF occurrence. In each passage the analysis of Cloud Top
Altitude (CTA), CAPE, number of strokes, number of storms and coverage area of
clouds with temperatures below $-70\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$ (Cloud Top Coverage area,
CTC) are computed. On average, AGILE has been exposed to 19,100 strokes between
each TGF representing $\sim$68 hours of exposure over active storms. High CAPE
values, high cloud tops and high stroke occurrence suggests that meteorological
conditions conducive to vigorous and electrically active storms are important
for TGF production. It is shown that a high number of thunderstorms is
preferable for TGF production which may be explained by a greater chance of the
presence of a thunderstorm in the best development stage for TGF production.
High tropopause altitude seems to be important but not primordial for TGF
production.

    <title>Nonstationary POT modelling of air pollution concentrations: Statistical
  analysis of the traffic and meteorological impact</title>
    <summary>  Predicting the occurrence, level and duration of high air pollution
concentrations exceeding a given critical level enables researchers to study
the health impact of road traffic on local air quality and to inform public
policy action. Precise estimates of the probabilities of occurrence and level
of extreme concentrations are formidable due to the combination of complex
physical and chemical processes involved. This underpins the need for
developing sophisticated extreme value models, in particular allowing for
non-stationarity of environmental time series. In this paper, extremes of
nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$) and ozone (O$_3$) concentrations
are investigated using two models. Model I is based on an extended
peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach developed by A. C. Davison and R. L. Smith,
whereby the parameters of the underlying generalized Pareto distribution (GPD)
are treated as functions of covariates (i.e., traffic and meteorological
factors). The new Model II resolves the lack of threshold stability in the
Davison--Smith model by constructing a special functional form for the GPD
parameters. For each of the models, the effects of trafic and meteorological
factors on the frequency and size of extreme values are estimated using Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods. Finally, appropriate goodness-of-fit tests and model
selection criteria confirm that Model II significantly outperforms Model I in
estimation and forecasting of extremes.

  Methods: The correlations between GBS, dengue, Multivariate El Nino Southern
Oscillation Index (MEI) and local meteorological data were explored by the
Spearman Rank correlations and cross-correlations between these time series.
Poisson regression models were fitted to identify nonlinear associations
between MEI and dengue. Cross wavelet analysis was applied to infer potential
non-stationary oscillating associations among MEI, dengue and GBS.
  Findings : An increasing trend was found for both GBS cases and imported
dengue cases in Hong Kong. We found a weak but statistically significant
negative correlation between GBS and local meteorological factors. MEI
explained over 12\% of dengue's variations from Poisson regression models.
Wavelet analyses showed that there is possible non-stationary oscillating
association between dengue and GBS from 2005 to 2015 in Hong Kong. Our study
has led to an improved understanding of the timing and relationship between
GBS, dengue and MEI.

    <title>Meteorology-Aware Multi-Goal Path Planning for Large-Scale Inspection
  Missions with Long-Endurance Solar-Powered Aircraft</title>
    <summary>  Solar-powered aircraft promise significantly increased flight endurance over
conventional aircraft. While this makes them promising candidates for
large-scale aerial inspection missions, their structural fragility necessitates
that adverse weather is avoided using appropriate path planning methods. This
paper therefore presents MetPASS, the Meteorology-aware Path Planning and
Analysis Software for Solar-powered UAVs. MetPASS is the first path planning
framework in the literature that considers all aspects that influence the
safety or performance of solar-powered flight: It avoids environmental risks
(thunderstorms, rain, wind, wind gusts and humidity) and exploits advantageous
regions (high sun radiation or tailwind). It also avoids system risks such as
low battery state of charge and returns safe paths through cluttered terrain.
MetPASS imports weather data from global meteorological models, propagates the
aircraft state through an energetic system model, and then combines both into a
cost function. A combination of dynamic programming techniques and an
A*-search-algorithm with a custom heuristic is leveraged to plan globally
optimal paths in station-keeping, point-to-point or multi-goal aerial
inspection missions with coverage guarantees. A full software implementation
including a GUI is provided. The planning methods are verified using three
missions of ETH Zurich's AtlantikSolar UAV: An 81-hour continuous solar-powered
station-keeping flight, a 4000km Atlantic crossing from Newfoundland to
Portugal, and two multi-glacier aerial inspection missions above the Arctic
Ocean performed near Greenland in summer 2017.

    <title>Dynamic Meteorology at the Photosphere of HD 209458b</title>
    <summary>  We calculate the meteorology of the close-in transiting extrasolar planet HD
209458b using a global, three-dimensional atmospheric circulation model.
Dynamics are driven by perpetual irradiation of one hemisphere of this tidally
locked planet. The simulation predicts global temperature contrasts of ~500 K
at the photosphere and the development of a steady superrotating jet. The jet
extends from the equator to mid-latitudes and from the top model layer at 1
mbar down to 10 bars at the base of the heated region. Wind velocities near the
equator exceed 4 km/s at 300 mbar. The hottest regions of the atmosphere are
blown downstream from the substellar point by 60 degrees of longitude. We
predict from these results a factor of ~2 ratio between the maximum and minimum
observed radiation from the planet over a full orbital period, with peak
infrared emission preceding the time of the secondary eclipse by ~14 hours.

    <title>Meteorologic parameters analysis above Dome C made with ECMWF data</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we present the characterization of all the principal
meteorological parameters (wind speed and direction, pressure, absolute and
potential temperature) extended over 25 km from the ground and over two years
(2003 and 2004) above the Antarctic site of Dome C. The data set is composed by
'analyses' provided by the General Circulation Model (GCM) of the European
Center for Medium Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and they are part of the catalog
MARS. A monthly and seasonal (summer and winter time) statistical analysis of
the results is presented. The Richardson number is calculated for each month of
the year over 25 km to study the stability/instability of the atmosphere. This
permits us to trace a map indicating where and when the optical turbulence has
the highest probability to be triggered on the whole troposphere, tropopause
and stratosphere. We finally try to predict the best expected isoplanatic angle
and wavefront coherence time employing the Richardson number maps, the wind
speed profiles and simple analytical models of CN2 vertical profiles.

    <title>Critical phenomena in atmospheric precipitation</title>
    <summary>  Critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions are typically observed
on the scale of wavelengths of visible light[1]. Here we report similar
phenomena for atmospheric precipitation on scales of tens of kilometers. Our
observations have important implications not only for meteorology but also for
the interpretation of self-organized criticality (SOC) in terms of
absorbing-state phase transitions, where feedback mechanisms between order- and
tuning-parameter lead to criticality.[2] While numerically the corresponding
phase transitions have been studied,[3, 4] we characterise for the first time a
physical system believed to display SOC[5] in terms of its underlying phase
transition. In meteorology the term quasi-equilibrium (QE)[6] refers to a state
towards which the atmosphere is driven by slow large-scale processes and rapid
convective buoyancy release. We present evidence here that QE, postulated two
decades earlier than SOC[7], is associated with the critical point of a
continuous phase transition and is thus an instance of SOC.

    <title>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: Applications for Prediction of Weather and
  Climate</title>
    <summary>  Turbulence, namely, irregular fluctuations in space and time characterize
fluid flows in general and atmospheric flows in particular.The irregular,i.e.,
nonlinear space-time fluctuations on all scales contribute to the unpredictable
nature of both short-term weather and long-term climate.It is of importance to
quantify the total pattern of fluctuations for predictability studies. The
power spectra of temporal fluctuations are broadband and exhibit inverse power
law form with different slopes for different scale ranges. Inverse power-law
form for power spectra implies scaling (self similarity) for the scale range
over which the slope is constant. Atmospheric flows therefore exhibit multiple
scaling or multifractal structure.Standard meteorological theory cannot explain
satisfactorily the observed multifractal structure of atmospheric
flows.Selfsimilar spatial pattern implies long-range spatial correlations.
Atmospheric flows therefore exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations,
namely,self-organized criticality,signifying order underlying apparent chaos. A
recently developed non-deterministic cell dynamical system model for
atmospheric flows predicts the observed self-organized criticality as intrinsic
to quantumlike mechanics governing flow dynamics.The model predictions are in
agreement with continuous periodogram spectral analysis of meteorological data
sets.

    <title>The Role of Downward Momentum Transport in the Generation of Convective
  Downbursts</title>
    <summary>  A downburst index has been developed to assess the magnitude of convective
downbursts associated with heavy precipitation-producing (HP) convective
systems. The index, designed for use during the warm season over the central
and eastern continental United States, is composed of relevant parameters that
represent the simultaneous physical processes of convective updraft development
and downburst generation, incorporating positive buoyant energy or convective
available potential energy (CAPE) and the vertical equivalent potential
temperature gradient between the surface and the mid-troposphere. In addition
to large CAPE and the presence of a vertical equivalent potential temperature
gradient gradient, previous research has identified other favorable conditions
for downburst generation during cold-season convection events. A primary
mechanism in downburst generation associated with synoptically forced
convective systems is the downward transport of higher momentum possessed by
winds in the mid-troposphere.

    <title>Data assimilation as a nonlinear dynamical systems problem: Stability
  and convergence of the prediction-assimilation system</title>
    <summary>  We study prediction-assimilation systems, which have become routine in
meteorology and oceanography and are rapidly spreading to other areas of the
geosciences and of continuum physics. The long-term, nonlinear stability of
such a system leads to the uniqueness of its sequentially estimated solutions
and is required for the convergence of these solutions to the system's true,
chaotic evolution. The key ideas of our approach are illustrated for a
linearized Lorenz system. Stability of two nonlinear prediction-assimilation
systems from dynamic meteorology is studied next via the complete spectrum of
their Lyapunov exponents; these two systems are governed by a large set of
ordinary and of partial differential equations, respectively. The degree of
data-induced stabilization is crucial for the performance of such a system.
This degree, in turn, depends on two key ingredients: (i) the observational
network, either fixed or data-adaptive; and (ii) the assimilation method.

    <title>Monitoring of the terrestrial atmospheric characteristics with using of
  stellar and solar photometry</title>
    <summary>  On the basis of experience acquired at creation of the Pulkovo
Spectrophotometric Catalog the method of investigation of a terrestrial
atmospheric components (aerosols and water vapor) in night time are designed.
For these purposes the small-sized photometers were created. Carried out in
1995-1999{\Gamma}.{\Gamma}. series of night and daily monitoring of the
atmospheric condition in Pulkovo, in MGO by A.I.Voejkov., in Germany (complex
experiments LITFASS 98 and LACE 98) confirmed suitability of devices,
techniques of observations and their reduction designed in Pulkovo Observatory
for the solution of geophysical and ecological problems. A final aim of this
work - creation of small-sized automatic complexes (telescope + photometer),
which would be rightful component of meteorological observatories. Such
complexes will work without the help of the observer and would provide the
daily monitoring of a terrestrial atmosphere.

    <title>Impact of solar activity on climate changes in Athens region, Greece</title>
    <summary>  The scope of this work is to study the role that the solar weather plays in
terrestrial weather. For this reason we study the effect of the solar activity
on the climate changes in Greece. In the current work we look for possible
correlation between the solar activity data spanning the years from 1975 to
2000 and the meteorological data from two weather stations based inside the
city of Athens, Greece (New Philadelphia) and in greater Athens in the north of
Attica (Tatoi area). We examine the annual variations of the average values of
six meteorological parameters: temperature, atmospheric pressure, direction and
intensity of wind, rainfall and relative air humidity. The solar data include
decade variations, within the above period, of the solar irradiance, mean
sunspot number between two solar cycles, magnetic cycle influence, and solar UV
driving of climate (radio flux).

    <title>A simple evaluation of global and diffuse luminous efficacy for all sky
  conditions in tropical and humid climate</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents initial values of global and diffuse luminous efficacy at
Saint-Pierre (Reunion Island). Firstly, data used were measured for a period of
6 months, from February to June 2008. During this period, all defined day-types
have been studied (clear, cloudy and intermediate). Generally, the
meteorological database of Reunion does not contain information for illuminance
values. On the other hand, the local meteorological center has a 60-years-old
database for solar irradiance (W.m-2). So it is important to determine Luminous
Efficacy in order to find illuminance from solar irradiance (or luminance from
solar radiance). The measured data were analyzed, and empirical constant models
were developed and presented in this paper in order to determine luminous
efficacy under different sky conditions. A comparison between these empirical
constants (models) and existing models has been made. The method used to define
sky conditions (overcast, intermediate and clear) and day-types
characterization as well as classification will be presented in this work.

    <title>A.Q.M.E.I.S.: Air Quality Meteorological and Enviromental Information
  System in Western Macedonia, Hellas</title>
    <summary>  An operational monitoring, as well as high resolution local-scale
meteorological and air quality forecasting information system for Western
Macedonia, Hellas, has been developed and is operated by the Laboratory of
Atmospheric Pollution and Environmental Physics / TEI Western Macedonia since
2002, continuously improved. In this paper the novelty of information system is
presented, in a dynamic, easily accessible and user-friendly manner. It
consists of a structured system that users have access to and they can
manipulate thoroughly, as well as of a system for accessing and managing
results of measurements in a direct and dynamic way. It provides updates about
the weather and pollution forecast for the next few days (based on current day
information) in Western Macedonia. These forecasts are displayed through
dynamic-interactive web charts and the visual illustration of the atmospheric
pollution of the region in a map using images and animation images.

    <title>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: Applications in Atmospheric Sciences</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric flows, an example of turbulent fluid flows, exhibit fractal
fluctuations of all space-time scales ranging from turbulence scale of mm -sec
to climate scales of thousands of kilometers - years and may be visualized as a
nested continuum of weather cycles or periodicities, the smaller cycles
existing as intrinsic fine structure of the larger cycles. The power spectra of
fractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form signifying long - range
correlations identified as self - organized criticality and are ubiquitous to
dynamical systems in nature and is manifested as sensitive dependence on
initial condition or 'deterministic chaos' in finite precision computer
realizations of nonlinear mathematical models of real world dynamical systems
such as atmospheric flows. Though the selfsimilar nature of atmospheric flows
have been widely documented and discussed during the last three to four
decades, the exact physical mechanism is not yet identified. There now exists
an urgent need to develop and incorporate basic physical concepts of nonlinear
dynamics and chaos into classical meteorological theory for more realistic
simulation and prediction of weather and climate. A review of nonlinear
dynamics and chaos in meteorology and atmospheric physics is summarized in this
paper.

    <title>A New Sensitivity Analysis and Solution Method for Scintillometer
  Measurements of Area-Averaged Turbulent Fluxes</title>
    <summary>  Scintillometer measurements of the turbulence inner-scale length $l_o$ and
refractive index structure function $C_n^2$ allow for the retrieval of
large-scale area-averaged turbulent fluxes in the atmospheric surface layer.
This retrieval involves the solution of the non-linear set of equations defined
by the Monin-Obukhov similarity hypothesis. A new method that uses an analytic
solution to the set of equations is presented, which leads to a stable and
efficient numerical method of computation that has the potential of eliminating
computational error. Mathematical expressions are derived that map out the
sensitivity of the turbulent flux measurements to uncertainties in source
measurements such as $l_o$. These sensitivity functions differ from results in
the previous literature; the reasons for the differences are explored.

    <title>Effect of Solar-Terrestrial Phenomena on Solar Cell's Efficiency</title>
    <summary>  It is assumed that the solar cell efficiency of PV device is closely related
to the solar irradiance, considered the solar parameter Global Solar Irradiance
(G) and the meteorological parameters like daily data of Earth Skin Temperature
(E), Average Temperature (T), Relative Humidity (H) and Dew Frost Point (D),
for the coastal city Karachi and a non-coastal city Jacobabad, K and J is used
as a subscripts for parameters of Karachi and Jacobabad respectively. All
variables used here are dependent on the location (latitude and longitude) of
our stations except G. To employ ARIMA modeling, the first eighteen years data
is used for modeling and forecast is done for the last five years data. In most
cases results show good correlation among monthly actual and monthly forecasted
values of all the predictors. Next, multiple linear regression is employed to
the data obtained by ARIMA modeling and models for mean monthly observed G
values are constructed. For each station, two equations are constructed the R2
values are above 93% for each model, showing adequacy of the fit. Our
computations show that Solar cell efficiency can be increased if better
modeling for meteorological predictors governs the process.

    <title>Conjecture on imminent earthquake prediction --- from shaving foam to
  cloud patterns</title>
    <summary>  A conjecture on imminent earthquake prediction is presented. Drastic
geological deformations of crustal rock strata taking place immediately
(hours/days) before an earthquake may cause fast air or gas emission/absorption
vertically in between ground and sky. I conjecture, inspired by an observation
of strange patterns appearing on shaving foam, that this fast movement of air
fluid may produce unusual cloud patterns at interfaces between atmosphere
levels. This air movement is vertical and drastic, different from the
horizontal and moderate meteorological air movement, hence its caused cloud
patterns are expected to be different from meteorological cloud patterns. This
provides a possible origin for the so-called earthquake cloud. Recognition of
different earthquake cloud patterns may provide a practical way to estimate
location, magnitude and strength of geological deformations of rock strata, and
hence a method with support of physics for imminent earthquake prediction. In
the end of this paper an experiment has been designed to test the conjecture.

    <title>DADA: Data Assimilation for the Detection and Attribution of Weather-
  and Climate-related Events</title>
    <summary>  We describe a new approach allowing for systematic causal attribution of
weather and climate-related events, in near-real time. The method is purposely
designed to facilitate its implementation at meteorological centers by relying
on data treatments that are routinely performed when numerically forecasting
the weather. Namely, we show that causal attribution can be obtained as a
by-product of so-called data assimilation procedures that are run on a daily
basis to update the meteorological model with new atmospheric observations;
hence, the proposed methodology can take advantage of the powerful
computational and observational capacity of weather forecasting centers. We
explain the theoretical rationale of this approach and sketch the most
prominent features of a "data assimilation-based detection and attribution"
(DADA) procedure. The proposal is illustrated in the context of the classical
three-variable Lorenz model with additional forcing. Several theoretical and
practical research questions that need to be addressed to make the proposal
readily operational within weather forecasting centers are finally laid out.

    <title>Determining the best fitting distribution of annual precipitation data
  in Serbia using L-moments method</title>
    <summary>  The monthly precipitation data from 29 meteorological stations for the period
1946--2012 from Serbia were used. To describe the behaviour of precipitation
data at a specific location, it is necessary to identify the distribution that
best fits the data. For this purpose, three distributions i.e. generalized
extreme value (GEV), generalized Pareto (GPD) and generalized logistic (GLO)
distribution were fitted using the method of L-moment. The goodness-of-fit for
the selected three distributions was confirmed using L-moment ratio diagram and
three tests namely relative root mean square error, relative mean absolute
error and probability plot correlation coefficient. From the result of this
analysis, the GEV distribution was selected as the best fitting distribution of
annual precipitation data in Serbia. The 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1000-years
return levels are provided.

    <title>Estimation of soil moisture in paddy field using Artificial Neural
  Networks</title>
    <summary>  In paddy field, monitoring soil moisture is required for irrigation
scheduling and water resource allocation, management and planning. The current
study proposes an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model to estimate soil
moisture in paddy field with limited meteorological data. Dynamic of ANN model
was adopted to estimate soil moisture with the inputs of reference
evapotranspiration (ETo) and precipitation. ETo was firstly estimated using the
maximum, average and minimum values of air temperature as the inputs of model.
The models were performed under different weather conditions between the two
paddy cultivation periods. Training process of model was carried out using the
observation data in the first period, while validation process was conducted
based on the observation data in the second period. Dynamic of ANN model
estimated soil moisture with R2 values of 0.80 and 0.73 for training and
validation processes, respectively, indicated that tight linear correlations
between observed and estimated values of soil moisture were observed. Thus, the
ANN model reliably estimates soil moisture with limited meteorological data.

    <title>Probabilistic temperature forecasting with statistical calibration in
  Hungary</title>
    <summary>  Weather forecasting is mostly based on the outputs of deterministic numerical
weather forecasting models. Multiple runs of these models with different
initial conditions result in forecast ensembles which is are used for
estimating the distribution of future atmospheric variables. However, these
ensembles are usually under-dispersive and uncalibrated, so post-processing is
required.
  In the present work Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is applied for calibrating
ensembles of temperature forecasts produced by the operational Limited Area
Model Ensemble Prediction System of the Hungarian Meteorological Service (HMS).
  We describe two possible BMA models for temperature data of the HMS and show
that BMA post-processing significantly improves calibration and probabilistic
forecasts although the accuracy of point forecasts is rather unchanged.

    <title>Innovative Second-Generation Wavelets Construction With Recurrent Neural
  Networks for Solar Radiation Forecasting</title>
    <summary>  Solar radiation prediction is an important challenge for the electrical
engineer because it is used to estimate the power developed by commercial
photovoltaic modules. This paper deals with the problem of solar radiation
prediction based on observed meteorological data. A 2-day forecast is obtained
by using novel wavelet recurrent neural networks (WRNNs). In fact, these WRNNS
are used to exploit the correlation between solar radiation and
timescale-related variations of wind speed, humidity, and temperature. The
input to the selected WRNN is provided by timescale-related bands of wavelet
coefficients obtained from meteorological time series. The experimental setup
available at the University of Catania, Italy, provided this information. The
novelty of this approach is that the proposed WRNN performs the prediction in
the wavelet domain and, in addition, also performs the inverse wavelet
transform, giving the predicted signal as output. The obtained simulation
results show a very low root-mean-square error compared to the results of the
solar radiation prediction approaches obtained by hybrid neural networks
reported in the recent literature.

    <title>Computationally efficient spatial modeling of annual maximum 24 hour
  precipitation. An application to data from Iceland</title>
    <summary>  We propose a computationally efficient statistical method to obtain
distributional properties of annual maximum 24 hour precipitation on a 1 km by
1 km regular grid over Iceland. A latent Gaussian model is built which takes
into account observations, spatial variations and outputs from a local
meteorological model. A covariate based on the meteorological model is
constructed at each observational site and each grid point in order to
assimilate available scientific knowledge about precipitation into the
statistical model. The model is applied to two data sets on extreme
precipitation, one uncorrected data set and one data set that is corrected for
phase and wind. The observations are assumed to follow the generalized extreme
value distribution. At the latent level, we implement SPDE spatial models for
both the location and scale parameters of the likelihood. An efficient MCMC
sampler which exploits the model structure is constructed, which yields fast
continuous spatial predictions for spatially varying model parameters and
quantiles.

    <title>Daily pollution forecast using optimal meteorological data at synoptic
  and local scales</title>
    <summary>  We present a simple framework to easily pre-select the most essential data
for accurately forecasting the concentration of the pollutant PM$_{10}$, based
on pollutants observations for the years 2002 until 2006 in the metropolitan
region of Lisbon, Portugal. Starting from a broad panoply of different data
sets collected at several meteorological stations, we apply a forward stepwise
regression procedure that enables us not only to identify the most important
variables for forecasting the pollutant but also to rank them in order of
importance. We argue the importance of this variable ranking, showing that the
ranking is very sensitive to the urban spot where measurements are taken.
Having this pre-selection, we then present the potential of linear and
non-linear neural network models when applied to the concentration of pollutant
PM$_{10}$. Similarly to previous studies for other pollutants, our validation
results show that non-linear models in average perform as well or worse as
linear models for PM$_{10}$. Finally, we also address the influence of
Circulation Weather Types, characterizing synoptic scale circulation patterns
and the concentration of pollutants.

    <title>New Meteorological and Geological Study of Acquapendente (VT)</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we present an analysis of the geological, meteorological and
climatic data recorded in Acquapendente (VT) over 24 years. These data are
compared to check local variations,long term trends, and correlation with maen
annual temperature. The ultimate goal of this work is to understand logn term
climatic changes in this geographic area. The analysis is performed using a
statistical approach. From each long series of data calculate the hourly
averages and that the monthly averages in order to reduce the fluctuations in
the short time due to the day / night cycle. A particular care is used to
minimize any effect due to prejudices in case of lack of data. Finally, we
calculate the annual average from the monthly ones.

    <title>Long term continuous radon monitoring in a seismically active area</title>
    <summary>  We present the results of a long term, continuous radon monitoring experiment
started in April 2010 in a seismically active area, affected during the
2010-2013 data acquisition time window by an intense micro seismic activity and
by several small seismic events. We employed both correlation and
cross-correlation analyses in order to investigate possible relationship
existing between the collected radon data, seismic events and meteorological
parameters. Our results do not support the feasibility of a robust one-to-one
association between the small magnitude earthquakes characterizing the local
seismic activity and single radon measurement anomalies, but evidence
significant correlation patterns between the spatio-temporal variations of
seismic moment release and soil radon emanations, the latter being anyway
dominantly modulated by meteorological parameters variations.

    <title>Spatial Verification Using Wavelet Transforms: A Review</title>
    <summary>  Due to the emergence of new high resolution numerical weather prediction
(NWP) models and the availability of new or more reliable remote sensing data,
the importance of efficient spatial verification techniques is growing. Wavelet
transforms offer an effective framework to decompose spatial data into separate
(and possibly orthogonal) scales and directions. Most wavelet based spatial
verification techniques have been developed or refined in the last decade and
concentrate on assessing forecast performance (i.e. forecast skill or forecast
error) on distinct physical scales. Particularly during the last five years, a
significant growth in meteorological applications could be observed. However, a
comparison with other scientific fields such as feature detection, image
fusion, texture analysis, or facial and biometric recognition, shows that there
is still a considerable, currently unused potential to derive useful diagnostic
information. In order to tab the full potential of wavelet analysis, we revise
the state-of-the art in one- and two-dimensional wavelet analysis and its
application with emphasis on spatial verification. We further use a technique
developed for texture analysis in the context of high-resolution quantitative
precipitation forecasts, which is able to assess structural characteristics of
the precipitation fields and allows efficient clustering of ensemble data.

    <title>Predicting Urban Water Quality with Ubiquitous Data</title>
    <summary>  Urban water quality is of great importance to our daily lives. Prediction of
urban water quality help control water pollution and protect human health.
However, predicting the urban water quality is a challenging task since the
water quality varies in urban spaces non-linearly and depends on multiple
factors, such as meteorology, water usage patterns, and land uses. In this
work, we forecast the water quality of a station over the next few hours from a
data-driven perspective, using the water quality data and water hydraulic data
reported by existing monitor stations and a variety of data sources we observed
in the city, such as meteorology, pipe networks, structure of road networks,
and point of interests (POIs). First, we identify the influential factors that
affect the urban water quality via extensive experiments. Second, we present a
multi-task multi-view learning method to fuse those multiple datasets from
different domains into an unified learning model. We evaluate our method with
real-world datasets, and the extensive experiments verify the advantages of our
method over other baselines and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    <title>Measuring ionizing radiation in the atmosphere with a new balloon-borne
  detector</title>
    <summary>  Increasing interest in energetic particle effects on weather and climate has
motivated development of a miniature scintillator-based detector intended for
deployment on meteorological radiosondes or unmanned airborne vehicles. The
detector was calibrated with laboratory gamma sources up to 1.3 MeV, and known
gamma peaks from natural radioactivity of up to 2.6 MeV. The specifications of
our device in combination with the performance of similar devices suggest that
it will respond to up to 17 MeV gamma rays. Laboratory tests show the detector
can measure muons at the surface, and it is also expected to respond to other
ionizing radiation including, for example, protons, electrons (&gt;100 keV) and
energetic helium nuclei from cosmic rays or during space weather events. Its
estimated counting error is about 10%. Recent tests, when the detector was
integrated with a meteorological radiosonde system, and carried on a balloon to
~25 km altitude, identified the transition region between energetic particles
near the surface, which are dominated by terrestrial gamma emissions, to
higher-energy particles in the free troposphere.

    <title>Kalman Filtering of Distributed Time Series</title>
    <summary>  This paper aims to introduce an application to Kalman Filtering Theory, which
is rather unconventional. Recent experiments have shown that many natural
phenomena, especially from ecology or meteorology, could be monitored and
predicted more accurately when accounting their evolution over some
geographical area. Thus, the signals they provide are gathered together into a
collection of distributed time series. Despite the common sense, such time
series are more or less correlated each other. Instead of processing each time
series independently, their collection can constitute the set of measurable
states provided by some open system. Modeling and predicting the system states
can take benefit from the family of Kalman filtering algorithms. The article
describes an adaptation of basic Kalman filter to the context of distributed
signals collections and completes with an application coming from Meteorology.

    <title>Random Forest Ensemble of Support Vector Regression Models for Solar
  Power Forecasting</title>
    <summary>  To mitigate the uncertainty of variable renewable resources, two
off-the-shelf machine learning tools are deployed to forecast the solar power
output of a solar photovoltaic system. The support vector machines generate the
forecasts and the random forest acts as an ensemble learning method to combine
the forecasts. The common ensemble technique in wind and solar power
forecasting is the blending of meteorological data from several sources. In
this study though, the present and the past solar power forecasts from several
models, as well as the associated meteorological data, are incorporated into
the random forest to combine and improve the accuracy of the day-ahead solar
power forecasts. The performance of the combined model is evaluated over the
entire year and compared with other combining techniques.

    <title>Nonlinearity in Data with Gaps: Application to Ecological and
  Meteorological Datasets</title>
    <summary>  Datagaps are ubiquitous in real world observational data. Quantifying
nonlinearity in data having gaps can be challenging. Reported research points
out that interpolation can affect nonlinear quantifiers adversely, artificially
introducing signatures of nonlinearity where none exist. In this paper we
attempt to quantify the effect that datagaps have on the multifractal spectrum
($f(\alpha)$), in the absence of interpolation. We identify tolerable gap
ranges, where the measures defining the $f(\alpha)$ curve do not show
considerable deviation from the evenly sampled case. We apply this to the
multifractal spectra of multiple data-sets with missing data from the SMEAR
database. The datasets we consider include ecological datasets from SMEAR I,
namely CO$_2$ exchange variation, photosynthetically active radiation levels
and soil moisture variation time series, and meteorological datasets from SMEAR
II, namely dew point variation and air temperature variation. We could
establish multifractality due to deterministic nonlinearity in two of these
datasets, even in the presence of gaps.

    <title>Study of high energy phenomena from near space using low-cost
  meteorological balloons</title>
    <summary>  Indian Centre for Space Physics has taken a novel strategy to study low
energy cosmic rays and astrophysical X-ray sources which involve very light
weight payloads up to about five kilograms on board a single or multiple
balloons which are usually used for meteorological purposes. The mission
duration could be anywhere from 3-12 hours. Our strategy provides extreme
flexibility in mission preparation and its operation using a very economical
budget. There are several limitations but our innovative approach has been able
to extract significant amount of scientific data out of these missions. So far,
over one hundred missions have been completed by us to near space and a wealth
of data has been collected. The payloads are recovered and are used again.
Scientific data is stored on board computer and the atmospheric data or payload
location is sent to ground in real time. Since each mission is different, we
present here the general strategy for a typical payload and provide some
results we obtained in some of these missions.

    <title>Night sky brightness above Zagreb 2012.-2017</title>
    <summary>  The night sky brightness at the RGN site (near the centre of Zagreb, Croatia)
was monitored form January 2012. to December 2017. The gathered data show that
the average night sky brightness in this period did not change significantly,
apart from differences caused by yearly variations in meteorological
parameters. The nightly minima, maxima and mean values of the sky brightness do
change considerably due to changes in meteorological conditions, often being
between 2 and 3 magnitudes. The seasonal probability curves and histograms are
constructed and are used to obtain additional information on the light
pollution at the RGN site. They reveal that the night sky brightness clutters
around two peaks, at about 15.0 mag/arcsec2 and at about 18.2 mag/arcsec2. The
tendency to slightly lower brightness values in spring and summer can also be
seen in the data. Two peaks correspond to cloudy and clear nights respectively,
the difference in brightness between them being about 3 magnitudes. A crude
clear/cloudy criterion can be defined too: the minimum between two peaks is
around 16.7 mag/arcsec2. The brightness values smaller than this are attributed
to clear nights and vice-versa. Comparison with Vienna and Hong-Kong indicates
that the light pollution of Zagreb is a few times larger.

    <title>A Study of Circadian Rhythm and Meteorological Factors Influencing Acute
  Myocardial Infarction</title>
    <summary>  The circadian rhythm in the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
was assessed in three hundred and twenty three patients admitted with AMI
during the two-year period June 1992 to May 1994. The influence of the
following meteorological, solar-geophysical and cosmic parameters in the
causation of an infarct was also considered : (1) surface pressure (2) maximum
temperature (3) minimum temperature (4) relative humidity (5) cosmic ray index
(6) geomagnetic aa index (7) solar flares and (8) sunspot number. A well
pronounced diurnal variability in AMI with a peak in the morning hours (6-12
a.m.) was seen. Further analysis of the data by considering one-hour periods
revealed the presence of a smaller evening (10 p.m.) increase in incidence,
i.e., the existence of a bimodal circadian rhythm. The simultaneous occurrence
of the well documented semi-diurnal rhythm in surface pressure and incidence of
acute myocardial infarction were evident. This may be one of the factors
involved in the causation of the smaller evening peak-the reasons for which
were unclear till now. Month-to-month variation in surface pressure was also
found to be significantly correlated with incidence of acute myocardial
infarction. Recognition of a circadian rhythm in the onset of AMI suggests the
need for enhanced pharmacological protection during the vulnerable periods.
Significant correlations were also found between monthly incidence of AMI and
month-to-month variation of cosmic ray index and solar flare counts. The
pattern of incidence of AMI was seen to be modified by full moon and new moon.
There was no association between maximum temperature, minimum temperature or
relative humidity and incidence of AMI.

    <title>Scaling behaviour in daily air humidity fluctuations</title>
    <summary>  We show that the daily average air humidity fluctuations exhibit non-trivial
$1/f^{\alpha}$ behaviour which different from the spectral properties of other
meteorological quantities. This feature and the fractal spatial strucure found
in clouds make it plausible to regard air humidity fluctuations as a
manifestation of self-organized criticality. We give arguments why the dynamics
in air humidity can be similar to those in sandpile models of SOC.

    <title>Sub-Suns and Low Reynolds Number Flow</title>
    <summary>  The phenomenon called the ``sub-Sun'' is the specular reflection of sunlight
by horizontally oriented plates of ice. Although well-known in meteorological
optics, the hydrodynamics of the orientation is not quantitatively understood.
I review the theory of torques on objects at low Reynolds numbers, define
coefficients $C_o$, $C_p$, and $C_\psi$ which describe the orienting torques on
discs, rods, and hexagonal prisms, and report here the results of experiments
to measure $C_o$ and $C_p$.

    <title>Duty cycle of Doppler ground-based asteroseismic observations</title>
    <summary>  We report the observations of the clear sky fraction at the Concordia station
during winter 2006, and derive from it the duty cycle for astronomical
observations. Performance in duty cycle and observation duration promotes Dome
C for efficient asteroseismic observations. This performance is analyzed and
compared to network observation. For network observations, simulations were run
considering the helioseismic network GONG as a reference. Observations with 1
site in Antarctica provide performance similar or better than with a 6-site
network, since the duty cycle limited by meteorology is as high as 92%. On
bright targets, a 100-day long time series with a duty cycle about 87% can be
observed, what network observation cannot.

    <title>Possible Solar Influence On Atmospheric Electric Field</title>
    <summary>  A cell dynamical system model for the troposphere - ionosphere coupling is
proposed . Vertical mass exchange in the troposphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere
takes place through a chain of eddy systems. Any perturbation in the
troposphere would be transmitted to ionosphere and vice versa. A global
perturbation in ionosphere, as the one caused by solar variability, is
transmitted to troposphere influencing weather systems/geomagnetic/atmospheric
electrification processes.

    <title>Long term object drift in the ocean with tide and wind</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a new method to forecast the drift of objects in
near coastal ocean on a period of several weeks. The proposed approach consists
in estimating the probability of events linked to the drift using Monte Carlo
simulations. It couples an averaging method which permits to decrease the
computational cost and a statistical method in order to take into account the
variability of meteorological loading factors.

    <title>Anticipation of summer monsoon rainfall over India by Artificial Neural
  Network with Conjugate Gradient Descent Learning</title>
    <summary>  Present study aims to develop a predictive model for the average summer
monsoon rainfall amount over India. The dataset made available by the Indian
Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, has been explored. To develop the
predictive model, Backpropagation method with Conjugate Gradient Descent
algorithm has been implemented. The Neural Net model with the said algorithm
has been learned thrice to reach a good result. After three runs of the model,
it is found that a high prediction yield is available. Ultimately, Artificial
Neural Network with Conjugate Gradient Descent based Backpropagation algorithm
is found to be skillful in predicting average summer monsoon rainfall amount
over India.

reference state, usually applied in NWP to define the linear system of
constant-coefficients semi-implicit schemes, is outlined as an unnecessarily
restrictive approach which may be detrimental in terms of stability. It is
shown theoretically that an increased robustness can sometimes be obtained by
choosing the reference linear system in a wider set of possibilities. The
potential benefits of this new approach are illustrated in two simple examples.
The advantage in robustness is not obtained at the price of an increased error
or complexity.

    <title>Rain initiation time in turbulent warm clouds</title>
    <summary>  We present a mean-field model that describes droplet growth due to
condensation and collisions and droplet loss due to fallout. The model allows
for an effective numerical simulation. We study how the rain initiation time
depends on different parameters. We also present a simple model that allows one
to estimate the rain initiation time for turbulent clouds with an inhomogeneous
concentration of cloud condensation nuclei. In particular, we show that
over-seeding even a part of a cloud by small hygroscopic nuclei one can
substantially delay the onset of precipitation.

    <title>Similarity theory and calculation of turbulent fluxes at the surface for
  the stably stratified atmospheric boundary layers</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we revise the similarity theory for the stably stratified
atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), formulate analytical approximations for the
wind velocity and potential temperature profiles over the entire ABL, validate
them against large-eddy simulation and observational data, and develop an
improved surface flux calculation technique for use in operational models.

    <title>Speakable and unspeakable after John Bell</title>
    <summary>  `Philosophy' was speakable for John Bell but is not for many physicists. The
border between philosophy and physics is here illustrated through Brownian
motion and Bell experiments. `Measurement', however, was unspeakable for Bell.
His insistence that the physics of quantum measurement should not be confined
to the laboratory and that physics is concerned with the big world outside
leads us to examples from zoology, meteorology and cosmology.

    <title>A note on boundary-layer friction in baroclinic cyclones</title>
    <summary>  The interaction between extratropical cyclones and the underlying boundary
layer has been a topic of recent discussion in papers by Adamson et. al. (2006)
and Beare (2007). Their results emphasise different mechanisms through which
the boundary layer dynamics may modify the growth of a baroclinic cyclone. By
using different sea-surface temperature distributions and comparing the
low-level winds, the differences are exposed and both of the proposed
mechanisms appear to be acting within a single simulation.

    <title>Universality of rain event size distributions</title>
    <summary>  We compare rain event size distributions derived from measurements in
climatically different regions, which we find to be well approximated by power
laws of similar exponents over broad ranges. Differences can be seen in the
large-scale cutoffs of the distributions. Event duration distributions suggest
that the scale-free aspects are related to the absence of characteristic scales
in the meteorological mesoscale.

    <title>Optical instability of the earth's atmosphere</title>
    <summary>  Meteorological data have been used to calculate refractive index fluctuations
- the indicator of optical instability of the Earth's atmosphere. The
calculations were made for standard pressure levels of the atmosphere in winter
and summer. They are presented as distributions over the Earth's surface. The
findings enabled us to determine preferred areas for astronomical observations
as well as to compare astroclimate conditions of the world's largest
observatories.

    <title>From brain to earth and climate systems: Small-world interaction
  networks or not?</title>
    <summary>  We consider recent reports on small-world topologies of interaction networks
derived from the dynamics of spatially extended systems that are investigated
in diverse scientific fields such as neurosciences, geophysics, or meteorology.
With numerical simulations that mimic typical experimental situations we have
identified an important constraint when characterizing such networks:
indications of a small-world topology can be expected solely due to the spatial
sampling of the system along with commonly used time series analysis based
approaches to network characterization.

    <title>Bayesian logistic betting strategy against probability forecasting</title>
    <summary>  We propose a betting strategy based on Bayesian logistic regression modeling
for the probability forecasting game in the framework of game-theoretic
probability by Shafer and Vovk (2001). We prove some results concerning the
strong law of large numbers in the probability forecasting game with side
information based on our strategy. We also apply our strategy for assessing the
quality of probability forecasting by the Japan Meteorological Agency. We find
that our strategy beats the agency by exploiting its tendency of avoiding
clear-cut forecasts.

    <title>On the Universality of Mesoscience: Science of 'the in-between'</title>
    <summary>  The universality of mesoscales, ranging between elemental particles and the
universe, is discussed here by reviewing widely disparate fields and presenting
four cases, at differing hierarchical levels, from chemistry, chemical
engineering, meteorology, through to astronomy. An underpinning concept,
"Compromise in competition", is highlighted between various dominant, but
competing mechanisms, and is identified here to be the universal origin of
complexity and diversity in such examples. We therefore advance this as a key
underlying principle of an emerging science -- Mesoscience.

    <title>Compressed Sensing Applied to Weather Radar</title>
    <summary>  We propose an innovative meteorological radar, which uses reduced number of
spatiotemporal samples without compromising the accuracy of target information.
Our approach extends recent research on compressed sensing (CS) for radar
remote sensing of hard point scatterers to volumetric targets. The previously
published CS-based radar techniques are not applicable for sampling weather
since the precipitation echoes lack sparsity in both range-time and Doppler
domains. We propose an alternative approach by adopting the latest advances in
matrix completion algorithms to demonstrate the sparse sensing of weather
echoes. We use Iowa X-band Polarimetric (XPOL) radar data to test and
illustrate our algorithms.

    <title>A record of atmospheric 210Pb accumulation in the industrial city</title>
    <summary>  The deposition flux of total atmospheric 210Pb in the industrial city
Rostov-on-Don, Russia from 2002 to 2010 has been measured. The variations in
annual 210Pb deposition flux appear to be mainly correlated with the number of
rains and significant amount of anthropogenic 210Pb, polluted into the surface
layer of air in the home-heating period. The average 210Pb deposition is 1.75
mBq/m3. Several meteorological parameters which are strongly associated with
the fluctuations of concentrations of 210Pb are identified. These results are
useful to provide typical information on the atmosphere radioactivity in an
industrial city.

The data-driven model presented here carries stark implications for the large
increased numbers of hurricanes which it predicts for a warmer world. Moreover,
the rise in recent decades in the numbers of hurricanes in the Atlantic, but
not the Pacific basin, is shown to have a simple explanation in terms of the
specific form of H(z), which yields larger percentage increases when a fixed
increase in sea surface temperature occurs at higher latitudes and lower
temperatures.

    <title>Robustness of nuclear core activity reconstruction by data assimilation</title>
    <summary>  We apply a data assimilation techniques, inspired from meteorological
applications, to perform an optimal reconstruction of the neutronic activity
field in a nuclear core. Both measurements, and information coming from a
numerical model, are used. We first study the robustness of the method when the
amount of measured information decreases. We then study the influence of the
nature of the instruments and their spatial repartition on the efficiency of
the field reconstruction.

    <title>Robust energy transfer mechanism via precession resonance in nonlinear
  turbulent wave systems</title>
    <summary>  A robust energy transfer mechanism is found in nonlinear wave systems, which
favours transfers towards modes interacting via triads with nonzero frequency
mismatch, applicable in meteorology, nonlinear optics and plasma wave
turbulence. We introduce the concepts of truly dynamical degrees of freedom and
triad precession. Transfer efficiency is maximal when the triads' precession
frequencies resonate with the system's nonlinear frequencies, leading to a
collective state of synchronised triads with strong turbulent cascades at
intermediate nonlinearity. Numerical simulations confirm analytical
predictions.

    <title>Robust energy transfer mechanism and critically balanced turbulence via
  non-resonant triads in nonlinear wave systems</title>
    <summary>  A robust energy transfer mechanism is found in nonlinear wave systems, which
favours transfers towards modes interacting via non-resonant triads, applicable
in meteorology, nonlinear optics and plasma wave turbulence. Transfer
efficiency is maximal when the frequency mismatch of the non-resonant triad
balances the system's nonlinear frequency: at intermediate levels of
oscillation amplitudes an instability is triggered that explores unstable
manifolds of periodic orbits, so turbulent cascades are most efficient at
intermediate nonlinearity. Numerical simulations confirm analytical
predictions.

    <title>Bayesian likelihood-free localisation of a biochemical source using
  multiple dispersion models</title>
    <summary>  Localisation of a source of a toxic release of biochemical aerosols in the
atmosphere is a problem of great importance for public safety. Two main
practical difficulties are encountered in this problem: the lack of knowledge
of the likelihood function of measurements collected by biochemical sensors,
and the plethora of candidate dispersion models, developed under various
assumptions (e.g. meteorological conditions, terrain). Aiming to overcome these
two difficulties, the paper proposes a likelihood-free approximate Bayesian
computation method, which simultaneously uses a set of candidate dispersion
models, to localise the source. This estimation framework is implemented via
the Monte Carlo method and tested using two experimental datasets.

    <title>A Note on the Misuse of the Variance Test in Meteorological Studies</title>
    <summary>  The erroneous assumption "for all distributions for which the theoretical
variance can be computed independently from parameters estimated by any method
different from the method of moments" has been used in the case of fitting the
gamma distribution to a rainfall data by Mooley (1973) which was followed by
several researchers. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the test
statistic is generally not even comparable to any central chi-square
distribution. We also describe a method for checking the validity of the
asymptotic distribution for a class of distributions.

    <title>Monofractal nature of air temperature signals reveals their climate
  variability</title>
    <summary>  We use the discrete "wavelet transform microscope" to show that the surface
air temperature signals of weather stations selected in Europe are monofractal.
This study reveals that the information obtained in this way are richer than
previous works studying long range correlations in meteorological stations. The
approach presented here allows to bind the H\"older exponents with the climate
variability. We also establish that such a link does not exist with methods
previously carried out.

    <title>Classification of extremals in a simplified Goddard model on the maximal
  height of rocket flight</title>
    <summary>  We consider a problem on maximizing the height of vertical flight of a
material point ("meteorological rocket") in the presence of a nonlinear
friction and a constant flat gravity field under a bounded thrust and fuel
expenditure. The original Goddard problem is simplified by removing the
dependence on the rocket mass from the equations of motion. Using the maximum
principle we find all possible types of Pontryagin extremals and classify them
w.r.t. problem parameters. Since the velocity of the point can be negative, we
obtain some new types of extremals with two or three switching points, which
optimality should be further investigated.

    <title>Coriolis effect on water waves</title>
    <summary>  This paper is devoted to the study of water waves under the influence of the
gravity and the Coriolis force. It is quite common in the physical literature
that the rotating shallow water equations are used to study such water waves.
We prove a local wellposedness theorem for the water waves equations with
vorticity and Coriolis force, taking into account the dependence on various
physical parameters and we justify rigorously the shallow water model. We also
consider a possible non constant pressure at the surface that can be used to
describe meteorological disturbances such as storms or pressure jumps for
instance.

    <title>Beam Steering Slotted Waveguide Antenna Using Rotating Dielectric Slabs
  for Meteorology Radar</title>
    <summary>  The design, simulation and measurement of a beam steerable slotted waveguide
antenna operating at 9.35 GHz are presented. The proposed beam steerable
antenna consists of a standard rectangular waveguide (RWG) section with two
inserted dielectric slabs. To illustrate the proposed methodology, a 20-slot
array antenna has been designed, built and measured. The beam steering in this
configuration is achieved by rotating the slabs inside the waveguide and
consequently changing the phase of the slots in the far field. A 14{\deg} beam
deflection from near broadside toward end-fire direction is observed with a
good input match, narrow beamwidth, moderate side-lobe performance and
acceptable gain values.

    <title>Regularized Spatial Maximum Covariance Analysis</title>
    <summary>  In climate and atmospheric research, many phenomena involve more than one
meteorological spatial processes covarying in space. To understand how one
process is affected by another, maximum covariance analysis (MCA) is commonly
applied. However, the patterns obtained from MCA may sometimes be difficult to
interpret. In this paper, we propose a regularization approach to promote
spatial features in dominant coupled patterns by introducing smoothness and
sparseness penalties while accounting for their orthogonalities. We develop an
efficient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem by using the
alternating direction method of multipliers. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is illustrated by several numerical examples, including an application
to study how precipitations in east Africa are affected by sea surface
temperatures in the Indian Ocean.

    <title>Weather impacts expressed sentiment</title>
    <summary>  We conduct the largest ever investigation into the relationship between
meteorological conditions and the sentiment of human expressions. To do this,
we employ over three and a half billion social media posts from tens of
millions of individuals from both Facebook and Twitter between 2009 and 2016.
We find that cold temperatures, hot temperatures, precipitation, narrower daily
temperature ranges, humidity, and cloud cover are all associated with worsened
expressions of sentiment, even when excluding weather-related posts. We compare
the magnitude of our estimates with the effect sizes associated with notable
historical events occurring within our data.

    <title>Recover Missing Sensor Data with Iterative Imputing Network</title>
    <summary>  Sensor data has been playing an important role in machine learning tasks,
complementary to the human-annotated data that is usually rather costly.
However, due to systematic or accidental mis-operations, sensor data comes very
often with a variety of missing values, resulting in considerable difficulties
in the follow-up analysis and visualization. Previous work imputes the missing
values by interpolating in the observational feature space, without consulting
any latent (hidden) dynamics. In contrast, our model captures the latent
complex temporal dynamics by summarizing each observation's context with a
novel Iterative Imputing Network, thus significantly outperforms previous work
on the benchmark Beijing air quality and meteorological dataset. Our model also
yields consistent superiority over other methods in cases of different missing
rates.

    <title>Equivalent electric circuit of magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere
  interaction</title>
    <summary>  The aim of this study is to investigate the magnetospheric disturbances
effects on complicated nonlinear system of atmospheric processes. During
substorms and storms, the ionosphere was subjected to rather a significant
Joule heating, and the power of precipitating energetic particles was also
great. Nevertheless, there were no abnormal variations of meteoparameters in
the lower atmosphere. If there is a mechanism for the powerful magnetospheric
disturbance effect on meteorological processes in the atmosphere, it supposes a
more complicated series of many intermediates, and is not associated directly
with the energy that arrives into the ionosphere during storms. I discuss the
problem of the effect of the solar wind electric field sharp increase via the
global electric circuit during magnetospheric disturbances on the cloud layer
formation.

    <title>Wind measurements in Mars' middle atmosphere at equinox and solstice:
  IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometric CO observations</title>
    <summary>  Characterizing the Martian atmosphere is an essential objective to understand
its meteorology and its climate. The lower atmosphere (&lt; 40 km) and middle
atmosphere (40-80 km) of Mars appear dynamically coupled at much higher levels
than in the case of the Earth. The vertical extension of the weather phenomena
is considerable with for example Hadley's cells reaching the top of the neutral
atmosphere (120 km). The circulation in the middle atmosphere modifies the
meteorology of the lower atmosphere, affecting the transport and climatic
processes Observations of the CO rotational lines at millimeter (mm)
wavelengths (Clancy et al 1990) have strongly contributed in the study of the
vertical distribution of this compound and the thermal profile in the
atmosphere of Mars over 0-70 km. Singledish observations of the CO Doppler
lineshift have allowed direct wind measurements in the martian middle
atmosphere near 50 km altitude (Lellouch et al 1991), but at a low spatial
resolution (12'') enabling only an essentially hemispheric resolution of the
martian disk. The use of mm interferometry has allowed us to better spatially
resolve the Martian disk, in order to obtain wind maps of the middle atmosphere
(Moreno et al 2001).

    <title>Signatures of a Universal Spectrum for Atmospheric Interannual
  Variability in Some Disparate Climatic Regimes</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric flows exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations manifested
as the fractal geometry to the global cloud cover pattern concomitant with
inverse power law form for power spectra of temporal fluctuations on all
space-time scales ranging from turbulence(centimeters-seconds) to
climate(kilometers-years). Long-range spatiotemporal correlations are
ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature and are identified as signatures of
self-organized criticality. Standard models in meteorological theory cannot
explain satisfactorily the observed self-organized criticality in atmospheric
flows. Mathematical models for simulation and prediction of atmospheric flows
are nonlinear and do not possess analytical solutions. Finite precision
computer realizations of nonlinear models give unrealistic solutions because of
deterministic chaos, a direct consequence of round-off error growth in
iterative numerical computations. Recent studies show that round-off error
doubles on an average for each iteration of iterative computations. Round-off
error propagates to the main stream computation and gives unrealistic solutions
in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models which incorporate
thousands of iterative computations in long-term numerical integration schemes.
An alternative non-deterministic cell dynamical system model for atmospheric
flows described in this paper predicts the observed self-organized criticality
as intrinsic to quantumlike mechanics governing flow dynamics.

    <title>Turbulence energetics in stably stratified geophysical flows: strong and
  weak mixing regimes</title>
    <summary>  Traditionally, turbulence energetics is characterized by turbulent kinetic
energy (TKE) and modelled using solely the TKE budget equation. In stable
stratification, TKE is generated by the velocity shear and expended through
viscous dissipation and work against buoyancy forces. The effect of
stratification is characterized by the ratio of the buoyancy gradient to
squared shear, called Richardson number, Ri. It is widely believed that at Ri
exceeding a critical value, Ric, local shear cannot maintain turbulence, and
the flow becomes laminar. We revise this concept by extending the energy
analysis to turbulent potential and total energies (TPE and TTE = TKE + TPE),
consider their budget equations, and conclude that TTE is a conservative
parameter maintained by shear in any stratification. Hence there is no
"energetics Ric", in contrast to the hydrodynamic-instability threshold,
Ric-instability, whose typical values vary from 0.25 to 1. We demonstrate that
this interval, 0.25&lt;Ri&lt;1, separates two different turbulent regimes: strong
mixing and weak mixing rather than the turbulent and the laminar regimes, as
the classical concept states. This explains persistent occurrence of turbulence
in the free atmosphere and deep ocean at Ri&gt;&gt;1, clarify principal difference
between turbulent boundary layers and free flows, and provide basis for
improving operational turbulence closure models.

    <title>Microburst windspeed potential assessment: progress and developments</title>
    <summary>  A suite of products has been developed and evaluated to assess hazards
presented by convective downbursts to aircraft in flight derived from the
current generation of GOES. The existing suite of GOES microburst products
employs the sounder to calculate risk based on conceptual models of favorable
environmental profiles for convective downburst generation. Accordingly, a
diagnostic nowcasting product, the Microburst Windspeed Potential Index, is
designed to infer attributes of a favorable microburst environment. In
addition, a GOES-West imager microburst algorithm that employs brightness
temperature differences between band 3 (upper level water vapor), band 4
(longwave infrared window), and split window band 5 has been developed to
supplement the sounder-derived products. This paper provides an updated
assessment of the sounder MWPI and imager microburst algorithms, presents case
studies demonstrating effective operational use of the microburst products, and
presents validation results for the 2008 convective season over United States
Great Plains and Great Basin regions.

    <title>Ultimate Meteorological Question from Observational Astronomers: How
  Good is the Cloud Cover Forecast?</title>
    <summary>  To evaluate the capability of numerical cloud forecast as a meteorological
reference for astronomical observation, we compare the cloud forecast from NCEP
Global Forecast System (GFS) model for total, layer and convective cloud with
normalized satellite observation from the International Satellite Cloud
Climatology Project (ISCCP), for the period of July 2005 to June 2008. In
general, the model forecast is consistent with the ISCCP observation. For total
cloud cover, our result shows the goodness of the GFS model forecast with a
mean error within +/-15% in most areas. The global mean probability of &lt; 30%
forecast error (polar regions excluded) declines from 73% to 58% throughout the
180h forecast period, and is more skilled than ISCCP-based climatology forecast
up to tau~120h. The comparison on layer clouds reveals a distinct negative
regional tendency for low cloud forecast and a questionable positive global
tendency for high cloud forecast. Fractional and binary comparisons are
performed on convective cloud forecast and revealed the GFS model can only
identify less than half of such cloud. In short, our result suggests that the
GFS model can provide satisfactory worldwide total cloud forecast up to a week
ahead for observation scheduling purpose, but layer and convective cloud
forecast is less reliable than the total cloud forecast.

    <title>The Never Ending Gale: its Role in Captain Robert F. Scott and his
  Companions' Deaths</title>
    <summary>  Polar historians and enthusiasts are aware that toward the end of March 1912,
Captain Robert F. Scott reported in his journal a meteorological event, which
was extraordinary as far as its length and strength was concerned. This event
was the gale which according to Captain Scott, lasted nine/ten days. Were the
laws of physics suspended at the end of March 1912 in the Antarctic? I have
shown that the near surface winds in the Antarctic are self-organized
critically and that the winds over the continent form an ergodic system. I have
presented an analysis of wind events in the proximity of Captain Scott's camp
and at Ross Island. By comparing wind events at these locations, and performing
an analysis of a gale's wind duration and strength at One Ton Dep\^ot, I
concluded that Captain Scott's wind record was highly inaccurate. I concluded
that the nine/ten day gale described by Captain Scott, that lasted from March
21 to 29, did not take place. This result combined with my previous analysis of
Captain Scott's temperature record, shows that two black swan meteorological
events: February 27-March 19, 1912 - Extreme Cold Snap and March 21-29, 1912 -
Never Ending Gale reported by Captain Scott, did not take place. Therefore, I
conclude that the deaths of Scott, Wilson and Bowers were a matter of choice
rather than chance.

    <title>A wildland fire modeling and visualization environment</title>
    <summary>  We present an overview of a modeling environment, consisting of a coupled
atmosphere-wildfire model, utilities for visualization, data processing, and
diagnostics, open source software repositories, and a community wiki. The fire
model, called SFIRE, is based on a fire-spread model, implemented by the
level-set method, and it is coupled with the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF)
model. A version with a subset of the features is distributed with WRF 3.3 as
WRF-Fire. In each time step, the fire module takes the wind as input and
returns the latent and sensible heat fluxes. The software architecture uses WRF
parallel infrastructure for massively parallel computing. Recent features of
the code include interpolation from an ideal logarithmic wind profile for
nonhomogeneous fuels and ignition from a fire perimeter with an atmosphere and
fire spin-up. Real runs use online sources for fuel maps, fine-scale
topography, and meteorological data, and can run faster than real time.
Visualization pathways allow generating images and animations in many packages,
including VisTrails, VAPOR, MayaVi, and Paraview, as well as output to Google
Earth. The environment is available from openwfm.org. New diagnostic variables
were added to the code recently, including a new kind of fireline intensity,
which takes into account also the speed of burning, unlike Byram's fireline
intensity.

    <title>The Evolving Flow of Jupiter's White Ovals and Adjacent Cyclones</title>
    <summary>  We present results regarding the dynamical meteorology of Jupiter's White
Ovals at different points in their evolution. Starting from the era with three
White Ovals FA, BC, and DE (Galileo), continuing to the post-merger epoch with
only one Oval BA (Cassini), and finally to Oval BA's current reddened state
(New Horizons), we demonstrate that the dynamics of their flow have similarly
evolved along with their appearance. The northern periphery of Oval BA
increased in speed by 20 m/s from Cassini to New Horizons, ending up at a speed
nearly identical to that of the northern periphery of Oval DE during Galileo.
However, the peak speeds along the southern rim of the newly formed Oval BA
were consistently faster than the corresponding speeds in Oval DE, and they
increased still further between Cassini and New Horizons, ending up at ~140 to
150 m/s. The modest strengthening of the winds in Oval BA, the appearance of
red aerosols, and the appearance of a turbulent, cyclonic feature to Oval BA's
northwest create a strong resemblance with the Great Red Spot from both a
dynamical and morphological perspective. In addition to the White Ovals, we
also measure the winds within two compact cyclonic regions, one in the Galileo
data set and one in the Cassini data set. In the images, these cyclonic
features appear turbulent and filamentary, but our wind field reveals that the
flow manifests as a coherent high-speed collar surrounding relatively quiescent
interiors. Although less studied than their anticyclonic cousins, these
cyclones may offer crucial insights into the planet's cloud-level energetics
and dynamical meteorology.

    <title>Probabilistic Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting Using Ensemble
  Model Output Statistics</title>
    <summary>  Statistical post-processing of dynamical forecast ensembles is an essential
component of weather forecasting. In this article, we present a post-processing
method that generates full predictive probability distributions for
precipitation accumulations based on ensemble model output statistics (EMOS).
We model precipitation amounts by a generalized extreme value distribution that
is left-censored at zero. This distribution permits modelling precipitation on
the original scale without prior transformation of the data. A closed form
expression for its continuous rank probability score can be derived and permits
computationally efficient model fitting. We discuss an extension of our
approach that incorporates further statistics characterizing the spatial
variability of precipitation amounts in the vicinity of the location of
interest. The proposed EMOS method is applied to daily 18-h forecasts of 6-h
accumulated precipitation over Germany in 2011 using the COSMO-DE ensemble
prediction system operated by the German Meteorological Service. It yields
calibrated and sharp predictive distributions and compares favourably with
extended logistic regression and Bayesian model averaging which are state of
the art approaches for precipitation post-processing. The incorporation of
neighbourhood information further improves predictive performance and turns out
to be a useful strategy to account for displacement errors of the dynamical
forecasts in a probabilistic forecasting framework.

    <title>Urban ozone concentration forecasting with artificial neural network in
  Corsica</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric pollutants concentration forecasting is an important issue in air
quality monitoring. Qualitair Corse, the organization responsible for
monitoring air quality in Corsica (France) region, needs to develop a
short-term prediction model to lead its mission of information towards the
public. Various deterministic models exist for meso-scale or local forecasting,
but need powerful large variable sets, a good knowledge of atmospheric
processes, and can be inaccurate because of local climatical or geographical
particularities, as observed in Corsica, a mountainous island located in a
Mediterranean Sea. As a result, we focus in this study on statistical models,
and particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that have shown good results
in the prediction of ozone concentration at horizon h+1 with data measured
locally. The purpose of this study is to build a predictor to realize
predictions of ozone and PM10 at horizon d+1 in Corsica in order to be able to
anticipate pollution peak formation and to take appropriated prevention
measures. Specific meteorological conditions are known to lead to particular
pollution event in Corsica (e.g. Saharan dust event). Therefore, several ANN
models will be used, for meteorological conditions clustering and for
operational forecasting.

    <title>Numerical simulations of Optical Turbulence at low and high horizontal
  resolution in Antarctica with a mesoscale meteorological model</title>
    <summary>  It has already been demonstrated that a mesoscale meteorological model such
as Meso-NH is highly reliable in reproducing 3D maps of optical turbulence.
Preliminary measurements above the Antarctic Plateau have so far indicated a
pretty good value for the seeing: around 0.3" at Dome C. However some
uncertainties remain. That's why our group is focusing on a detailed study of
the atmospheric flow and turbulence in the internal Antarctic Plateau. Our
intention is to use the Meso-NH model to do predictions of the atmospheric flow
and the corresponding optical turbulence in the internal plateau. The use of
this model has another huge advantage: we have access to informations inside an
entire 3D volume which is not the case with observations only. Two different
configurations have been used: a low horizontal resolution (with a mesh-size of
100 km) and a high horizontal resolution with the grid-nesting interactive
technique (with a mesh-size of 1 km in the innermost domain centered above the
area of interest). We present here the turbulence distribution reconstructed by
Meso-NH for 16 nights monitored in winter time 2005, looking at the the seeing
and the surface layer thickness.

    <title>Similarity theory based on the Dougherty-Ozmidov length scale</title>
    <summary>  Local similarity theory is suggested based on the Brunt-Vaisala frequency and
the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy instead the turbulent fluxes
used in the traditional Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Based on dimensional
analysis (Pi theorem), it is shown that any properly scaled statistics of the
small-scale turbulence are universal functions of a stability parameter defined
as the ratio of a reference height z and the Dougherty-Ozmidov length scale
which in the limit of z-less stratification is linearly proportional to the
Obukhov length scale. Measurements of atmospheric turbulence made at five
levels on a 20-m tower over the Arctic pack ice during the Surface Heat Budget
of the Arctic Ocean experiment (SHEBA) are used to examine the behaviour of
different similarity functions in the stable boundary layer. It is found that
in the framework of this approach the non-dimensional turbulent viscosity is
equal to the gradient Richardson number whereas the non-dimensional turbulent
thermal diffusivity is equal to the flux Richardson number. These results are a
consequence of the approximate local balance between production of turbulence
by the mean flow shear and viscous dissipation. The turbulence framework based
on the Brunt-Vaisala frequency and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic
energy may have practical advantages for estimating turbulence when the fluxes
are not directly available.

    <title>Meteorological time series forecasting with pruned multi-layer
  perceptron and 2-stage Levenberg-Marquardt method</title>
    <summary>  A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) defines a family of artificial neural networks
often used in TS modeling and forecasting. Because of its "black box" aspect,
many researchers refuse to use it. Moreover, the optimization (often based on
the exhaustive approach where "all" configurations are tested) and learning
phases of this artificial intelligence tool (often based on the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; LMA) are weaknesses of this approach
(exhaustively and local minima). These two tasks must be repeated depending on
the knowledge of each new problem studied, making the process, long, laborious
and not systematically robust. In this paper a pruning process is proposed.
This method allows, during the training phase, to carry out an inputs selecting
method activating (or not) inter-nodes connections in order to verify if
forecasting is improved. We propose to use iteratively the popular damped
least-squares method to activate inputs and neurons. A first pass is applied to
10% of the learning sample to determine weights significantly different from 0
and delete other. Then a classical batch process based on LMA is used with the
new MLP. The validation is done using 25 measured meteorological TS and
cross-comparing the prediction results of the classical LMA and the 2-stage
LMA.

    <title>Log-normal distribution based EMOS models for probabilistic wind speed
  forecasting</title>
    <summary>  Ensembles of forecasts are obtained from multiple runs of numerical weather
forecasting models with different initial conditions and typically employed to
account for forecast uncertainties. However, biases and dispersion errors often
occur in forecast ensembles, they are usually under-dispersive and uncalibrated
and require statistical post-processing. We present an Ensemble Model Output
Statistics (EMOS) method for calibration of wind speed forecasts based on the
log-normal (LN) distribution, and we also show a regime-switching extension of
the model which combines the previously studied truncated normal (TN)
distribution with the LN.
  Both presented models are applied to wind speed forecasts of the eight-member
University of Washington mesoscale ensemble, of the fifty-member ECMWF ensemble
and of the eleven-member ALADIN-HUNEPS ensemble of the Hungarian Meteorological
Service, and their predictive performances are compared to those of the TN and
general extreme value (GEV) distribution based EMOS methods and to the TN-GEV
mixture model. The results indicate improved calibration of probabilistic and
accuracy of point forecasts in comparison to the raw ensemble and to
climatological forecasts. Further, the TN-LN mixture model outperforms the
traditional TN method and its predictive performance is able to keep up with
the models utilizing the GEV distribution without assigning mass to negative
values.

    <title>An astroclimatological study of candidate sites to host an imaging
  atmospheric Cherenkov telescope in Romania</title>
    <summary>  We come out in this paper with an astroclimatological study of meteorological
data on relative humidity, dew point temperature, air temperature, wind speed,
barometric air pressure, and sky cloudiness recorded at four Romanian locations
(Baisoara, Rosia Montana, Semenic, Ceahlau) and Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT)
located at Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos, in the Canary Islands. Long
term trends of microclimates have been compared in order to identify the
site-to-site variations. We have performed this analysis as part of a site
testing campaign aimed at finding the best location for the establishment of a
small Cherenkov telescope in Romania. The conditions at the Romanian sites have
been compared to those of the Canary Islands considered as a reference. A
statistical approach has been used for data analysis. Monthly and annual
samples have been extracted from series of raw data for nighttime, daytime and
entire day intervals. Percentage distributions of meteorological parameters,
whose values exceed certain limits, have been derived. Significant differences
have been found between the Romanian sites and the NOT site. The comparison of
the Romanian locations indicates Baisoara to be the best site for the
establishment of the telescope, closely followed by Rosia Montana. As these two
sites are both located in the Apuseni Mountains, we consider this area as the
optimal place for performing astronomical observations in Romania.

    <title>Preliminary Investigations on Uncertainty Analysis of Wind-Wave

question rises in our mind that how the accuracy of the forcing functions and
their input can affect the results. In this paper, a commonly used numerical
third generation wave model, SWAN is applied to predict waves in Lake Michigan.
Wind data were analyzed to determine wind variation frequency over Lake
Michigan. Wave predictions uncertainty due to wind local effects were compared
during a period where wind had a fairly constant speed and direction over the
northern and southern basins. The study shows that despite model calibration in
Lake Michigan area, the model deficiency arises from ignoring wind effects in
small scales. Wave prediction also emphasizes that small scale turbulence in
meteorological forces can increase error in predictions up to 35%. Wave
frequency and coherence analysis showed that both models are able to reveal the
time scale of the wave variation with same accuracy. Insufficient number of
meteorological stations can result in neglecting local wind effects and
discrepancies in current predictions. The uncertainty of wave numerical models
due to input uncertainties and model principals should be taken into account
for design risk factors.

    <title>Meteorological data for the astronomical site at Dome A, Antarctica</title>
    <summary>  We present an analysis of the meteorological data collected at Dome A,
Antarctica by the Kunlun Automated Weather Station, including temperatures and
wind speeds at eight elevations above the snow surface between 0m and 14.5m.
The average temperatures at 2m and 14.5m are $-54^{\circ}$C and $-46^{\circ}$C,
respectively. We find that a strong temperature inversion existed at all
heights for more than 70% of the time, and the temperature inversion typically
lasts longer than 25 hours, indicating an extremely stable atmosphere. The
temperature gradient is larger at lower elevations than higher elevations. The
average wind speed was 1.5m/s at 4m elevation. We find that the temperature
inversion is stronger when the wind speed is lower and the temperature gradient
decreases sharply at a specific wind speed for each elevation. The strong
temperature inversion and low wind speed results in a shallow and stable
boundary layer with weak atmospheric turbulence above it, suggesting that Dome
A should be an excellent site for astronomical observations. All the data from
the weather station are available for download.

    <title>Weather data analysis based on typical weather sequence analysis.
  Application: energy building simulation</title>
    <summary>  In building studies dealing about energy efficiency and comfort, simulation
software need relevant weather files with optimal time steps. Few tools
generate extreme and mean values of simultaneous hourly data including
correlation between the climatic parameters. This paper presents the C++
Runeole software based on typical weather sequences analysis. It runs an
analysis process of a stochastic continuous multivariable phenomenon with
frequencies properties applied to a climatic database. The database analysis
associates basic statistics, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and automatic
classifications. Different ways of applying these methods will be presented.
All the results are stored in the Runeole internal database that allows an easy
selection of weather sequences. The extreme sequences are used for system and
building sizing and the mean sequences are used for the determination of the
annual cooling loads as proposed by Audrier-Cros (Audrier-Cros, 1984). This
weather analysis was tested with the database of the French weather forecast
utility Meteo France. Reunion Island experiences a lot of different
micro-climates due to the high altitude (3069m), specific relief, and
geographic situation (Tropic of Capricorn). Furthermore Reunion Island has the
densest meteorological network in France and is an ideal place to validate the
methodology with different climates. To test the efficiency of such analysis,
simulations using the resulting weather sequences were carried out with the
building simulation software CODYRUN. This analysis is the first step of a more
global research concerning weather data generation. Future work will permit
whole hourly typical meteorological year generation using neural networks.

    <title>Predicting Whole Forest Structure, Primary Productivity, and Biomass
  Density From Maximum Tree Size and Resource Limitations</title>
    <summary>  In the face of uncertain biological response to climate change and the many
critiques concerning model complexity it is increasingly important to develop
predictive mechanistic frameworks that capture the dominant features of
ecological communities and their dependencies on environmental factors. This is
particularly important for critical global processes such as biomass changes,
carbon export, and biogenic climate feedback. Past efforts have successfully
understood a broad spectrum of plant and community traits across a range of
biological diversity and body size, including tree size distributions and
maximum tree height, from mechanical, hydrodynamic, and resource constraints.
Recently it was shown that global scaling relationships for net primary
productivity are correlated with local meteorology and the overall biomass
density within a forest. Along with previous efforts, this highlights the
connection between widely observed allometric relationships and predictive
ecology. An emerging goal of ecological theory is to gain maximum predictive
power with the least number of parameters. Here we show that the explicit
dependence of such critical quantities can be systematically predicted knowing
just the size of the largest tree. This is supported by data showing that
forests converge to our predictions as they mature. Since maximum tree size can
be calculated from local meteorology this provides a general framework for
predicting the generic structure of forests from local environmental parameters
thereby addressing a range of critical Earth-system questions.

    <title>Bivariate ensemble model output statistics approach for joint
  forecasting of wind speed and temperature</title>
    <summary>  Forecast ensembles are typically employed to account for prediction
uncertainties in numerical weather prediction models. However, ensembles often
exhibit biases and dispersion errors, thus they require statistical
post-processing to improve their predictive performance. Two popular univariate
post-processing models are the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and the ensemble
model output statistics (EMOS).
  In the last few years increased interest has emerged in developing
multivariate post-processing models, incorporating dependencies between weather
quantities, such as for example a bivariate distribution for wind vectors or
even a more general setting allowing to combine any types of weather variables.
  In line with a recently proposed approach to model temperature and wind speed
jointly by a bivariate BMA model, this paper introduces a bivariate EMOS model
for these weather quantities based on a truncated normal distribution.
  The bivariate EMOS model is applied to temperature and wind speed forecasts
of the eight-member University of Washington mesoscale ensemble and of the
eleven-member ALADIN-HUNEPS ensemble of the Hungarian Meteorological Service
and its predictive performance is compared to the performance of the bivariate
BMA model and a multivariate Gaussian copula approach, post-processing the
margins with univariate EMOS. While the predictive skills of the compared
methods are similar, the bivariate EMOS model requires considerably lower
computation times than the bivariate BMA method.

    <title>Atmospheric changes from solar eclipses</title>
    <summary>  This article reviews atmospheric changes associated with 44 solar eclipses,
beginning with the first quantitative results available, from 1834 (earlier
qualitative, accounts also exist). Eclipse meteorology attracted relatively few
publications until the total solar eclipse of 16 February 1980, with the 11
August 1999 eclipse producing the most papers. Eclipses passing over populated
areas such as Europe, China and India now regularly attract scientific
attention, whereas atmospheric measurements of eclipses at remote locations
remain rare. Many measurements and models have been used to exploit the
uniquely predictable solar forcing provided by an eclipse. In this paper we
compile the available publications and review a sub-set of them chosen on the
basis of importance and novelty. Beyond the obvious reduction in incoming solar
radiation, atmospheric cooling from eclipses can induce dynamical changes.
Observations and meteorological modelling provide evidence for the generation
of a local eclipse circulation which may be the origin of the "eclipse wind".
Gravity waves set up by the eclipse can, in principle, be detected as
atmospheric pressure fluctuations, though theoretical predictions are limited,
and many of the data are inconclusive. Eclipse events providing important early
insights into the ionisation of the upper atmosphere are also briefly reviewed.

    <title>An Arabic report about supernova SN 1006 by Ibn Sina (Avicenna)</title>
    <summary>  We present here an Arabic report about supernova 1006 (SN 1006) written by
the famous Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Lat. Avicenna, AD 980-1037), which was not
discussed in astronomical literature before. The short observational report
about a new star is part of Ibn Sina's book called al-Shifa', a work about
philosophy including physics, astronomy, and meteorology. We present the Arabic
text and our English translation. After a detailed discussion of the dating of
the observation, we show that the text specifies that the transient celestial
object was stationary and/or tail-less ("a star among the stars"), that it
"remained for close to three months getting fainter and fainter until it
disappeared", that it "threw out sparks", i.e. it was scintillating and very
bright, and that the color changed with time. The information content is
consistent with the other Arabic and non-Arabic reports about SN 1006. Hence,
it is quite clear that Ibn Sina refers to SN 1006 in his report, given as an
example for transient celestial objects in a discussion of Aristotle's
"Meteorology". Given the wording and the description, e.g. for the color
evolution, this report is independent from other reports known so far.

    <title>The Reflectivity of Mars at 1064 nm: Derivation from Mars Orbiter Laser
  Altimeter Data and Application to Climatology and Meteorology</title>
    <summary>  The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on board Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)
made $&gt; 10^{8}$ measurements of the reflectivity of Mars at 1064 nm
($R_{1064}$) by both active sounding and passive radiometry. Past studies of
$R_{1064}$ neglected the effects of atmospheric opacity and viewing geometry on
both active and passive measurements and also identified a potential
calibration issue with passive radiometry. Therefore, as yet, there exists no
acceptable reference $R_{1064}$ to derive a column opacity product for
atmospheric studies and planning future orbital lidar observations. Here, such
a reference $R_{1064}$ is derived by seeking $R^{M,N}_{1064}$: a
Minnaert-corrected normal albedo under clear conditions and assuming minimal
phase angle dependence. Over darker surfaces, $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ and the absolute
level of atmospheric opacity were estimated from active sounding. Over all
surfaces, the opacity derived from active sounding was used to exclude passive
radiometry measurements made under opaque conditions and estimate
$R^{M,N}_{1064}$. These latter estimates then were re-calibrated by comparison
with $R^{M,N}$ derived from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations over
areas of approximately uniform reflectivity. Estimates of $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ from
re-calibrated passive radiometry typically agree with HST observations within
10%. The resulting $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ is then used to derive and quantify the
uncertainties of a column opacity product, which can be applied to
meteorological and climatological studies of Mars, particularly to detect and
measure mesoscale cloud/aerosol structures.

    <title>Application of Multi-channel 3D-cube Successive Convolution Network for
  Convective Storm Nowcasting</title>
    <summary>  Convective storm nowcasting has attracted substantial attention in various
fields. Existing methods under a deep learning framework rely primarily on
radar data. Although they perform nowcast storm advection well, it is still
challenging to nowcast storm initiation and growth, due to the limitations of
the radar observations. This paper describes the first attempt to nowcast storm
initiation, growth, and advection simultaneously under a deep learning
framework using multi-source meteorological data. To this end, we present a
multi-channel 3D-cube successive convolution network (3D-SCN). As real-time
re-analysis meteorological data can now provide valuable atmospheric boundary
layer thermal dynamic information, which is essential to predict storm
initiation and growth, both raw 3D radar and re-analysis data are used directly
without any handcraft feature engineering. These data are formulated as
multi-channel 3D cubes, to be fed into our network, which are convolved by
cross-channel 3D convolutions. By stacking successive convolutional layers
without pooling, we build an end-to-end trainable model for nowcasting.
Experimental results show that deep learning methods achieve better performance
than traditional extrapolation methods. The qualitative analyses of 3D-SCN show
encouraging results of nowcasting of storm initiation, growth, and advection.

    <title>Survivability Improvement Against Earthquakes in Backbone Optical
  Networks Using Actual Seismic Zone Information</title>
    <summary>  Optical backbone networks carry a huge amount of bandwidth and serve as a key
enabling technology to provide telecommunication connectivity across the world.
Hence, in events of network component (node/link) failures, communication
networks may suffer from huge amount of bandwidth loss and service disruptions.
Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc., occur at
different places around the world, causing severe communication service
disruptions due to network component failures. Most of the previous works on
optical network survivability assume that the failures are going to occur in
future, and the network is made survivable to ensure connectivity in events of
failures. With the advancements in seismology, the predictions of earthquakes
are becoming more accurate. Earthquakes have been a major cause of
telecommunication service disruption in the past. Hence, the information
provided by the meteorological departments and other similar agencies of
different countries may be helpful in designing networks that are more robust
against earthquakes. In this work, we consider the actual information provided
by the Indian meteorological department (IMD) on seismic zones, and earthquakes
occurred in the past in India, and propose a scheme to improve the
survivability of the existing Indian optical network through minute changes in
network topology. Simulations show significant improvement in the network
survivability can be achieved using the proposed scheme in events of

    <title>Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno Working together as a Basic Meteorological
  Station</title>
    <summary>  The present paper describes a novel Raspberry Pi and Arduino UNO architecture
used as a meteorological station. One of the advantages of the proposed
architecture is the huge quantity of sensors developed for its usage;
practically one can find them for any application, and weather sensing is not
an exception. The principle followed is to configure Raspberry as a collector
for measures obtained from Arduino, transmitting occurs via USB; meanwhile,
Raspberry broadcasts them via a web page. For such activity is possible thanks
to Raspbian, a Linux-based operating system. It has a lot of libraries and
resources available, among them Apache Web Server, that gives the possibility
to host a web-page. On it, the user can observe temperature, humidity, solar
radiance, and wind speed and direction. Information on the web-page is
refreshed each five minute; however, measurements arrive at Raspberry every ten
seconds. This low refreshment rate was determined because weather variables
normally do not abruptly change. As an additional feature, system stores all
information on the log file, this gives the possibility for future analysis and
processing.

    <title>Optical Turbulence above the Internal Antarctic Plateau</title>
    <summary>  The internal antarctic plateau revealed in the last years to be a site with
interesting potentialities for the astronomical applications due to the extreme
dryness and low temperatures, the typical high altitude of the plateau, the
weak level of turbulence in the free atmosphere down to a just few tens of
meters from the ground and the thin optical turbulence layer developed at the
ground. The main goal of a site testing assessment above the internal antarctic
plateau is to characterize the site (optical turbulence and classical
meteorological parameters) and to quantify which is the gain we might obtain
with respect to equivalent astronomical observations done above mid-latitude
sites to support plans for future astronomical facilities. Our group is
involved, since a few years, in studies related to the assessment of this site
for astronomical applications that include the characterization of the
meteorological parameters and optical turbulence provided by general
circulation models as well as mesoscale atmospherical models and the
quantification of the performances of Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. In this
talk I will draw the status of art of this site assessment putting our studies
in the context of the wide international site testing activity that has been
done in Antarctica. I will focus on the site assessment relevant for
astronomical applications to be done in the visible up to the near infrared
ranges, i.e. those ranges for which the optical turbulence represents a
perturbing element for the quality of the images and the AO techniques an
efficient tool to correct these wavefront perturbations.

    <title>The Critical Richardson Number and Limits of Applicability of Local
  Similarity Theory in the Stable Boundary Layer</title>
    <summary>  Measurements of atmospheric turbulence made over the Arctic pack ice during
the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean experiment (SHEBA) are used to
determine the limits of applicability of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (in
the local scaling formulation) in the stable atmospheric boundary layer. Based
on the spectral analysis of wind velocity and air temperature fluctuations, it
is shown that, when both of the gradient Richardson number, Ri, and the flux
Richardson number, Rf, exceed a 'critical value' of about 0.20 - 0.25, the
inertial subrange associated with the Richardson-Kolmogorov cascade dies out
and vertical turbulent fluxes become small. Some small-scale turbulence
survives even in this supercritical regime, but this is non-Kolmogorov
turbulence, and it decays rapidly with further increasing stability. Similarity
theory is based on the turbulent fluxes in the high-frequency part of the
spectra that are associated with energy-containing/flux-carrying eddies.
Spectral densities in this high-frequency band diminish as the
Richardson-Kolmogorov energy cascade weakens; therefore, the applicability of
local Monin-Obukhov similarity theory in stable conditions is limited by the
inequalities Ri &lt; Ri_cr and Rf &lt; Rf_cr. However, it is found that Rf_cr = 0.20
- 0.25 is a primary threshold for applicability. Applying this prerequisite
shows that the data follow classical Monin-Obukhov local z-less predictions
after the irrelevant cases (turbulence without the Richardson-Kolmogorov
cascade) have been filtered out.

    <title>Doppler Signatures of the Atmospheric Circulation on Hot Jupiters</title>
    <summary>  The meteorology of hot Jupiters has been characterized primarily with thermal
measurements, but recent observations suggest the possibility of directly
detecting the winds by observing the Doppler shift of spectral lines seen
during transit. Motivated by these observations, we show how Doppler
measurements can place powerful constraints on the meteorology. We show that
the atmospheric circulation--and Doppler signature--of hot Jupiters splits into
two regimes. Under weak stellar insolation, the day-night thermal forcing
generates fast zonal jet streams from the interaction of atmospheric waves with
the mean flow. In this regime, air along the terminator (as seen during
transit) flows toward Earth in some regions and away from Earth in others,
leading to a Doppler signature exhibiting superposed blueshifted and redshifted
components. Under intense stellar insolation, however, the strong thermal
forcing damps these planetary-scale waves, inhibiting their ability to generate
jets. Strong frictional drag likewise damps these waves and inhibits jet
formation. As a result, this second regime exhibits a circulation dominated by
high-altitude, day-to-night airflow, leading to a predominantly blueshifted
Doppler signature during transit. We present state-of-the-art circulation
models including nongray radiative transfer to quantify this regime shift and
the resulting Doppler signatures; these models suggest that cool planets like
GJ 436b lie in the first regime, HD 189733b is transitional, while planets
hotter than HD 209458b lie in the second regime. Moreover, we show how the
amplitude of the Doppler shifts constrains the strength of frictional drag in
the upper atmospheres of hot Jupiters. If due to winds, the ~2-km/sec blueshift
inferred on HD 209458b may require drag time constants as short as 10^4-10^6
seconds, possibly the result of Lorentz-force braking on this planet's hot
dayside.

    <title>MOSE: a feasibility study for optical turbulence forecasts with the
  Meso-Nh mesoscale model to support AO facilities at ESO sites (Paranal and
  Armazones)</title>
    <summary>  We present very encouraging preliminary results obtained in the context of
the MOSE project, an on-going study aiming at investigating the feasibility of
the forecast of the optical turbulence and meteorological parameters (in the
free atmosphere as well as in the boundary and surface layer) at Cerro Paranal
(site of the Very Large Telescope - VLT) and Cerro Armazones (site of the
European Extremely Large Telescope - E-ELT), both in Chile. The study employs
the Meso-Nh atmospheric mesoscale model and aims at supplying a tool for
optical turbulence forecasts to support the scheduling of the scientific
programs and the use of AO facilities at the VLT and the E-ELT. In this study
we take advantage of the huge amount of measurements performed so far at
Paranal and Armazones by ESO and the TMT consortium in the context of the site
selection for the E-ELT and the TMT to constraint/validate the model. A
detailed analysis of the model performances in reproducing the atmospheric
parameters (T, V, p, H, ...) near the ground as well as in the free atmosphere,
is critical and fundamental because the optical turbulence depends on most of
these parameters. This approach permits us to provide an exhaustive and
complete analysis of the model performances and to better define the model
operational application. This also helps us to identify the sources of
discrepancies with optical turbulence measurements (when they appear) and to
discriminate between different origins of the problem: model parameterization,
initial conditions, ... Preliminary results indicate a great accuracy of the
model in reproducing most of the main meteorological parameters in statistical
terms as well as in each individual night in the free atmosphere and in
proximity of the surface. The study is co-funded by ESO and INAF-Arcetri
(Italy).

    <title>Meteorology of Jupiter's Equatorial Hot Spots and Plumes from Cassini</title>
    <summary>  We present an updated analysis of Jupiter's equatorial meteorology from
Cassini observations. For two months preceding the spacecraft's closest
approach, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) onboard regularly imaged the
atmosphere. We created time-lapse movies from this period in order to analyze
the dynamics of equatorial hot spots and their interactions with adjacent
latitudes. Hot spots are quasi-stable, rectangular dark areas on
visible-wavelength images, with defined eastern edges that sharply contrast
with surrounding clouds, but diffuse western edges serving as nebulous
boundaries with adjacent equatorial plumes. Hot spots exhibit significant
variations in size and shape over timescales of days and weeks. Some of these
changes correspond with passing vortex systems from adjacent latitudes
interacting with hot spots. Strong anticyclonic gyres present to the south and
southeast of the dark areas appear to circulate into hot spots. Impressive,
bright white plumes occupy spaces in between hot spots. Compact cirrus-like
'scooter' clouds flow rapidly through the plumes before disappearing within the
dark areas. These clouds travel at 150-200 m/s, much faster than the 100 m/s
hot spot and plume drift speed. This raises the possibility that the scooter
clouds may be more illustrative of the actual jet stream speed at these
latitudes. Most previously published zonal wind profiles represent the drift
speed of the hot spots at their latitude from pattern matching of the entire
longitudinal image strip. If a downward branch of an equatorially-trapped
Rossby waves controls the overall appearance of hot spots, however, the
westward phase velocity of the wave leads to underestimates of the true jet
stream speed.

    <title>An Environmental Watch System for the Andean countries: El Observatorio
  Andino</title>
    <summary>  An experimental Environmental Watch System, the so-called Observatorio
Andino-OA (Observatorio Andino), has been implemented in Venezuela, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile over the past two years. The OA is a
collaborative and regional network that aims to monitor several environmental
variables and develop accurate forecasts based on different scientific tools.
Its overall goal is to improve risk assessments, set up Early Warning Systems,
support decision-making processes, and provide easily- and
intuitively-understandable spatial maps to end-users. The initiative works
under the scientific and logistic coordination of the Centro de Modelado
Cient\'ifico (CMC) at Zulia University, Venezuela, and the Centro Internacional
para la Investigaci\'on del Fen\'omeno 'El Ni\~no' (CIIFEN), and is operated at
a local level by the National Weather Services (NWSs) of the aforementioned six
Andean nations. The OA provides several freely-available model outputs
including meteorological and hydrological forecasts, droughts, fire and flood
indices, ecosystems dynamics, climate and health applications, and five-day
high-resolution oceanographic predictions for the Eastern Pacific. This article
briefly describes the current products, methodologies and dynamical and
statistical modeling outputs provided by the OA. Also, a discussion on how
these sets of tools have been put together as a coordinated, scientific watch
and forecast system for each country and for the entire region is presented.
Our experiences over the past two years suggest that this initiative would
significantly improve the current decision-making processes in Andean
countries.

    <title>Shootout-89: A Comparative Evaluation of Knowledge-based Systems that
  Forecast Severe Weather</title>
    <summary>  During the summer of 1989, the Forecast Systems Laboratory of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sponsored an evaluation of artificial
intelligence-based systems that forecast severe convective storms. The
evaluation experiment, called Shootout-89, took place in Boulder, and focussed
on storms over the northeastern Colorado foothills and plains (Moninger, et
al., 1990). Six systems participated in Shootout-89. These included traditional
expert systems, an analogy-based system, and a system developed using methods
from the cognitive science/judgment analysis tradition. Each day of the
exercise, the systems generated 2 to 9 hour forecasts of the probabilities of
occurrence of: non significant weather, significant weather, and severe
weather, in each of four regions in northeastern Colorado. A verification
coordinator working at the Denver Weather Service Forecast Office gathered
ground-truth data from a network of observers. Systems were evaluated on the
basis of several measures of forecast skill, and on other metrics such as
timeliness, ease of learning, and ease of use. Systems were generally easy to
operate, however the various systems required substantially different levels of
meteorological expertise on the part of their users--reflecting the various
operational environments for which the systems had been designed. Systems
varied in their statistical behavior, but on this difficult forecast problem,
the systems generally showed a skill approximately equal to that of persistence
forecasts and climatological (historical frequency) forecasts. The two systems
that appeared best able to discriminate significant from non significant
weather events were traditional expert systems. Both of these systems required
the operator to make relatively sophisticated meteorological judgments. We are
unable, based on only one summer's worth of data, to determine the extent to
which the greater skill of the two systems was due to the content of their
knowledge bases, or to the subjective judgments of the operator. A follow-on
experiment, Shootout-91, is currently being planned. Interested potential
participants are encouraged to contact the author at the address above.

    <title>Covariant Lyapunov Vectors of a Quasi-geostrophic Baroclinic Model:
  Analysis of Instabilities and Feedbacks</title>
    <summary>  The classical approach for studying atmospheric variability is based on
defining a background state and studying the linear stability of the small
fluctuations around such a state. Weakly non-linear theories can be constructed
using higher order expansions terms. While these methods have undoubtedly great
value for elucidating the relevant physical processes, they are unable to
follow the dynamics of a turbulent atmosphere. We provide a first example of
extension of the classical stability analysis to a non-linearly evolving
quasi-geostrophic flow. The so-called covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) provide
a covariant basis describing the directions of exponential expansion and decay
of perturbations to the non-linear trajectory of the flow. We use such a
formalism to re-examine the basic barotropic and baroclinic processes of the
atmosphere with a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane two-layer model in a periodic
channel driven by a forced meridional temperature gradient $\Delta T$. We
explore three settings of $\Delta T$, representative of relatively weak
turbulence, well-developed turbulence, and intermediate conditions. We
construct the Lorenz energy cycle for each CLV describing the energy exchanges
with the background state. A positive baroclinic conversion rate is a necessary
but not sufficient condition of instability. Barotropic instability is present
only for few very unstable CLVs for large values of $\Delta T$. Slowly growing
and decaying hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes closely mirror the properties of the
background flow. Following classical necessary conditions for
barotropic/baroclinic instability, we find a clear relationship between the
properties of the eddy fluxes of a CLV and its instability. CLVs with positive
baroclinic conversion seem to form a set of modes for constructing a reduced
model of the atmosphere dynamics.

    <title>Photometric transit search for planets around cool stars from the
  Western Italian Alps: a site characterization study</title>
    <summary>  We present the results of a site characterization study carried out at the
Astronomical Observatory of the Autonomous Region of the Aosta Valley (OAVdA),
in the Western Italian Alps, aimed at establishing its potential to host a
photometric transit search for small-size planets around a statistically
significant sample of nearby cool M dwarfs. [abridged] we gauged site-dependent
observing conditions such as night-sky brightness, photometric precision, and
seeing properties. Public meteorological data were also used in order to help
in the determination of the actual number of useful observing nights per year.
The measured zenithal $V$-band night-sky brightness is typical of that of very
good, very dark observing sites. The extinction registered at $V$ band is not
dissimilar from that of other sites. The median seeing over the period of in
situ observations is found to be $\sim1.7^{\prime\prime}$. Given the limited
duration of the observations, we did not probe any possible seeing seasonal
patterns, or the details of its possible dependence on other meteorological
parameters, such as wind speed and direction. Moreover, our data show that the
seeing at the observatory was reasonably stable during most of the nights. The
fraction of fully clear nights per year amounts to 39\%, while the total of
useful nights increases to 57\% assuming a (conservative) cloud cover of not
more than 50\% of the night. Based on the analysis of photometric data
collected over the period May-August 2009 for three stellar fields centered on
the transiting planet hosts WASP-3, HAT-P-7, and Gliese 436, we achieve
seeing-independent best-case photometric precision
$\sigma_\mathrm{ph}\lesssim3$ mmag (rms) in several nights for bright stars
($R\lesssim 11$ mag). A median performance $\sigma_\mathrm{ph}\sim6$ mmag
during the observing period is obtained for stars with $R\lesssim13$ mag.

    <title>On the concept of pseudo-energy of T. G. Shepherd. A close link with
  exergy functions</title>
    <summary>  Shepherd (1993) derived a general expression for the available potential
energy for compressible, hydrostatic flow, where the sum of this available
energy and the kinetic energy is called pseudo-energy. He demonstrated that for
a special basic state the small-amplitude limit of the generalized available
potential energy reduces to the well-known approximate form of Lorenz (1955)
expressed in a pressure vertical coordinate.
  Other forms of available energies exist in atmospheric energetics and in
thermodynamics, where the name exergy has been coined by Rant (1956) to denote
the maximum work that can be extracted from any system when it is subject to
some constraints (adiabatic transformations or constant total energy for
instance).
  The purpose of this note is to show that the specific available enthalpy
function denoted by $a_h = (h - h_r) - T_r \: (s - s_r)$ in Marquet (1991) can
be obtained from the generalized approach of Shepherd for another basic state.
This special form of pseudo-energy also leads to the global hydrostatic
concepts of Dutton (1973) and Pichler (1977). The function $a_h$ only depends
on the specific enthalpy $h$ and entropy $s$ at any point, the values $h_r$ and
$s_r$ refer to the special dead state at temperature $T_r$ and pressure $p_r$.
  It is explained that for another choice of the basic state, the generalized
expression of Shepherd reduces with a good accuracy to the approximate
functions introduced by Pearce (1978) or Blackburn (1983) in meteorology and
Thomson (1853, Lord Kelvin) in thermodynamics.

    <title>Structure of Turbulence in Katabatic Flows below and above the
  Wind-Speed Maximum</title>
    <summary>  Measurements of small-scale turbulence made over the complex-terrain
atmospheric boundary layer during the MATERHORN Program are used to describe
the structure of turbulence in katabatic flows. Turbulent and mean
meteorological data were continuously measured at multiple levels at four
towers deployed along the East lower slope (2-4 deg) of Granite Mountain. The
multi-level observations made during a 30-day long MATERHORN-Fall field
campaign in September-October 2012 allowed studying of temporal and spatial
structure of katabatic flows in detail, and herein we report turbulence and
their variations in katabatic winds. Observed vertical profiles show steep
gradients near the surface, but in the layer above the slope jet the vertical
variability is smaller. It is found that the vertical (normal to the slope)
momentum flux and horizontal (along the slope) heat flux in a slope-following
coordinate system change their sign below and above the wind maximum of a
katabatic flow. The vertical momentum flux is directed downward (upward)
whereas the horizontal heat flux is downslope (upslope) below (above) the wind
maximum. Our study therefore suggests that the position of the jet-speed
maximum can be obtained by linear interpolation between positive and negative
values of the momentum flux (or the horizontal heat flux) to derive the height
where flux becomes zero. It is shown that the standard deviations of all wind
speed components (therefore the turbulent kinetic energy) and the dissipation
rate of turbulent kinetic energy have a local minimum, whereas the standard
deviation of air temperature has an absolute maximum at the height of
wind-speed maximum. We report several cases where the vertical and horizontal
heat fluxes are compensated. Turbulence above the wind-speed maximum is
decoupled from the surface, and follows the classical local z-less predictions
for stably stratified boundary layer.

    <title>Dynamical Analysis of Blocking Events: Spatial and Temporal Fluctuations
  of Covariant Lyapunov Vectors</title>
    <summary>  One of the most relevant weather regimes in the mid-latitudes atmosphere is
the persistent deviation from the approximately zonally symmetric jet to the
emergence of blocking patterns. Such configurations are usually connected to
exceptional local stability properties of the flow which come along with an
improved local forecast skills during the phenomenon. It is instead extremely
hard to predict onset and decay of blockings. Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs)
offer a suitable characterization of the linear stability of a chaotic flow,
since they represent the full tangent linear dynamics by a covariant basis
which explores linear perturbations at all time scales. Therefore, we assess
whether CLVs feature a signature of the blockings. As a first step, we examine
the CLVs for a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane 2-layer model in a periodic channel
baroclinically driven by a meridional temperature gradient $\Delta T$. An
orographic forcing enhances the emergence of localized blocked regimes. We
detect the blocking events with a Tibaldi-Molteni scheme adapted to the
periodic channel. When blocking occurs, the global growth rates of the fastest
growing CLVs are significantly higher. Hence, against intuition, the
circulation is globally more unstable in blocked phases. Such an increase in
the finite time Lyapunov exponents with respect to the long term average is
attributed to stronger barotropic and baroclinic conversion in the case of high
temperature gradients, while for low values of \Delta T, the effect is only due
to stronger barotropic instability. In order to determine the localization of
the CLVs we compare the meridionally averaged variance of the CLVs during
blocked and unblocked phases. We find that on average the variance of the CLVs
is clustered around the center of blocking. These results show that the blocked
flow affects all time scales and processes described by the CLVs.

    <title>Sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide as inorganic carbon in the
  unsaturated zone under semi-arid forests</title>
    <summary>  Inorganic carbon, in the form of allogenic (transported) and pedogenic (soil)
carbonates in semi-arid soils, may comprise an important carbon sink. Carbon
dioxide, CO2, originating from the atmosphere and exhaled by tree roots into
the soil, may be hydrated by soil water within the unsaturated zone (USZ) of
semi-arid soils to produce the carbonic acid (H2CO3) solutes HCO3- bicarbonate
and H+ Hydrogen ion. This H+ may then dissolve relict soil CaCO3 carbonate
(calcite), to release Ca+2 calcium cations and more HCO3- bicarbonate. When
conditions allow, one mole of Ca+2 and two moles of HCO3- combine to
precipitate one mole of calcite, and to release one mole of CO2: Ca+2 + 2HCO3-
--&gt; CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O. However, it has been claimed that such carbonates do not
sequester significant amounts of present day atmospheric CO2. The reasons given
were that they originate in part from the pre-existing limestone; and that for
every mole of calcite precipitated, one mole of CO2 may be liberated to the
atmosphere. It was argued that only if the Ca+2 cation is derived from a
non-carbonate source can sequestration be assumed. We have tested these
assumptions under field conditions at two semi-arid sites in Israel. We found
that bicarbonate, originating from root exhalation, is depleted and is
incorporated within the USZ as carbonates precipitate. Thus, a net
sequestration of atmospheric CO2 does occur under semi-arid forests. Moreover,
most of the CO2 liberated in the precipitation reaction may remain in the soil.
And Ca+2 in the sediment may also be supplied from sources other than
pre-existing calcite. Forestation can therefore augment pedogenic carbonate
formation. By extrapolating our data globally, we suggest that worldwide
semi-arid forests (existing and to be planted) may sequester 5-20% of the
current annual anthropogenic increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide as
pedogenic carbonate.

    <title>Concurrent risks of dam failure due to internal degradation, strong
  winds, snow and drought</title>
    <summary>  The chance (or probability) of a dam failure can change for various reasons
such as structural degradation, the impacts of climate change and land-use
change. Similarly the consequences of dam failure (flooding) can change for
many reasons such as growth in the population in areas below a dam.
Consequently both the chance that a dam might fail and the likely consequences
of that failure can change over time. It is therefore crucial that reservoir
safety risk analysis methods and decision-making processes are able to support
(as a minimum) what-if testing (or sensitivity testing) to take into account
these changes over time to gauge their effect on the estimated risk of dam
failure. The consequences of a dam failure relate to the vulnerability and
exposure of the receptors (for example, people, property and environment) to
floodwater. Also the probability of dam failure varies with age, design and
construction of the dam. Spillway failure may be caused by the dissipation of
energy from water flowing down the spillway, and embankment erosion (scour) may
be caused by a dam overtopping. The occurrence of these events depends upon the
dam design and the likelihood of extreme rainfall, also in the case of
overtopping wind-driven waves on the reservoir surface. In this study the
meteorological situations of notable recent events i.e. the Boltby, North
Yorkshire incident, 19 June 2005 in which the dam almost overtopped, and the
spillway failure of the Ulley Dam near Rotherham at the end of June 2007, are
studied. The WRF numerical model will be used to indicate how these
meteorological situations might be maximized, and be coupled with the
occurrence of other failure modes such as the likelihood of internal dam
failure assessed from previous work by government panel engineers.

    <title>Search for Astronomical Sites in Developing Countries and their
  Preventive Protection</title>
    <summary>  The archives of meteorological satellites permit to find around the world dry
sites well adapted to astronomical observations (in the visible, IR, and
millimetric ranges), as a pre-selection of sites. The GSM (Grating Scale
Monitor) technique permits to qualify some of them as astronomical sites for a
future setting-up of astronomical observatories. Such sites are found in new
astronomical countries or in Developing Countries. At the same time, their
preventive protection from light pollution and/or radio interference has to be
viewed. In practice, once the pre-selection is made, the government of these
countries ought to be alerted for example by IAU and/or UN Office for Outer
Space Affairs. The local site testing through GSM should be carried out in
cooperation with astronomers or scientists of these countries under the
umbrella of IAU. This should be an approach to help to introduce astronomy and
astrophysics in Developing Countries.

    <title>The artificial night sky brightness mapped from DMSP Operational
  Linescan System measurements</title>
    <summary>  We present a method to map the artificial sky brightness across large
territories in astronomical photometric bands with a resolution of
approximately 1 km. This is useful to quantify the situation of night sky
pollution, to recognize potential astronomical sites and to allow future
monitoring of trends. The artificial sky brightness present in the chosen
direction at a given position on the Earth's surface is obtained by the
integration of the contributions produced by every surface area in the
surrounding. Each contribution is computed based on detailed models for the
propagation in the atmosphere of the upward light flux emitted by the area. The
light flux is measured with top of atmosphere radiometric observations made by
the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan
System.
  We applied the described method to Europe obtaining the maps of artificial
sky brightness in V and B bands.

    <title>Astronomical Seeing from the Summits of the Antarctic Plateau</title>
    <summary>  From the South Pole, microthermal turbulence within a narrow surface boundary
layer some 200m thick provides the dominant contribution to the astronomical
seeing. We present results for the seeing at a wavelength of 2.4um. The narrow
turbulence layer above the site, confined close to the surface, provides
greatly superior conditions for adaptive optics correction than do temperate
latitude sites. An analysis of the available meteorological data for the
Antarctic plateau suggests that sites on its summit, such as Domes A and C,
probably experience significantly better boundary layer seeing than does the
South Pole. In addition, the inversion layers may be significantly narrower,
lending the sites even further to adaptive optics correction than does the
Pole.

    <title>New subdwarf B star periods</title>
    <summary>  Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are thought to be helium burning stars with low mass
hydrogen envelopes. Several evolutionary paths have been proposed to explain
the formation of these systems. One of these scenarios is the evolution of the
sdB progenitor within a binary system. We have looked systematically at bright
sdB stars from the PG survey. By taking spectra at several different epochs we
have measured the radial velocity shifts caused by the motion of the sdB star
within the binary. Our data have been taken over a long time base line (2
years) which allowed us to find longer period binaries than known before. Here
we present results for 29 sdB systems.

    <title>Impact of Varying Atmospheric Profiles on Extensive Air Shower
  Observation: - Atmospheric Density and Primary Mass Reconstruction -</title>
    <summary>  The longitudinal profile of extensive air showers is sensitive to the energy
and type/mass of the primary particle. One of its characteristics, the
atmospheric depth of shower maximum, is often used to reconstruct the elemental
composition of primary cosmic rays. In this article, the impact of the
atmospheric density profile on the reconstruction of the depth of maximum, as
observed in fluorescence light measurements, is investigated. We consider in
detail the atmospheric density profile and its time variations at the site of
the southern Pierre Auger Observatory, using data that were obtained from
meteorological radio soundings. Similar atmospheric effects are expected to be
found also at other sites.

    <title>Atmospheric Profiles at the Southern Pierre Auger Observatory and their
  Relevance to Air Shower Measurement</title>
    <summary>  The dependence of atmospheric conditions on altitude and time have to be
known at the site of an air shower experiment for accurate reconstruction of
extensive air showers and their simulations. The height-profile of atmospheric
depth is of particular interest as it enters directly into the reconstruction
of longitudinal shower development and of the primary energy and mass of cosmic
rays. For the southern part of the Auger Observatory, the atmosphere has been
investigated in a number of campaigns with meteorological radio soundings and
with continuous measurements of ground-based weather stations. Focussing on
atmospheric depth and temperature profiles, temporal variations are described
and monthly profiles are developed. Uncertainties of the monthly atmospheres
that are currently applied in the Auger reconstruction are discussed.

    <title>Tracing of Error in a Time Series Data</title>
    <summary>  A physical (e.g. astrophysical, geophysical, meteorological etc.) data may
appear as an output of an experiment or it may contain some sociological,
economic or biological information. Whatever be the source of a time series
data some amount of noise is always expected to be embedded in it. Analysis of
such data in presence of noise may often fail to give accurate information.
Although text book data filtering theory is primarily concerned with the
presences of random, zero mean errors; but in reality, errors in data are often
systematic rather than random. In the present paper we produce different models
of systematic error in the time series data. This will certainly help to trace
the systematic error present in the data and consequently that can be removed
as possible to make the data compatible for further study.

    <title>An Adaptive Approach to Filter a Time Series Data</title>
    <summary>  A physical data (such as astrophysical, geophysical, meteorological etc.) may
appear as an output of an experiment or it may come out as a signal from a
dynamical system or it may contain some sociological, economic or biological
information. Whatever be the source of a time series data some amount of noise
is always expected to be embedded in it. Analysis of such data in presence of
noise may often fail to give accurate information. The method of filtering a
time series data is a tool to clean these errors as possible as we can just to
make the data compatible for further analysis. Here we made an attempt to
develop an adaptive approach of filtering a time series and we have shown
analytically that the present model can fight against the propagation of error
and can maintain the positional importance in the time series very efficiently.

    <title>El Roque de Los Muchachos Site Characteristics. II. Analysis of Wind,
  Relative Humidity and Air Pressure</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we present an analysis of wind speed, wind direction, relative
humidity and air pressure taken at TNG, CAMC and NOT at Observatorio del Roque
de Los Muchachos, in the Canary Islands. Data are compared in order to check
local variations and both long term and short term trends of the microclimate.
Furthermore, influence of wind speed on the astronomical seeing is estimated to
the aim to better understand the influence of wide scale parameters on local
meteorological data. The three telescopes show different prevailing wind
direction, wind speed, relative humidity and air pressure confirming
differences in local microclimate. We found that seeing deteriorates when wind
speed is lower than 3.3 m/s. Comparison in terms of wind speed and high
relative humidity (&gt; 90%) shows that TNG seems to have optimal observational
conditions with respect to CAMC and NOT. Air pressure analysis shows that ORM
is dominated by high pressure. Short time variations of pressure anticipate
temperature variations tipically by 2-3 hours, this property vanishes in time
scales higher than some hours and disappear in longer time scales.

    <title>Prediction Errors and Local Lyapunov Exponents</title>
    <summary>  It is frequently asserted that in a chaotic system two initially close points
will separate at an exponential rate governed by the largest global Lyapunov
exponent. Local Lyapunov exponents, however, are more directly relevant to
predictability. The difference between the local and global Lyapunov exponents,
the large variations of local exponents over an attractor, and the saturation
of error growth near the size of the attractor---all result in non-exponential
scalings in errors at both short and long prediction times, sometimes even
obscuring evidence of exponential growth. Failure to observe exponential error
scaling cannot rule out deterministic chaos as an explanation. We demonstrate a
simple model that quantitatively predicts observed error scaling from the local
Lyapunov exponents, for both short and surprisingly long times. We comment on
the relevance to atmospheric predictability as studied in the meteorological
literature.

    <title>Universal Spectrum for Interannual Variability of Rainfall Over India
  and Scotland: Implication for Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric flows exhibit fluctuations of all scales (space -time) ranging
from turbulence (millimeters-seconds) to climate (thousands of
kilometers-years). The apparently random fluctuations however exhibit
long-range spatio-temporal correlations manifested as the selfsimilar fractal
geometry to the global cloud cover pattern concomitant with inverse power law
form for power spectra of temporal fluctuations . Long-range spatiotemporal
correlations are ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature and are recently
identified as signatures of self-organized criticality . Traditional
meteorological theory cannot explain satisfactorily the observed selforganized
criticality in atmospheric flows . This paper gives a summary of an alternative
non-deterministic cell dynamical systems model for atmospheric flows which
predicts the observed self-organized criticality as intrinsic to quantumlike
mechanics governing flow dynamics.

    <title>Enhancement in Surface Atmospheric Pressure Variability Associated with
  a Major Geomagnetic Storm</title>
    <summary>  Observational studies indicate that there is a close association between
geomagnetic storm and meteorological parameters. Geomagnetic field lines follow
closely the isobars of surface pressure . A Physical mechanism linking upper
atmospheric geomagnetic storm disturbances with tropospheric weather has been
proposed by the author and her group where it is postulated that vertical
mixing by turbulent eddy fluctuations results in the net transport upward of
positive charges originating from lower levels accompanied simultaneously by
downward flow of negative charges from higher levels. The present study reports
enhancement of high frequency (&lt;15 days period) fluctuations in daily surface
pressure during March 1989 in association with major geomagnetic storm (Ap
index = 246) on 13 march 1989.

    <title>Random dynamical systems, entropies and information</title>
    <summary>  Prediction of events is the challenge in many different disciplines, from
meteorology to finance; the more this task is difficult, the more a system is
{\it complex}. Nevertheless, even according to this restricted definition, a
general consensus on what should be the correct indicator for complexity is
still not reached. In particular, this characterization is still lacking for
systems whose time evolution is influenced by factors which are not under
control and appear as random parameters or random noise. We show in this paper
how to find the correct indicators for complexity in the information theory
context. The crucial point is that the answer is twofold depending on the fact
that the random parameters are measurable or not. The content of this
apparently trivial observation has been often ignored in literature leading to
paradoxical results. Predictability is obviously larger when the random
parameters are measurable, nevertheless, in the contrary case, predictability
improves when the unknown random parameters are time correlated.

    <title>Detecting nonlinearity in multivariate time series</title>
    <summary>  We propose an extension to time series with several simultaneously measured
variables of the nonlinearity test, which combines the redundancy -- linear
redundancy approach with the surrogate data technique. For several variables
various types of the redundancies can be defined, in order to test specific
dependence structures between/among (groups of) variables. The null hypothesis
of a multivariate linear stochastic process is tested using the multivariate
surrogate data. The linear redundancies are used in order to avoid spurious
results due to imperfect surrogates. The method is demonstrated using two types
of numerically generated multivariate series (linear and nonlinear) and
experimental multivariate data from meteorology and physiology.

    <title>Some Statistical Physics Approaches for Trends and Predictions in
  Meteorology</title>
    <summary>  Specific aspects of time series analysis are discussed. They are related to
the analysis of atmospheric data that are pertinent to clouds. A brief
introduction on some of the most interesting topics of current research on
climate/weather predictions is given. Scaling properties of the liquid water
path in stratus clouds are analyzed to demonstrate the application of several
methods of statistical physics for analyzing data in atmospheric sciences, and
more generally in geophysics. The breaking up of a stratus cloud is shown to be
related to changes in the type of correlations in the fluctuations of the
signal that represents the total vertical amount of liquid water in the stratus
cloud. It is demonstrated that the correlations of the liquid water path
fluctuations exist indeed in a more complex way than usually known through
their multi-affine dependence.

    <title>Statistical Derivation of the Evolution Equation of Liquid Water Path
  Fluctuations in Clouds</title>
    <summary>  How to distinguish and quantify deterministic and random influences on the
statistics of turbulence data in meteorology cases is discussed from first
principles. Liquid water path (LWP) changes in clouds, as retrieved from radio
signals, upon different delay times, can be regarded as a stochastic Markov
process. A detrended fluctuation analysis method indicates the existence of
long range time correlations. The Fokker-Planck equation which models very
precisely the LWP $fluctuation$ empirical probability distributions, in
particular, their non-Gaussian heavy tails is explicitly derived and written in
terms of a drift and a diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, Kramers-Moyal
coefficients, as estimated from the empirical data, are found to be in good
agreement with their first principle derivation. Finally, the equivalent
Langevin equation is written for the LWP increments themselves. Thus rather
than the existence of hierarchical structures, like an energy cascade process,
{\it strong correlations} on different $time$ $scales$, from small to large
ones, are considered to be proven as intrinsic ingredients of such cloud
evolutions.

    <title>Trajectory end point distribution of a test particle in the atmosphere</title>
    <summary>  The classic meteorological law of diffusion in the atmosphere was given
experimentally, by Richardson in 1926, whose result that the mean squared
distance &lt;R^2&gt;=cT^3, the time cubed, is in accord with the scaling theory of
Komogorov [ Obukhov (1941)]. In some cases it might be important to have more
information than that provided by Richardson's law. An example would be the
distribution of pollutants in time by turbulent flow. Here small amounts of
material reaching relatively large distances are of importance. This motivates
our interest in the full distribution of the location of particles swept by the
fluid as a function of time. The distribution depends on the distance through
the dimensionless quantity X^2=R^2/&lt;R^2(T)&gt; . Using the Kolmogorov picture, we
find that for small X, the distribution is proportional to exp(-aX^2) and
exp(-bX^4/3) at its tail when X is large.

    <title>Effect of substrate-induced strain on transport and magnetic properties
  of epitaxial La_0.66Sr_0.33MnO_3 thin films</title>
    <summary>  We have studied electrical transport and magnetic properties of epitaxial
La_0.66 Sr_0.33 Mn O_3 thin films grown on different substrates having
different lattice strains induced by different film-substrate lattice-mismatch.
Both electrical transport and magnetic properties exhibit strong correlation
with Jahn-Teller strain. Our study shows a sufficiently large Jahn-Teller
strain giving rise to distinct semi-conducting/insulating state in LSMO thin
films even below the respective para-ferromagnetic Curie temperatutes Tc, which
is in contradiction with the established phase diagram of Sr-doped manganites.
We have presented a microscopic model for the analysis of our data instead of
the usual expansion around the undistorted state generally in use in the
literature. The model incorporates the two relevant e_g orbitals (and their
ordering thereof) and the effect of both Jahn-Teller and bulk strain on the
transition temperature via double exchange.

    <title>An agent-based intelligent environmental monitoring system</title>
    <summary>  Fairly rapid environmental changes call for continuous surveillance and
on-line decision making. There are two main areas where IT technologies can be
valuable. In this paper we present a multi-agent system for monitoring and
assessing air-quality attributes, which uses data coming from a meteorological
station. A community of software agents is assigned to monitor and validate
measurements coming from several sensors, to assess air-quality, and, finally,
to fire alarms to appropriate recipients, when needed. Data mining techniques
have been used for adding data-driven, customized intelligence into agents. The
architecture of the developed system, its domain ontology, and typical agent
interactions are presented. Finally, the deployment of a real-world test case
is demonstrated.

    <title>A Solar System Test of Mach's Principle with Gravimetric Data</title>
    <summary>  We present a new test for a possible Mach-Sciama dependence of the
Gravitational constant G. According to Ernst Mach (1838-1916), the
gravitational interaction depends on the distribution of masses in the
universe. A corresponding hypothesis of Sciama (1953) on the gravitational
constant, $c^2/G = \sum m_i/r_i$, can be tested since the elliptic earth orbit
should then cause minute annual variations in G. The test is performed by
analyzing the gravity signals of a network of superconducting gravimeters (SG)
which reach a precision of $10^{-10} m/s^2$. After reducing the signal by
modelling tidal, meteorologic and geophysical effects, no significant evidence
for the above dependence is found.

    <title>The metron model. Towards a unified deterministic theory of fields and
  particles</title>
    <summary>  A conceptual summary is given of a deterministic unified field and particle
theory (the metron model) developed in more mathematical detail in a four-part
paper published in Physics Essays (1996/97). The model is developed from
Einsteins vacuum gravitational equations, Ricci tensor $R_{LM}=0$, in a higher
dimensional space. It is postulated that the equations support soliton-type
solutions (metrons) which reproduce all the basic field equations of quantum
field theory, including not only the Maxwell-Dirac-Einstein system, but also
all fields and symmetries of the Standard Model. Bell's theorem on the
non-existence of hidden-variable models of quantum phenomena is circumvented
through the time-reversal symmetry of all interactions on microphysical scales.
The model, when completed, should yield all particle properties and universal
physical constants from first principles.

    <title>Levy-Kolmogorov scaling of turbulence</title>
    <summary>  The Kolmogorov scaling law of turbulences has been considered the most
important theoretical breakthrough in the last century. It is an essential
approach to analyze turbulence data present in meteorological, physical,
chemical, biological and mechanical phenomena. One of its very fundamental
assumptions is that turbulence is a stochastic Gaussian process in small
scales5. However, experiment data at finite Reynolds numbers have observed a
clear departure from the Gaussian. In this study, by replacing the standard
Laplacian representation of dissipation in the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation with
the fractional Laplacian, we obtain the fractional NS equation underlying the
Levy stable distribution which exhibits a non-Gaussian heavy trail and
fractional frequency power law dissipation. The dimensional analysis of this
equation turns out a new scaling of turbulences, called the Levy-Kolmogorov
scaling, whose scaling exponent ranges from -3 to -5/3 corresponding to
different Levy processes and reduces to the limiting Kolmogorov scaling -5/3
underlying a Gaussian process. The truncated Levy process and multi-scaling due
to the boundary effect is also discussed. Finally, we further extend our model
to reflecting the history-dependent fractional Brownian motion.

    <title>A Model of Intra-seasonal Oscillations in the Earth atmosphere</title>
    <summary>  We suggest a way of rationalizing an intra-seasonal oscillations (IOs) of the
Earth atmospheric flow as four meteorological relevant triads of interacting
planetary waves, isolated from the system of all the rest planetary waves.
  Our model is independent of the topography (mountains, etc.) and gives a
natural explanation of IOs both in the North and South Hemispheres. Spherical
planetary waves are an example of a wave mesoscopic system obeying discrete
resonances that also appears in other areas of physics.

    <title>Predictability of El Niño as a Nonlinear Stochastic Limit Cycle</title>
    <summary>  The El Ni\~no phenomenon, synonymously El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
is an anomalous climatic oscillation in the Equatorial Pacific that occurs once
every 3-8 years. It affects the earth's climate on a global scale. Whether it
is a cyclic or a sporadic event, or whether its apparently random behaviour can
be explained by stochastic dynamics have remained matters of debate. Herein
ENSO is viewed, unconventionally, as a two-dimensional dynamical system on a
desktop. The main features of ENSO: irregularity, interannual variability, and
the asymmetry between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na are captured, simply,
comprehensibly, quickly and cheaply, in a nonlinear stochastic limit cycle
paradigm. Its predictability for ENSO compares remarkably well with that of the
best state-of-the-art complex models from the European and American
meteorological centres. Additionally, for the first time, by analyzing
subsurface Equatorial Pacific data since 1960, this model finds that long-term
variations are not caused by ENSO itself, but by external sources.

    <title>A model study of corona emission from hydrometeors</title>
    <summary>  The maximum measured electric fields in thunderclouds are an order of
magnitude less than the fields required for electric breakdown of the air. One
explanation for lightning initiation in these low fields is that electric
breakdown first occurs at the surfaces of raindrops where the ambient field is
enhanced very locally due to the drop geometry. Laboratory experiments [Crabb &amp;
Latham, 1974] indicate that colliding raindrops which coalesce to form
elongated water filaments can produce positive corona in ambient fields close
to those measured in thunderclouds.
  We calculate the E-field distribution around a simulated coalesced drop pair
and use a numerical model to study the positive corona mechanisms in detail.
Our results give good agreement with the laboratory observations. At the
altitudes (and thus low pressures) at which lightning initiation is observed,
our results show that positive corona can occur at observed in-cloud E-fields.

    <title>Some Numerical Experiments on Round-off Error Growth in Finite Precision
  Numerical Computation</title>
    <summary>  Finite precision computations using digital computers involve the following
inherent errors: (1) Round-off error of finite precision computations (2)
Binary computer arithmetic precludes exact number representation of traditional
decimal system used in data input stage to the computer. Though the round-off
error is as small as in the seventh decimal place (single precision) in the
beginning, it can enter the mainstream computation within 50 iterations in
iterative computations, such as that used in numerical integration schemes, for
example, the commonly used fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Growth of round-off
error in recursive vis-a-vis iterative computing is described in the text. In
this paper several computational experiments are presented to demonstrate the
rapid growth of round-off error in iterative computations.

    <title>Analysis of Water Vapor spatio-temporal structure over the Madrid Area
  using GPS data</title>
    <summary>  We have analyzed Zenith Wet Delay (ZWD) time series from an experiment over
the Madrid (Spain) area obtained from 5 GPS receivers using two different
techniques. In the first case a delay correlation analysis of the ZWD
time-series has been carried out. We show that for this small network (with a
spatial scale of less than 100 km) the correlation between the time series is
very strong, and that using windowing techniques a reliable correlation delay
time series can be produced for each pair of sites (10 such pairs are
available). We use this delay time series together with a frozen flow model to
estimate the velocity of a passing front, and compare the results to
meteorological data and Numerical Weather Prediction output, showing good
agreement. In the second approach, the data is analyzed using Empirical
Orthogonal Functions. We demonstrate that the temporally demeaned and
normalized analysis yields information about the passing of fronts, while the
spatially demeaned data yields orographic information. A common second mode
highlights the underlying wave behavior.

    <title>A New Mechanism for the Maintenance of Fair Weather Electric Field and
  Cloud Electrification</title>
    <summary>  Wilson's hypothesis of the global electric circuit with the thunderstorms as
generators has not been proven up to now. The exact physical mechanism
responsible for the generation of fair weather electric field is not clearly
understood. Some of the recent remarkable observations showed evidence for the
horizontal fields in the magnetosphere and ionosphere which penetrate atleast
into the stratosphere and perhaps into the troposphere. In the present paper a
gravity wave feed back mechanism (cell dynamical system model) for the coupling
of the troposphere and the ionosphere has been discussed. The physical
mechanism proposed can offer an alternate explanation for the atmospheric
electrical phenomena during fair and disturbed weather.

    <title>Modelling horizontal and vertical concentration profiles of ozone and
  oxides of nitrogen within high-latitude urban area</title>
    <summary>  A Lagrangian column model has been developed to simulate the mean (monthly
and annual) three-dimensional structure in ozone and nitrogen oxides
concentrations in the boundary layer within and immediately around an urban
area. Short time-scale photochemical processes of ozone, as well as emissions
and deposition to the ground are simulated. The results show that the average
surface ozone concentration in the urban area is lower than the surrounding
rural areas by typically 50%. Model results are compared with observations.

    <title>The Day-night Variation of Cosmic Rays Instensity at Sea Level Under the
  Influence of Meteorological Fronts and Troughs</title>
    <summary>  The day-night variation of cosmic rays intensity at sea level has been
observed by a simple G-M counter telescope. We preform two 5 hours counting
during the day and night and find that the pattern of variation is closely
related to the atmospheric disturbance, especially when the observation station
is being affected by meterological front or trough. Such effects may lasts for
a few days until the trough or fronts weakened. The pattern of variation may be
negatively correlated to the altitude of the 0 degC level of the atmosphere.
This is closely related to the muon decay effect in the atmosphere. The
phenomenon should be further investigation for possible application in weather
forecasting.

    <title>Flatness of the setting Sun</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric refraction is responsible for the bending of light-rays in the
atmosphere. It is a result of the continuous decrease in the refractive index
of the air as a function of altitude. A well-known consequence of this
phenomenon is the apparently elliptic shape of the setting or rising Sun (or
full-Moon). In the present paper we systematically investigate this phenomenon
in a standard atmosphere. Theoretical and numerical calculations are compared
with experimental data. The asymmetric rim of the Sun is computed as a function
of its inclination angle, observational height and meteorological conditions
characterized by pressure, temperature and lapse-rate. We reveal and illustrate
some extreme and highly unusual situations.

    <summary>  Since 1988, the United Nations, through the Programme on Space Applications,
is supporting the establishment and operation of regional Centres for Space
Science and Technology Education in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America
and the Caribbean, and Western Asia. Simultaneously, education curricula have
been developed for remote sensing and geographic information system, satellite
communications, satellite meteorology and global climate, and space and
atmospheric science. The paper reviews briefly these developments and
highlights the most recent updated education curricula in the four disciplines
that are made available in 2002, in the six official languages of the United
Nations, for implementation at the regional Centres and beyond.

    <title>David Hilbert and the origin of the "Schwarzschild solution"</title>
    <summary>  The very early dismissal of Schwarzschild's original solution and manifold,
and the rise, under Schwarzschild's name, of the inequivalent solution and
manifold found instead by Hilbert, are scrutinised and commented upon, in the
light of the subsequent occurrences.
  It is reminded that Hilbert's manifold suffers from two defects, that are
absent in Schwarzschild's manifold. It does not admit a consistent drawing of
the arrow of time, and it allows for an invariant, local, intrinsic singularity
in its interior. The former defect is remedied by the change of topology of the
extensions proposed by Synge, Kruskal and Szekeres. The latter persists
unaffected in the extensions, since it is of local character.

    <title>The Inverse Variational Problem and Logistic Self-Regulated Systems</title>
    <summary>  There exists in nature many examples of systems presenting self-limiting
behaviour: population dynamics, structure engineering, Townsend's electron
breakdown, nuclear decay in radioactive equilibrium, histeresis process,
meteorological models, etcetera. In this work we call attention to the
advantages the use of a variational formulation should provide to the study of
self-regulated systems, such as a unified description of the related phenomena,
further comprehension of the internal structure and symmetries of the related
equations, and the determination of the equilibria points via the energy
function. We study the case of logistic systems, obtaining explicitly several
s-equivalent Lagrangeans corresponding to the Verhulst's equation. Some
dynamical properties are discussed in the light of this approach. Expressions
for the mean energy function are also obtained. Keywords: logistic equation,
Verhulst's Lagrangean, self-regulated systems. PACS: 02.30.Zz, 45.20.Jj,

    <title>Detrended fluctuation analysis of daily temperature records: Geographic
  dependence over Australia</title>
    <summary>  Daily temperature anomaly records are analyzed (61 for Australia, 18 for
Hungary) by means of detrended fluctuation analysis. Positive long range
asymptotic correlations extending up to 5-10 years are detected for each case.
Contrary to earlier claims, the correlation exponent is not universal for
continental stations. Interestingly, the dominant factor is geographic latitude
over Australia: the general tendency is a decrease of correlation exponent with
increasing distance from the equator. This tendency is in a complete agreement
with the results found by Tsonis et al. (1999) for 500-hPa height anomalies in
the northern hemisphere. The variance of fluctuations exhibits an opposite
trend, the larger is the distance from the equator, the larger the amplitude of
intrinsic fluctuations. The presence of Tropospheric Biennial Oscillation is
clearly identified for three stations at the north-eastern edge of the
Australian continent.

    <title>GPS radio occultation with GRACE: Atmospheric profiling utilizing the
  zero difference technique</title>
    <summary>  Radio occultation events recorded on 28-29 July 2004 by a GPS receiver aboard
the GRACE-B satellite are analyzed. The stability of the receiver clock allows
for the derivation of excess phase profiles using a zero difference technique,
rendering the calibration procedure with concurrent observations of a reference
GPS satellite obsolete. 101 refractivity profiles obtained by zero differencing
and 96 profiles calculated with an improved single difference method are
compared with co-located ECMWF meteorological analyses. Good agreement is found
at altitudes between 5 and 30 km with an average fractional refractivity
deviation below 1% and a standard deviation of 2-3%. Results from end-to-end
simulations are consistent with these observations.

    <title>Nineteenth century air pollution variations in Paris inferred from
  Eiffel Tower potential gradient measurements</title>
    <summary>  Early surface measurements of atmospheric Potential Gradient were made in
many European cities in the nineteenth century (C19th). The data was usually
obtained at hourly resolution, and good accounts of the calibration of the
instruments are also often available. The PG measurements made by Chauveau on
the Eiffel Tower, soon after its completion in the 1890s, are particularly
notable. Atmospheric electrical proxy techniques in combination with simple
boundary layer meteorology are used to determine air pollution levels. The
C19th PG measurements in both polluted and clean Parisian air present a unique
resource for European air pollution and atmospheric composition studies.

    <title>A Qualitative Description of Boundary Layer Wind Speed Records</title>
    <summary>  The complexity of the atmosphere endows it with the property of turbulence by
virtue of which, wind speed variations in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
exhibit highly irregular fluctuations that persist over a wide range of
temporal and spatial scales. Despite the large and significant body of work on
microscale turbulence, understanding the statistics of atmospheric wind speed
variations has proved to be elusive and challenging. Knowledge about the nature
of wind speed at ABL has far reaching impact on several fields of research such
as meteorology, hydrology, agriculture, pollutant dispersion, and more
importantly wind energy generation. In the present study, temporal wind speed
records from twenty eight stations distributed through out the state of North
Dakota (ND, USA), ($\sim$ 70,000 square-miles) and spanning a period of nearly
eight years are analyzed. We show that these records exhibit a characteristic
broad multifractal spectrum irrespective of the geographical location and
topography. The rapid progression of air masses with distinct qualitative
characteristics originating from Polar regions, Gulf of Mexico and Northern
Pacific account for irregular changes in the local weather system in ND. We
hypothesize that one of the primary reasons for the observed multifractal
structure could be the irregular recurrence and confluence of these three air
masses.

    <title>Energy- and flux-budget (EFB) turbulence closure model for the stably
  stratified flows. Part I: Steady-state, homogeneous regimes</title>
    <summary>  We propose a new turbulence closure model based on the budget equations for
the key second moments: turbulent kinetic and potential energies: TKE and TPE
(comprising the turbulent total energy: TTE = TKE + TPE) and vertical turbulent
fluxes of momentum and buoyancy (proportional to potential temperature).
Besides the concept of TTE, we take into account the non-gradient correction to
the traditional buoyancy flux formulation. The proposed model grants the
existence of turbulence at any gradient Richardson number, Ri. Instead of its
critical value separating - as usually assumed - the turbulent and the laminar
regimes, it reveals a transition interval, 0.1&lt; Ri &lt;1, which separates two
regimes of essentially different nature but both turbulent: strong turbulence
at Ri&lt;&lt;1; and weak turbulence, capable of transporting momentum but much less
efficient in transporting heat, at Ri&gt;1. Predictions from this model are
consistent with available data from atmospheric and lab experiments, direct
numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES).

    <title>The Development of the College Park Tornado of 24 September 2001</title>
    <summary>  The 24 September 2001 College Park, Maryland, tornado was remarkable because
of its long-track that passed within a close range of two Doppler radars. This
tornado featured many similarities to previous significant tornado events that
resulted in widespread damage in urban areas, such as the Oklahoma City tornado
of 3 May 1999. The College Park tornado was the third in a series of three
tornadoes associated with a supercell storm that developed over central
Virginia. This paper presents a synoptic and mesoscale overview of favorable
conditions and forcing mechanisms that resulted in the severe convective
outbreak associated with the College Park tornado. Convective morphology will
be examined in terms of Doppler radar and satellite imagery. This study
concludes with a discussion of the effectiveness of using MM5 guidance in
conjunction with satellite and radar imagery in the operational environment of
forecasting severe convection.

    <title>Statistical Model for Meteorological Elements Based on Local Radiosonde
  Measurements in Mediterranean Region</title>
    <summary>  A comprehensive statistical model is developed for vertical profiles of the
horizontal wind and temperature throughout the troposphere based on
several-years radiosonde measurements of strong winds. The profiles measured
under quite different atmospheric conditions exhibit qualitative similarity. A
proper choice of the reference scales for the wind, temperature and altitude
levels allow us to consider the measurement data as realizations of a random
process with universal characteristics: means, the basic functions and
parameters of standard distributions for transform coefficients of the
Principal Component Analysis. The features of the atmospheric conditions are
described by statistical characteristics of the wind-temperature ensemble of
dimensional reference scales. The model can be useful for air pollution and
safety in high-risk areas such as chemical and nuclear plants.

    <title>Signatures of fractal clustering of aerosols advected under gravity</title>
    <summary>  Aerosols under chaotic advection often approach a strange attractor. They
move chaotically on this fractal set but, in the presence of gravity, they have
a net vertical motion downwards. In practical situations, observational data
may be available only at a given level, for example at the ground level. We
uncover two fractal signatures of chaotic advection of aerosols under the
action of gravity. Each one enables the computation of the fractal dimension
$D_{0}$ of the strange attractor governing the advection dynamics from data
obtained solely at a given level. We illustrate our theoretical findings with a
numerical experiment and discuss their possible relevance to meteorology.

    <title>Fog and Dew Collection Projects in Croatia</title>
    <summary>  The present paper discusses the fog and dew water collection in Croatia.
Zavizan, the highest meteorological station in Croatia(1594m) is chosen for
collecting of fog water with a standard fog collector (SFC). The highest daily
collection rate was 27.8 L / m2. The highest daily collection rate in days
without rain was 19.1 l/m2. Dew is also a noticeable source of water,
especially during the drier summer season. Dew condensers in Croatia have been
installed on the Adriatic coast (Zadar) and islands Vis and Bisevo. We report
and discuss the data collected since 2003. In the small Bisevo island, a
special roof has been designed to improve the formation and collection of dew
on a house. Data from April 2005 will be presented and discussed.

    <title>Stable marked point processes</title>
    <summary>  In many contexts such as queuing theory, spatial statistics, geostatistics
and meteorology, data are observed at irregular spatial positions. One model of
this situation involves considering the observation points as generated by a
Poisson process. Under this assumption, we study the limit behavior of the
partial sums of the marked point process $\{(t_i,X(t_i))\}$, where X(t) is a
stationary random field and the points t_i are generated from an independent
Poisson random measure $\mathbb{N}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We define the sample
mean and sample variance statistics and determine their joint asymptotic
behavior in a heavy-tailed setting, thus extending some finite variance results
of Karr [Adv. in Appl. Probab. 18 (1986) 406--422]. New results on subsampling
in the context of a marked point process are also presented, with the
application of forming a confidence interval for the unknown mean under an
unknown degree of heavy tails.

    <title>Modeling Wildland Fire Propagation with Level Set Methods</title>
    <summary>  Level set methods are versatile and extensible techniques for general front
tracking problems, including the practically important problem of predicting
the advance of a firefront across expanses of surface vegetation. Given a rule,
empirical or otherwise, to specify the rate of advance of an infinitesimal
segment of firefront arc normal to itself (i.e., given the firespread rate as a
function of known local parameters relating to topography, vegetation, and
meteorology), level set methods harness the well developed mathematical
machinery of hyperbolic conservation laws on Eulerian grids to evolve the
position of the front in time. Topological challenges associated with the
swallowing of islands and the merger of fronts are tractable.
  The principal goals of this paper are to: collect key results from the two
largely distinct scientific literatures of level sets and firespread;
demonstrate the practical value of level set methods to wildland fire modeling
through numerical experiments; probe and address current limitations; and
propose future directions in the simulation of, and the development of
decision-aiding tools to assess countermeasure options for, wildland fires. In
addition, we introduce a freely available two-dimensional level set code used
to produce the numerical results of this paper and designed to be extensible to
more complicated configurations.

    <title>Phase Transitions of the First Kind as Radiation Processes</title>
    <summary>  Crystallization and vapor condensation are considered as processes of
sequential entering of single atoms/molecules into condensate. The latent heat
can be carry away by radiation of characteristic frequencies generated in the
course of transition. The estimated dependences of latent (radiated) energy of
boiling on temperature confirm and prove the well-known empirical Trouton's
rule applicable to many simple substances. It leads to the estimation of
interrelation of critical parameters of corresponding substances. Experimental
results of the authors and other researchers concerning crystallization from
the melt of different substances (alkali halides, sapphire, tellurium, ice,
copper) are presented, as well as condensation of water vapor, the
correspondence to the offered model is established. It allows developing of the
spectroscopy of phase transitions, and can lead to control of crystallization
process, to crystallization stimulated by the characteristic radiation, etc.
Formation of clouds in our atmosphere should be accompanied by characteristic
radiation detectable for meteorological warnings.

    <title>Comment to "Recent Climate Observations Compared to Projections" by
  Rahmstorf et al</title>
    <summary>  It is shown in this comment that considering the Mauna Loa observation of the
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and the mean near surface temperature
anomalies for the period from the beginning of the seventies to recent years
only is, clearly, a source of misinterpretation. If we consider the whole
period of available data (1958 - 2004), we obtain results which differ from
those presented by Rahmstorf et al. It is also shown that in 1988 when the
Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations and the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was established there was certainly no
correlation between the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and the mean
near surface temperature anomalies, neither on the annual time scale nor on the
monthly time scale.

    <title>Monitoring field soil suction using a miniature tensiometer</title>
    <summary>  An experimental device was developed to monitor the field soil suction using
miniature tensiometer. This device consists of a double tube system that
ensures a good contact between the tensiometer and the soil surface at the
bottom of the testing borehole. This system also ensures the tensiometer
periodical retrieving without disturbing the surrounding soil. This device was
used to monitor the soil suction at the site of Boissy-le-Ch\^atel, France. The
measurement was performed at two depths (25 and 45 cm) during two months (May
and June 2004). The recorded suction data are analyzed by comparing with the
volumetric water content data recorded using TDR (Time Domain Reflectometer)
probes as well as the meteorological data. A good agreement between these
results was observed, showing a satisfactory performance of the developed
device.

    <title>Storms prediction : Logistic regression vs random forest for unbalanced
  data</title>
    <summary>  The aim of this study is to compare two supervised classification methods on
a crucial meteorological problem. The data consist of satellite measurements of
cloud systems which are to be classified either in convective or non convective
systems. Convective cloud systems correspond to lightning and detecting such
systems is of main importance for thunderstorm monitoring and warning. Because
the problem is highly unbalanced, we consider specific performance criteria and
different strategies. This case study can be used in an advanced course of data
mining in order to illustrate the use of logistic regression and random forest
on a real data set with unbalanced classes.

    <title>The Weibull - Log Weibull Distribution for Interoccurrence Times of
  Earthquakes</title>
    <summary>  By analyzing the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic catalog for
different tectonic settings, we have found that the probability distributions
of time intervals between successive earthquakes --interoccurrence times-- can
be described by the superposition of the Weibull distribution and the
log-Weibull distribution. In particular, the distribution of large earthquakes
obeys the Weibull distribution with the exponent $\alpha_1 &lt;1$, indicating the
fact that the sequence of large earthquakes is not a Poisson process. It is
found that the ratio of the Weibull distribution to the probability
distribution of the interoccurrence time gradually increases with increase in
the threshold of magnitude. Our results infer that Weibull statistics and
log-Weibull statistics coexist in the interoccurrence time statistics, and that
the change of the distribution is considered as the change of the dominant
distribution. In this case, the dominant distribution changes from the
log-Weibull distribution to the Weibull distribution, allowing us to reinforce
the view that the interoccurrence time exhibits the transition from the Weibull
regime to the log-Weibull regime.

    <title>Quantum bit error rate in modeled atmospheres</title>
    <summary>  The quantum bit error rate is a key quantity in quantum communications. If
the quantum channel is the atmosphere, the information is usually encoded in
the polarization of a photon. A link budget is required, which takes into
account the depolarization of the photon after its interaction with the
atmosphere as well as absorption, scattering and atmospheric emissions. An
experimental setup for the reproduction of a simple model of the atmosphere is
used to evaluate the quantum bit error rate in a BB84 protocol and the results
are presented. This result represents a first step toward the realization of an
optical bench experiment where atmospheric effects are simulated and controlled
for reproducing the effects on a quantum channel in different meteorological
situations.

    <title>The Weibull - log Weibull transition of interoccurrence times for
  synthetic and natural earthquakes</title>
    <summary>  We have studied interoccurrence time distributions by analyzing the synthetic
and three natural catalogs of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the
Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC), and Taiwan Central Weather
Bureau (TCWB) and revealed the universal feature of the interoccurrence time
statistics, Weibull - log Weibull transition. This transition reinforces the
view that the interoccurrence time statistics possess Weibull statistics and
log-Weibull statistics. Here in this paper, the crossover magnitude from the
superposition regime to the Weibull regime $m_c^2$ is proportional to the plate
velocity. In addition, we have found the region-independent relation,
$m_c^2/m_{max} = 0.54 \pm 0.004$.

    <title>Some proves of integrated influence of geomagnetic activity and weather
  changes on human health</title>
    <summary>  Our environment includes many factors, and each person on the Earth is
permanently influenced by two of them: weather and magnetic field. It was found
in the works of many investigators that the weather changes correlate with
human health state. In the same time, disturbances of geomagnetic field (as one
of the space weather manifestations) may influence bioobjects, including
people. In this work we demonstrate the cumulative effect of different external
factors (space weather and meteorological weather parameters) on human health
on the base of medical experimental data (blood pressure and heart rate data
rows for 86 people). It is shown that inclusion both solar-geomagnetic and
weather parameters in simulation process give adjusting mixed parameter, which
correlates with health state significantly better, than separated environmental
parameters do.

    <title>A modified characteristic finite element method for a fully nonlinear
  formulation of the semigeostrophic flow equations</title>
    <summary>  This paper develops a fully discrete modified characteristic finite element
method for a coupled system consisting of the fully nonlinear Monge-Amp\'ere
equation and a transport equation. The system is the Eulerian formulation in
the dual space for the B. J. Hoskins' semigeostrophic flow equations, which are
widely used in meteorology to model slowly varying flows constrained by
rotation and stratification. To overcome the difficulty caused by the strong
nonlinearity, we first formulate (at the differential level) a vanishing moment
approximation of the semigeostrophic flow equations, a methodology recently
proposed by the authors \cite{Feng1,Feng2}, which involves approximating the
fully nonlinear Monge-Amp\'ere equation by a family of fourth order quasilinear
equations. We then construct a fully discrete modified characteristic finite
element method for the regularized problem. It is shown that under certain mesh
and time stepping constraints, the proposed numerical method converges with an
optimal order rate of convergence. In particular, the obtained error bounds
show explicit dependence on the regularization parameter $\vepsi$. Numerical
tests are also presented to validate the theoretical results and to gauge the
efficiency of the proposed fully discrete modified characteristic finite
element method.

    <title>Wind speed classification using Dirichlet mixtures</title>
    <summary>  Wind energy production is very sensitive to instantaneous wind speed
fluctuations. Thus rapid variation of wind speed due to changes in the local
meteorological conditions can lead to electrical power variations of the order
of the nominal power output. In small grids, as they exist for example on some
islands in the French West Indies, such fluctuations can cause instabilities in
case of intermediate power shortages. To palliate these difficulties, it is
essential to identify and characterize the wind speed distributions. This
allows to anticipate the eventuality of power shortage or power surge.
Therefore, it is of interest to categorize wind speed fluctuations into
distinct classes and to estimate the probability of a distribution to belong to
a class. This paper presents a method for classifying wind speed histograms by
estimating a finite mixture of Dirichlet distributions. The SAEM algorithm that
we use provides a fine distinction between wind speed distribution classes.
It's a new nonparametric method for wind speed sequences classification.
However, we show that the wind speed distributions in each class correspond to
specific Gram- Charlier densities.

    <title>Special section on statistics in the atmospheric sciences</title>
    <summary>  With the possible exception of gambling, meteorology, particularly
precipitation forecasting, may be the area with which the general public is
most familiar with probabilistic assessments of uncertainty. Despite the heavy
use of stochastic models and statistical methods in weather forecasting and
other areas of the atmospheric sciences, papers in these areas have
traditionally been somewhat uncommon in statistics journals. We see signs of
this changing in recent years and we have sought to highlight some present
research directions at the interface of statistics and the atmospheric sciences
in this special section.

    <title>Characterization of intermittency in renewal processes: Application to
  earthquakes</title>
    <summary>  We construct a one-dimensional piecewise linear intermittent map from the
interevent time distribution for a given renewal process. Then, we characterize
intermittency by the asymptotic behavior near the indifferent fixed point in
the piecewise linear intermittent map. Thus, we provide a new framework to
understand a unified characterization of intermittency, and also present the
Lyapunov exponent of renewal processes. This method is applied to the
occurrence of earthquakes using the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) catalog.
We demonstrate that interevent times are not independent and identically
distributed random variables by analyzing the return map of interevent times,
but that there is a systematic change in conditional probability distribution
functions of interevent times.

    <title>Large-eddy simulations of geophysical turbulent flows with applications
  to planetary boundary layer research</title>
    <summary>  The present study gives an overview and emphasizes principal moments of the
applications of the turbulence-resolving modeling with large-eddy simulation
(LES) numerical technique to planetary boundary layer (PBL) research and
climate studies. LES proved to be very useful in understanding of the
atmospheric and ocean turbulent exchange and ultimately in parameterization
improvement in traditional meteorological models. LES have played a key role in
recognizing the importance of previously ignored self-organized structures in
the geophysical turbulence. LES assisted theoreticians and weather/climate
modelers with reliable information about the averaged vertical structure of the
PBL in convection and shear regimes as well as with better estimations of key
PBL parameters, e.g. an entrainment rate, for model calibrations. At present,
LES are an essential, indispensible part of geosciences, while the mainstream
of the LES research still deals with idealized case studies with rather simple
micro-physics.

    <title>An inverse Gaussian plume approach for estimating atmospheric pollutant
  emissions from multiple point sources</title>
    <summary>  A method is developed for estimating the emission rates of contaminants into
the atmosphere from multiple point sources using measurements of particulate
material deposited at ground level. The approach is based on a Gaussian plume
type solution for the advection-diffusion equation with ground-level deposition
and given emission sources. This solution to the forward problem is
incorporated into an inverse algorithm for estimating the emission rates by
means of a linear least squares approach. The results are validated using
measured deposition and meteorological data from a large lead-zinc smelting
operation in Trail, British Columbia. The algorithm is demonstrated to be
robust and capable of generating reasonably accurate estimates of total
contaminant emissions over the relatively short distances of interest in this
study.

    <title>Regularized adaptive long autoregressive spectral analysis</title>
    <summary>  This paper is devoted to adaptive long autoregressive spectral analysis when
(i) very few data are available, (ii) information does exist beforehand
concerning the spectral smoothness and time continuity of the analyzed signals.
The contribution is founded on two papers by Kitagawa and Gersch. The first one
deals with spectral smoothness, in the regularization framework, while the
second one is devoted to time continuity, in the Kalman formalism. The present
paper proposes an original synthesis of the two contributions: a new
regularized criterion is introduced that takes both information into account.
The criterion is efficiently optimized by a Kalman smoother. One of the major
features of the method is that it is entirely unsupervised: the problem of
automatically adjusting the hyperparameters that balance data-based versus
prior-based information is solved by maximum likelihood. The improvement is
quantified in the field of meteorological radar.

    <title>Decomposing data sets into skewness modes</title>
    <summary>  We derive the nonlinear equations satisfied by the coefficients of linear
combinations that maximize their skewness when their variance is constrained to
take a specific value. In order to numerically solve these nonlinear equations
we develop a gradient-type flow that preserves the constraint. In combination
with the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition this leads to a set of orthogonal modes
with maximal skewness. For illustration purposes we apply these techniques to
atmospheric data; in this case the maximal-skewness modes correspond to
strongly localized atmospheric flows. We show how these ideas can be extended,
for example to maximal-flatness modes.

    <title>Status of the EAS studies of cosmic rays with energy below 10**16 eV</title>
    <summary>  This paper briefly summarizes the status of the cosmic ray observations by
EAS (Extended Air Shower) experiments with energy below 10**16eV and the
related studies of the hadronic interaction models. Based on the observed sharp
knee structure and the irregularities of the cosmic ray spectrum around knee
energy, plus the newly discovered electron and positron excess, the origin of
the galactic cosmic rays and the single source model interpretation are
discussed, but convincing evidence is not yet available. High precision
measurements of the mass composition of primary cosmic rays at knee energy will
be very useful to disentangle the problem. To reach this goal, a better
understanding of the hadronic interaction models is crucial. It is good to see
that more dedicated accelerator and cosmic ray experiments will be conducted
soon. As one EAS component, the muon distribution and muon charge ratio are
important for testing the hadronic interaction models. In addition muons are an
important background to neutrino experiments and all underground ultra-low
background experiments. They are also a very useful tool for the meteorological
studies.

    <title>State and parameter estimation using Monte Carlo evaluation of path
  integrals</title>
    <summary>  Transferring information from observations of a dynamical system to estimate
the fixed parameters and unobserved states of a system model can be formulated
as the evaluation of a discrete time path integral in model state space. The
observations serve as a guiding potential working with the dynamical rules of
the model to direct system orbits in state space. The path integral
representation permits direct numerical evaluation of the conditional mean path
through the state space as well as conditional moments about this mean. Using a
Monte Carlo method for selecting paths through state space we show how these
moments can be evaluated and demonstrate in an interesting model system the
explicit influence of the role of transfer of information from the
observations. We address the question of how many observations are required to
estimate the unobserved state variables, and we examine the assumptions of
Gaussianity of the underlying conditional probability.

    <title>An evidence for solar activity influence on the meteorological processes
  in the south polar region of Mars during the great opposition in AD 1924</title>
    <summary>  A time series of the Martian south ice polar cap mean diameter for the period
July-December 1924 is investigated. The data are based on the high quality
pictures, which are obtained by visual observations of 60 cm telescope in
Hamburg Observatory during the great opposition of Mars in AD 1924. After
removing of the seasonal trend (caused by the springtime regression of the cap)
quasi 36 and 80-82 days cycles in residuals has been obtained. The sunspot
activity spectra for the corresponding period is almost the same one. The local
maximums of polar cap area residuals has been occured of about 10 days after
the corresponding minimums of sunspot activity. The so obtained results are
briefly discussed.

    <title>Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transforms: a Tool for Empirical Mode
  Decomposition</title>
    <summary>  The EMD algorithm, first proposed in [11], made more robust as well as more
versatile in [12], is a technique that aims to decompose into their building
blocks functions that are the superposition of a (reasonably) small number of
components, well separated in the time-frequency plane, each of which can be
viewed as approximately harmonic locally, with slowly varying amplitudes and
frequencies. The EMD has already shown its usefulness in a wide range of
applications including meteorology, structural stability analysis, medical
studies -- see, e.g. [13]. On the other hand, the EMD algorithm contains
heuristic and ad-hoc elements that make it hard to analyze mathematically. In
this paper we describe a method that captures the flavor and philosophy of the
EMD approach, albeit using a different approach in constructing the components.
We introduce a precise mathematical definition for a class of functions that
can be viewed as a superposition of a reasonably small number of approximately
harmonic components, and we prove that our method does indeed succeed in
decomposing arbitrary functions in this class. We provide several examples, for
simulated as well as real data.

    <title>Optical turbulence forecast: toward a new era of ground-based astronomy</title>
    <summary>  The simulation of the optical turbulence (OT) for astronomical applications
obtained with non-hydrostatic atmospherical models at meso-scale presents, with
respect to measurements, some advantages. The future of the ground-based
astronomy relies upon the potentialities and feasibility of the ELTs. Our
ability in knowing, controlling and 'managing' the effects of the turbulence on
such a new generation telescopes and facilities are determinant to assure their
competitiveness with respect to the space astronomy. In the past several
studies have been carried out proving the feasibility of the simulation of
realistic Cn2 profiles above astronomical sites. The European Community (FP6
Program) decided recently to fund a Project aiming, from one side, to prove the
feasibility of the OT forecasts and the ability of meso-scale models in
discriminating astronomical sites from optical turbulence point of view and,
from the other side, to boost the development of this discipline at the
borderline between the astrophysics and the meteorology. In this contribution I
will present the scientific and technological goals of this project, the
challenges for the ground-based astronomy that are related to the success of
such a project and the international synergies that have been joint to optimize
the results.

    <title>A different glance to the site testing above Dome C</title>
    <summary>  Due to the recent interest shown by astronomers towards the Antarctic Plateau
as a potential site for large astronomical facilities, we assisted in the last
years to a strengthening of site testing activities in this region,
particularly at Dome C. Most of the results collected so far concern
meteorologic parameters and optical turbulence measurements based on different
principles using different instruments. At present we have several elements
indicating that, above the first 20-30 meters, the quality of the optical
turbulence above Dome C is better than above whatever other site in the world.
The challenging question, crucial to know which kind of facilities to build on,
is to establish how much better the Dome C is than a mid-latitude site. In this
contribution we will provide some complementary elements and strategies of
analysis aiming to answer to this question. We will try to concentrate the
attention on critical points, i.e. open questions that still require
explanation/attention.

    <title>Generalized Mittag-Leffler Distributions and Processes for Applications
  in Astrophysics and Time Series Modeling</title>
    <summary>  Geometric generalized Mittag-Leffler distributions having the Laplace
transform $\frac{1}{1+\beta\log(1+t^\alpha)},0&lt;\alpha\le 2,\beta&gt;0$ is
introduced and its properties are discussed. Autoregressive processes with
Mittag-Leffler and geometric generalized Mittag-Leffler marginal distributions
are developed. Haubold and Mathai (2000) derived a closed form representation
of the fractional kinetic equation and thermonuclear function in terms of
Mittag-Leffler function. Saxena et al (2002, 2004a,b) extended the result and
derived the solutions of a number of fractional kinetic equations in terms of
generalized Mittag-Leffler functions. These results are useful in explaining
various fundamental laws of physics. Here we develop first-order autoregressive
time series models and the properties are explored. The results have
applications in various areas like astrophysics, space sciences, meteorology,
financial modeling and reliability modeling.

    <title>Conditional Sampling for Spectrally Discrete Max-Stable Random Fields</title>
    <summary>  Max-stable random fields play a central role in modeling extreme value
phenomena. We obtain an explicit formula for the conditional probability in
general max-linear models, which include a large class of max-stable random
fields. As a consequence, we develop an algorithm for efficient and exact
sampling from the conditional distributions. Our method provides a
computational solution to the prediction problem for spectrally discrete
max-stable random fields. This work offers new tools and a new perspective to
many statistical inference problems for spatial extremes, arising, for example,
in meteorology, geology, and environmental applications.

    <title>Lie symmetry analysis and exact solutions of the quasi-geostrophic
  two-layer problem</title>
    <summary>  The quasi-geostrophic two-layer model is of superior interest in dynamic
meteorology since it is one of the easiest ways to study baroclinic processes
in geophysical fluid dynamics. The complete set of point symmetries of the
two-layer equations is determined. An optimal set of one- and two-dimensional
inequivalent subalgebras of the maximal Lie invariance algebra is constructed.
On the basis of these subalgebras we exhaustively carry out group-invariant
reduction and compute various classes of exact solutions. Where possible,
reference to the physical meaning of the exact solutions is given. In
particular, the well-known baroclinic Rossby wave solutions in the two-layer
model are rediscovered.

    <title>Accuracy of the Water Vapour Content Measurements in the Atmosphere
  Using Optical Methods</title>
    <summary>  This paper describes the accuracy and the errors of water vapour content
measurements in the atmosphere using optical methods, especially
starphotometer. After the general explanations of the used expressions for the
star-magnitude observations of the water vapour absorption in section 3 the
absorption model for the water vapour band will be discussed. Sections 4 and 5
give an overview on the technique to determine the model parameters both from
spectroscopic laboratory and radiosonde observation data. Finally, the sections
6 and 7 are dealing with the details of the errors; that means errors of
observable magnitude, of instrumental extraterrestrial magnitude, of
atmospheric extinction determination and of water vapour content determination
by radiosonde humidity measurements. The main conclusion is: Because of the
high precision of the results the optical methods for water vapour observation
are suited to validate and calibrate alternative methods (GPS, LIDAR,
MICROWAVE) which are making constant progress world-wide in these days.

    <title>Analysis of the planetary boundary layer with a database of large-eddy
  simulation experiments</title>
    <summary>  Observational studies of a planetary boundary layer (PBL) are difficult.
Ground-born measurements usually characterize only a small portion of the PBL
immediately above the surface. Air-born measurements cannot be obtained close
to the surface and therefore cannot capture any significant portion of the PBL
interior. Moreover, observations are limited in choice of instrumentation,
time, duration, location of measurements and occasional weather conditions.
Although turbulence-resolving simulations with a large-eddy simulation (LES)
code do not supplant observational studies, they provide valuable complementary
information on different aspect of the PBL dynamics, which otherwise difficult
to acquire. These circumstances motivated development of a medium-resolution
database (DATABASE64) of turbulence-resolving simulations, which is available
on ftp://ftp.nersc.no/igor/. DATABASE64 covers a range of physical parameters
typical for the barotropic SBL over a homogeneous rough surface. LES runs in
DATABASE64 simulate 16 hours' evolution of the PBL turbulence. They are
utilized to study both transition and equilibrium SBL cases as well as to
calibrate turbulence parameterizations of meteorological models. The data can
be also used to falsify theoretical constructions with regards to the PBL.

    <title>Multiple change-point Poisson model for threshold exceedances of air
  pollution concentrations</title>
    <summary>  A Bayesian multiple change-point model is proposed to analyse violations of
air quality standards by pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO2 and NO) and
carbon monoxide (CO). The model is built on the assumption that the occurrence
of threshold exceedances may be described by a non-homogeneous Poisson process
with a step rate function. Unlike earlier approaches, our model is not
restricted by a predetermined number of change-points, nor does it involve any
covariates. Possible short-range correlations in the exceedance data (e.g., due
to chemical and meteorological factors) are removed via declusterisation. The
unknown rate function is estimated using a reversible jump MCMC sampling
algorithm adapted from Green (1995), which allows for transitions between
parameter subspaces of varying dimension. This technique is applied to the
17-year (1993-2009) daily NO2, NO and CO concentration data in the City of
Leeds, UK. The results are validated by running the MCMC estimator on simulated
data replicated via a posterior estimate of the rate function. The findings are
interpreted and discussed in relation to some known traffic control actions.
The proposed methodology may be useful in the air quality management context by
providing quantitative objective means to measure the efficacy of pollution
control programmes.

    <title>Statistical Modeling for Wind-Temperature Meteorological Elements in
  Troposphere</title>
    <summary>  A comprehensive statistical model for vertical profiles of the horizontal
wind and temperature throughout the troposphere is presented. The model is
based on radiosonde measurements of wind and temperature during several years.
The profiles measured under quite different atmospheric conditions exhibit
qualitative similarity, and a proper choice of the reference scales for the
wind, temperature and altitude levels allows to consider the measurement data
as realizations of a random process with universal characteristics: means, the
basic functions and parameters of standard distributions for transform
coefficients of the Principal Component Analysis. The features of the
atmospheric conditions are described by statistical characteristics of the
wind-temperature ensemble of dimensional reference scales. The high
effectiveness of the proposed approach is provided by a similarity of wind -
temperature vertical profiles, which allow to carry out the statistical
modeling in the low-dimension space of the dimensional reference scales for the
wind, temperature and altitude levels. The knowledge of the joint
wind-temperature distributions in altitude open wide perspectives for modeling
of various physical processes in real atmospheric conditions like the transfer
of passive scalars or impurities, the electromagnetic wave penetration, the
instability of internal waves, transition to turbulence etc.

    <title>Giant Magellan Telescope Site Testing Summary</title>
    <summary>  Cerro Las Campanas located at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) in Chile has
been selected as the site for the Giant Magellan Telescope. We report results
obtained since the commencement, in 2005, of a systematic site testing survey
of potential GMT sites at LCO. Meteorological (cloud cover, temperature,
pressure, wind, and humidity) and DIMM seeing data have been obtained at three
potential sites, and are compared with identical data taken at the site of the
twin Magellan 6.5m telescopes. In addition, measurements of the turbulence
profile of the free-atmosphere above LCO have been collected with a MASS/DIMM.
Furthermore, we consider photometric quality, light pollution, and precipitable
water vapor (PWV). LCO, and Co. Las Campanas in particular, have dark skies,
little or no risk of future light pollution, excellent seeing, moderate winds,
PWV adequate for mid-IR astronomy during a reasonable fraction of the nights,
and a high fraction of clear nights overall. Finally, Co. Las Campanas meets or
exceeds all the defined science requirements.

    <title>A Stochastic Energy Budget Model Using Physically Based Red Noise</title>
    <summary>  A method to describe unresolved processes in meteorological models by
physically based stochastic processes (SP) is proposed by the example of an
energy budget model (EBM). Contrary to the common approach using additive white
noise, a suitable variable within the model is chosen to be represented by a
SP. Spectral analysis of ice core time series shows a red noise character of
the underlying fluctuations. Fitting Ornstein Uhlenbeck processes to the
observed spectrum defines the parameters for the stochastic dynamic model
(SDM). Numerical simulations for different sets of ice core data lead to three
sets of strongly differing systems. Pathwise, statistical and spectral analysis
of these models show the importance of carefully choosing suitable stochastic
terms in order to get a physically meaningful SDM.

    <title>Sensitivity And Out-Of-Sample Error in Continuous Time Data Assimilation</title>
    <summary>  Data assimilation refers to the problem of finding trajectories of a
prescribed dynamical model in such a way that the output of the model (usually
some function of the model states) follows a given time series of observations.
Typically though, these two requirements cannot both be met at the same
time--tracking the observations is not possible without the trajectory
deviating from the proposed model equations, while adherence to the model
requires deviations from the observations. Thus, data assimilation faces a
trade-off. In this contribution, the sensitivity of the data assimilation with
respect to perturbations in the observations is identified as the parameter
which controls the trade-off. A relation between the sensitivity and the
out-of-sample error is established which allows to calculate the latter under
operational conditions. A minimum out-of-sample error is proposed as a
criterion to set an appropriate sensitivity and to settle the discussed
trade-off. Two approaches to data assimilation are considered, namely
variational data assimilation and Newtonian nudging, aka synchronisation.
Numerical examples demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

    <title>Improving the Load Balancing Performance of Vlasiator</title>
    <summary>  This whitepaper describes the load-balancing performance issues that are
observed and tackled during the petascaling of the Vlasiator codes. Vlasiator
is a Vlasov-hybrid simulation code developed in Finnish Meteorological
Institute (FMI). Vlasiator models the communications associated with the
spatial grid operated on as a hypergraph and partitions the grid using the
parallel hypergraph partitioning scheme (PHG) of the Zoltan partitioning
framework. The result of partitioning determines the distribution of grid cells
to processors. It is observed that the partitioning phase takes a substantial
percentage of the overall computation time. Alternative
(graph-partitioning-based) schemes that perform almost as well as the
hypergraph partitioning scheme and that require less preprocessing overhead and
better balance are proposed and investigated. A comparison in terms of effect
on running time, preprocessing overhead and load-balancing quality of Zoltan's
PHG, ParMeTiS, and PT-SCOTCH are presented. Test results on J\"uelich
BlueGene/P cluster are presented.

    <title>Coupled Atmosphere-Fire Simulations of Fireflux: Impacts of Model
  Resolution on Model Performance</title>
    <summary>  The ability to forecast grass fire spread could be of a great importance for
agencies making decisions about prescribed burns. However, the usefulness of
the models used for fire-spread predictions is limited by the time required for
completing the coupled atmosphere-fire simulations. In this study we analyze
the sensitivity of a coupled model with respect to the vertical resolution of
the atmospheric grid and the resolution of fire mesh that both affect
computational performance of the model. Based on the observations of the plume
properties recorded during the FireFlux experiment (Clements et al., 2007), we
try to establish the optimal model configuration that provides realistic
results for the least computational expense.

    <title>Early Warning with Calibrated and Sharper Probabilistic Forecasts</title>
    <summary>  Given a nonlinear model, a probabilistic forecast may be obtained by Monte
Carlo simulations. At a given forecast horizon, Monte Carlo simulations yield
sets of discrete forecasts, which can be converted to density forecasts. The
resulting density forecasts will inevitably be downgraded by model
mis-specification. In order to enhance the quality of the density forecasts,
one can mix them with the unconditional density. This paper examines the value
of combining conditional density forecasts with the unconditional density. The
findings have positive implications for issuing early warnings in different
disciplines including economics and meteorology, but UK inflation forecasts are
considered as an example.

    <title>The long sunspot cycle 23 predicts a significant temperature decrease in
  cycle 24</title>
    <summary>  Relations between the length of a sunspot cycle and the average temperature
in the same and the next cycle are calculated for a number of meteorological
stations in Norway and in the North Atlantic region. No significant trend is
found between the length of a cycle and the average temperature in the same
cycle, but a significant negative trend is found between the length of a cycle
and the temperature in the next cycle. This provides a tool to predict an
average temperature decrease of at least 1.0 "C from solar cycle 23 to 24 for
the stations and areas analyzed. We find for the Norwegian local stations
investigated that 25-56% of the temperature increase the last 150 years may be
attributed to the Sun. For 3 North Atlantic stations we get 63-72% solar
contribution. This points to the Atlantic currents as reinforcing a solar
signal.

    <title>Probabilistic wind speed forecasting in Hungary</title>
    <summary>  Prediction of various weather quantities is mostly based on deterministic
numerical weather forecasting models. Multiple runs of these models with
different initial conditions result ensembles of forecasts which are applied
for estimating the distribution of future weather quantities. However, the
ensembles are usually under-dispersive and uncalibrated, so post-processing is
required.
  In the present work Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is applied for calibrating
ensembles of wind speed forecasts produced by the operational Limited Area
Model Ensemble Prediction System of the Hungarian Meteorological Service (HMS).
  We describe two possible BMA models for wind speed data of the HMS and show
that BMA post-processing significantly improves the calibration and precision
of forecasts.

    <title>Field evidence for the upwind velocity shift at the crest of low dunes</title>
    <summary>  Wind topographically forced by hills and sand dunes accelerates on the upwind
(stoss) slopes and reduces on the downwind (lee) slopes. This secondary wind
regime, however, possesses a subtle effect, reported here for the first time
from field measurements of near-surface wind velocity over a low dune: the wind
velocity close to the surface reaches its maximum upwind of the crest. Our
field-measured data show that this upwind phase shift of velocity with respect
to topography is found to be in quantitative agreement with the prediction of
hydrodynamical linear analysis for turbulent flows with first order closures.
This effect, together with sand transport spatial relaxation, is at the origin
of the mechanisms of dune initiation, instability and growth.

    <title>Photometric Variability of the Disk Integrated Infrared Emission of the
  Earth</title>
    <summary>  We present an analysis of the global-integrated mid-infrared emission flux of
the Earth based on data derived from satellite measurements. We have studied
the photometric annual, seasonal, and rotational variability of the thermal
emission of the Earth to determine which properties can be inferred from the
point-like signal. We find that the analysis of the time series allows us to
determine the 24 hr rotational period of the planet for most observing
geometries, due to large warm and cold areas, identified with geographic
features, which appear consecutively in the observer's planetary view. However,
the effects of global-scale meteorology can effectively mask the rotation for
several days at a time. We also find that orbital time series exhibit a
seasonal modulation, whose amplitude depends strongly on the latitude of the
observer but weakly on its ecliptic longitude. As no systematic difference of
brightness temperature is found between the dayside and nightside, the phase
variations of the Earth in the infrared range are negligible. Finally, we also
conclude that the phase variation of a spatially unresolved Earth-Moon system
is dominated by the lunar signal.

    <title>Visualizing 2D Flows with Animated Arrow Plots</title>
    <summary>  Flow fields are often represented by a set of static arrows to illustrate
scientific vulgarization, documentary film, meteorology, etc. This simple
schematic representation lets an observer intuitively interpret the main
properties of a flow: its orientation and velocity magnitude. We propose to
generate dynamic versions of such representations for 2D unsteady flow fields.
Our algorithm smoothly animates arrows along the flow while controlling their
density in the domain over time. Several strategies have been combined to lower
the unavoidable popping artifacts arising when arrows appear and disappear and
to achieve visually pleasing animations. Disturbing arrow rotations in low
velocity regions are also handled by continuously morphing arrow glyphs to
semi-transparent discs. To substantiate our method, we provide results for
synthetic and real velocity field datasets.

    <title>Origin of atmospheric aerosols at the Pierre Auger Observatory using
  backward trajectory of air masses</title>
    <summary>  The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest operating cosmic ray observatory
ever built. Calorimetric measurements of extensive air showers induced by
cosmic rays are performed with a fluorescence detector. Thus, one of the main
challenges is the monitoring of the atmosphere, both in terms of atmospheric
state variables and optical properties. To better understand the atmospheric
conditions, a study of air mass trajectories above the site is presented. Such
a study has been done using an air-modelling program well known in atmospheric
sciences. Its validity has been checked using meteorological radiosonde
soundings performed at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Finally, aerosol
concentration values measured by the Central Laser Facility are compared to
backward trajectories.

    <title>Conditional Chow-Liu Tree Structures for Modeling Discrete-Valued Vector
  Time Series</title>
    <summary>  We consider the problem of modeling discrete-valued vector time series data
using extensions of Chow-Liu tree models to capture both dependencies across
time and dependencies across variables. Conditional Chow-Liu tree models are
introduced, as an extension to standard Chow-Liu trees, for modeling
conditional rather than joint densities. We describe learning algorithms for
such models and show how they can be used to learn parsimonious representations
for the output distributions in hidden Markov models. These models are applied
to the important problem of simulating and forecasting daily precipitation
occurrence for networks of rain stations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
the models, we compare their performance versus a number of alternatives using
historical precipitation data from Southwestern Australia and the Western
United States. We illustrate how the structure and parameters of the models can
be used to provide an improved meteorological interpretation of such data.

    <title>Fundamentals of Atmospheric Physics for Engineering</title>
    <summary>  We present the proposal of an elective for engineering courses, designed to
train professionals with a solid foundation in Physics of the Atmosphere
interested in environmental and sustainability issues broadly. We propose four
chapters that contain a variety of topics but strongly interrelated, which
correspond to three main areas: nature of the atmosphere and meteorology
relevant to contaminant transport, the dispersion of air pollutants and climate
in general. We conclude that it is possible train engineers who understand the
basic mechanisms that led to the current atmosphere, atmospheric processes
related to local and global climate, the dispersion of air pollutants and key
concepts such as solar activity, climatic change and climatic variability, even
in one semester. It also discusses the relationship with other subjects and
proposes and illustrates a method of course approval based on the performance
of work directly applicable to engineering problems.

    <title>Description of Atmospheric Conditions at the Pierre Auger Observatory
  Using Meteorological Measurements and Models</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric conditions at the site of a cosmic ray observatory must be known
well for reconstructing observed extensive air showers, especially when
measured using the fluorescence technique. For the Pierre Auger Observatory, a
sophisticated network of atmospheric monitoring devices has been conceived.
Part of this monitoring was a weather balloon program to measure atmospheric
state variables above the Observatory. To use the data in reconstructions of
air showers, monthly models have been constructed. Scheduled balloon launches
were abandoned and replaced with launches triggered by high-energetic air
showers as part of a rapid monitoring system. Currently, the balloon launch
program is halted and atmospheric data from numerical weather prediction models
are used. A description of the balloon measurements, the monthly models as well
as the data from the numerical weather prediction are presented.

    <title>Performance Analysis of ANFIS in short term Wind Speed Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Results are presented on the performance of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
system (ANFIS) for wind velocity forecasts in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region
in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. The data bank was provided by the
meteorological station located at the University of Isthmus, Tehuantepec
campus, and this data bank covers the period from 2008 to 2011. Three data
models were constructed to carry out 16, 24 and 48 hours forecasts using the
following variables: wind velocity, temperature, barometric pressure, and date.
The performance measure for the three models is the mean standard error (MSE).
In this work, performance analysis in short-term prediction is presented,
because it is essential in order to define an adequate wind speed model for
eolian parks, where a right planning provide economic benefits.

    <title>A Comparison between CODYRUN and TRNSYS, simulation models for thermal
  buildings behaviour</title>
    <summary>  Simulation codes of thermal behaviour could significantly improve housing
construction design. Among the existing software, CODYRUN and TRNSYS are
calculations codes of different conceptions. CODYRUN is exclusively dedicated
to housing thermal behaviour, whereas TRNSYS is more generally used on any
thermal system. The purpose of this article is to compare these two instruments
in two different conditions . We will first modelize a mono-zone test cell, and
analyse the results by means of signal treatment methods. Then, we will
modelize a real case of multi-zone housing, representative of housing in wet
tropical climates. We could so evaluate influences of meteorological and
building description data on model errors.

    <title>Multiple model software for airflow and thermal building simulation. A
  case study under tropical humid climate, in Réunion Island</title>
    <summary>  The first purpose of our work has been to allow -as far as heat transfer
modes, airflow calculation and meteorological data reconstitution are
concerned- the integration of diverse interchangeable physical models in a
single software tool for professional use, CODYRUN. The designer's objectives,
precision requested and calculation time consideration, lead us to design a
structure accepting selective use of models, taking into account multizone
description and airflow patterns. With a building case study in Reunion Island,
we first analyse the sensibility of the thermal model to diffuse radiation
reconstitution on tilted surfaces. Then, a realistic balance between precision
required and calculation time leads us to select detailed models for the zone
of main interest, but to choose simplified models for the other zones.

    <title>Weather sequences for predicting HVAC system behaviour in residential
  units located in tropical climates</title>
    <summary>  The purpose of our research deals with the description of a methodology for
the definition of specific weather sequences and their influence on the energy
needs of HVAC system. We'll apply the method on the tropical Reunion Island.
The methodological approach based on a detailed analysis of weather sequences
leads to a classification of climatic situations that can be applied to the
site. These sequences have been used to simulate buildings and air handling
systems thanks to a thermal simulation code, CODYRUN. Results bring to the
light how necessary it is to have coherent meteorological data for this kind of
simulation.

    <title>The L dwarf/T dwarf transition: multiplicity, magnetic activity and
  mineral meteorology across the hydrogen burning limit</title>
    <summary>  The transition between the L dwarf and T dwarf spectral classes is one of the
most remarkable along the stellar/brown dwarf Main Sequence, separating sources
with photospheres containing mineral condensate clouds from those containing
methane and ammonia gases. Unusual characteristics of this transition include a
1 micron brightening between late L and early T dwarfs observed in both
parallax samples and coeval binaries; a spike in the multiplicity fraction;
evidence of increased photometric variability, possibly arising from patchy
cloud structures; and a delayed transition for young, planetary-mass objects.
All of these features can be explained if this transition is governed by the
"rapid" (nonequlibrium) rainout of clouds from the photosphere, triggered by
temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and (perhaps) rotational effects.
While the underlying mechanism of this rainout remains under debate, the
transition is now being exploited to discover and precisely characterize tight
(&lt; 1 AU) very low-mass binaries that can be used to test brown dwarf
evolutionary and atmospheric theories, and resolved binaries that further
constrain the properties of this remarkable transition.

    <title>Systemic delay propagation in the US airport network</title>
    <summary>  Technologically driven transport systems are characterized by a networked
structure connecting operation centers and by a dynamics ruled by
pre-established schedules. Schedules impose serious constraints on the timing
of the operations, condition the allocation of resources and define a baseline
to assess system performance. Here we study the performance of an air
transportation system in terms of delays. Technical, operational or
meteorological issues affecting some flights give rise to primary delays. When
operations continue, such delays can propagate, magnify and eventually involve
a significant part of the network. We define metrics able to quantify the level
of network congestion and introduce a model that reproduces the delay
propagation patterns observed in the U.S. performance data. Our results
indicate that there is a non-negligible risk of systemic instability even under
normal operating conditions. We also identify passenger and crew connectivity
as the most relevant internal factor contributing to delay spreading.

    <title>Spatial analysis of wave direction data using wrapped Gaussian processes</title>
    <summary>  Directional data arise in various contexts such as oceanography (wave
directions) and meteorology (wind directions), as well as with measurements on
a periodic scale (weekdays, hours, etc.). Our contribution is to introduce a
model-based approach to handle periodic data in the case of measurements taken
at spatial locations, anticipating structured dependence between these
measurements. We formulate a wrapped Gaussian spatial process model for this
setting, induced from a customary linear Gaussian process. We build a
hierarchical model to handle this situation and show that the fitting of such a
model is possible using standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Our approach
enables spatial interpolation (and can accommodate measurement error). We
illustrate with a set of wave direction data from the Adriatic coast of Italy,
generated through a complex computer model.

    <title>Distributed simulation of city inundation by coupled surface and
  subsurface porous flow for urban flood decision support system</title>
    <summary>  We present a decision support system for flood early warning and disaster
management. It includes the models for data-driven meteorological predictions,
for simulation of atmospheric pressure, wind, long sea waves and seiches; a
module for optimization of flood barrier gates operation; models for stability
assessment of levees and embankments, for simulation of city inundation
dynamics and citizens evacuation scenarios. The novelty of this paper is a
coupled distributed simulation of surface and subsurface flows that can predict
inundation of low-lying inland zones far from the submerged waterfront areas,
as observed in St. Petersburg city during the floods. All the models are
wrapped as software services in the CLAVIRE platform for urgent computing,
which provides workflow management and resource orchestration.

    <title>Interpolation of nonstationary high frequency spatial-temporal
  temperature data</title>
    <summary>  The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program is a U.S. Department of Energy
project that collects meteorological observations at several locations around
the world in order to study how weather processes affect global climate change.
As one of its initiatives, it operates a set of fixed but irregularly-spaced
monitoring facilities in the Southern Great Plains region of the U.S. We
describe methods for interpolating temperature records from these fixed
facilities to locations at which no observations were made, which can be useful
when values are required on a spatial grid. We interpolate by conditionally
simulating from a fitted nonstationary Gaussian process model that accounts for
the time-varying statistical characteristics of the temperatures, as well as
the dependence on solar radiation. The model is fit by maximizing an
approximate likelihood, and the conditional simulations result in
well-calibrated confidence intervals for the predicted temperatures. We also
describe methods for handling spatial-temporal jumps in the data to interpolate
a slow-moving cold front.

    <title>Discovery of lake-effect clouds on Titan</title>
    <summary>  Images from instruments on Cassini as well as from telescopes on the ground
reveal the presence of sporadic small-scale cloud activity in the cold
late-winter north polar of Saturn's large moon Titan. These clouds lie
underneath the previously discovered uniform polar cloud attributed to a
quiescent ethane cloud at ~40 km and appear confined to the same latitudes as
those of the largest known hydrocarbon lakes at the north pole of Titan. The
physical properties of these clouds suggest that they are due to methane
convection and condensation. Such convection has not been predicted for the
cold winter pole, but can be caused by a process in many ways analogous to
terrestrial lake-effect clouds. The lakes on Titan are a key connection between
the surface and the meteorological cycle.

    <title>Non-Hydrostatic Effects in the Interaction between Flow and Orography</title>
    <summary>  The interaction between flows and orography is a fundamental aspect of
theoretical fluid dynamics for its direct applications (e.g., in dynamical
meteorology); a comprehensive description is nowadays still lacking in some
aspects. In this work, in particular, the authors would like to face the
problem of flow-blocking and of the streamlines pattern formation, examining
the role of stratification (i.e., Brunt-Vaisala frequency) and Froude number on
these problems. In particular this work wants to investigate the role of
vertical advection on flow-blocking and on streamlines geometry. The importance
of streamlines curvature and stratification for the formation of pressure
perturbation, then their role in flow-blocking will be shown. Moreover it will
be shown how flow-blocking cannot be easly predict using only a stratification
parameter or the Froude number.

    <title>Etude experimentale et theorique du mouvement des gouttes immiscibles
  dans un milieu continu au repos</title>
    <summary>  The problem of the movement of the drops in a continuous environment
represents a fundamental step for the study of two phases flows. Their domains
of application are enormous as: the combustion of the rooms of the machines
thermal, extraction of a liquid of another liquid, catalyst used to trigger the
chemical reactions occurring in access points, sparkling absorption by the
drops of water in meteorology. The object of our work is to translate the
movement of the immiscibles drops in water by a relation expressing the
terminal velocity of the drop according to her equivalent diameter. This
relation although theoretical has been validated by the experimental and
numeric model.

    <title>Preface "Nonlinear processes in oceanic and atmospheric flows"</title>
    <summary>  Nonlinear phenomena are essential ingredients in many oceanic and atmospheric
processes, and successful understanding of them benefits from multidisciplinary
collaboration between oceanographers, meteorologists, physicists and
mathematicians. The present Special Issue on ``Nonlinear Processes in Oceanic
and Atmospheric Flows'' contains selected contributions from attendants to the
workshop which, in the above spirit, was held in Castro Urdiales, Spain, in
July 2008. Here we summarize the Special Issue contributions, which include
papers on the characterization of ocean transport in the Lagrangian and in the
Eulerian frameworks, generation and variability of jets and waves, interactions
of fluid flow with plankton dynamics or heavy drops, scaling in meteorological
fields, and statistical properties of El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation.

    <title>Successful modeling of the environmental changes' influence on forests'
  vegetation over North Eurasia</title>
    <summary>  Modeling of forests' vegetation in North Eurasia has been performed for
1982-2006 on the basis of remote sensing data. Four meteorological parameters
and one parameter, characterizing geomagnetic field disturbance level, were
used for this aim. It was found out that revealed formula is adequate both for
coniferous evergreen and coniferous deciduous forests for accuracy to a
coefficient. The most proper parameters' combination gives the correlation
coefficients ~ 0.9 between modeling parameter and original data rows. These
results could solve problems of climate-forests feedbacks' investigations and
be useful for dendrological aims.

    <title>Graph-Valued Regression</title>
    <summary>  Undirected graphical models encode in a graph $G$ the dependency structure of
a random vector $Y$. In many applications, it is of interest to model $Y$ given
another random vector $X$ as input. We refer to the problem of estimating the
graph $G(x)$ of $Y$ conditioned on $X=x$ as ``graph-valued regression.'' In
this paper, we propose a semiparametric method for estimating $G(x)$ that
builds a tree on the $X$ space just as in CART (classification and regression
trees), but at each leaf of the tree estimates a graph. We call the method
``Graph-optimized CART,'' or Go-CART. We study the theoretical properties of
Go-CART using dyadic partitioning trees, establishing oracle inequalities on
risk minimization and tree partition consistency. We also demonstrate the
application of Go-CART to a meteorological dataset, showing how graph-valued
regression can provide a useful tool for analyzing complex data.

    <title>Fast finite difference solvers for singular solutions of the elliptic
  Monge-Ampère equation</title>
    <summary>  The elliptic Monge-Ampere equation is a fully nonlinear Partial Differential
Equation which originated in geometric surface theory, and has been applied in
dynamic meteorology, elasticity, geometric optics, image processing and image
registration. Solutions can be singular, in which case standard numerical
approaches fail. In this article we build a finite difference solver for the
Monge-Ampere equation, which converges even for singular solutions. Regularity
results are used to select a priori between a stable, provably convergent
monotone discretization and an accurate finite difference discretization in
different regions of the computational domain. This allows singular solutions
to be computed using a stable method, and regular solutions to be computed more
accurately. The resulting nonlinear equations are then solved by Newton's
method. Computational results in two and three dimensions validate the claims
of accuracy and solution speed. A computational example is presented which
demonstrates the necessity of the use of the monotone scheme near
singularities.

    <title>On the wave energy potential of Western Black Sea shelf</title>
    <summary>  In the present study we evaluate the approaches to estimate the wave energy
potential of the western Black Sea shelf with numerical models. For the purpose
of our evaluation and due to the lack of long time series of measurements in
the selected area of the Black Sea, we compare the modeled mean wave power flux
output from the SWAN wave model with the only available long term measurements
from the buoy of Gelendzhik for the period 1997-2003 (with gaps). The forcing
meteorological data for the numerical wave models for the selected years is
extracted from the ERA Interim reanalysis of ECMWF (European Centre for Medium
range Forecasts). For the year 2003 we also compare the estimated wave power
with the modeled by SWAN, using ALADIN regional atmospheric model winds. We try
to identify the shortcomings and limitations of the numerical modeling approach
to the evaluation of the wave energy potential in Black Sea.

    <title>Bayesian hierarchical modeling of extreme hourly precipitation in Norway</title>
    <summary>  Spatial maps of extreme precipitation are a critical component of flood
estimation in hydrological modeling, as well as in the planning and design of
important infrastructure. This is particularly relevant in countries such as
Norway that have a high density of hydrological power generating facilities and
are exposed to significant risk of infrastructure damage due to flooding. In
this work, we estimate a spatially coherent map of the distribution of extreme
hourly precipitation in Norway, in terms of return levels, by linking
generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions with latent Gaussian fields in a
Bayesian hierarchical model. Generalized linear models on the parameters of the
GEV distribution are able to incorporate location-specific geographic and
meteorological information and thereby accommodate these effects on extreme
precipitation. A Gaussian field on the GEV parameters captures additional
unexplained spatial heterogeneity and overcomes the sparse grid on which
observations are collected. We conduct an extensive analysis of the factors
that affect the GEV parameters and show that our combination is able to
appropriately characterize both the spatial variability of the distribution of
extreme hourly precipitation in Norway, and the associated uncertainty in these
estimates.

    <title>Comparison of BMA and EMOS statistical calibration methods for
  temperature and wind speed ensemble weather prediction</title>
    <summary>  The evolution of the weather can be described by deterministic numerical
weather forecasting models. Multiple runs of these models with different
initial conditions and/or model physics result in forecast ensembles which are
used for estimating the distribution of future atmospheric variables. However,
these ensembles are usually under-dispersive and uncalibrated, so
post-processing is required.
  In the present work we compare different versions of Bayesian Model Averaging
(BMA) and Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) post-processing methods in
order to calibrate 2m temperature and 10m wind speed forecasts of the
operational ALADIN Limited Area Model Ensemble Prediction System of the
Hungarian Meteorological Service. We show that compared to the raw ensemble
both post-processing methods improve the calibration of probabilistic and
accuracy of point forecasts and that the best BMA method slightly outperforms
the EMOS technique.

    <title>Gaussian linear state-space model for wind fields in the North-East
  Atlantic</title>
    <summary>  A space-time model for wind fields is proposed. It aims at simulating
realistic wind conditions with a focus on reproducing the space-time motions of
the meteorological systems. A Gaussian linear state-space model is used where
the latent state may be interpreted as regional wind condition and the
observation equation links regional and local scales. Parameter estimation is
performed by combining a method of moment and the EM algorithm whose
performances are discussed using simulation studies. The model is fitted to
6-hourly reanalysis data in the North-East Atlantic. It is shown that the
fitted model is interpretable and provide a good description of important
properties of the space-time covariance function of the data, such as the non
full-symmetry induced by prevailing flows in this area.

    <title>Testing Potential New Sites for Optical Telescopes in Australia</title>
    <summary>  In coming years, Australia may find the need to build new optical telescopes
to continue local programmes, contribute to global survey projects, and form a
local multi-wavelength connection for the new radio telescopes being built. In
this study, we refine possible locations for a new optical telescope by
studying remotely sensed meteorological infrared data to ascertain expected
cloud coverage rates across Australia, and combine these data with a Digital
Elevation Model using a Geographic Information System. We find that the best
sites within Australia for building optical telescopes are likely to be on the
highest mountains in the Hamersley Range in Northwest Western Australia, while
the MacDonnell Ranges in the Northern Territory may also be appropriate. We
believe that similar seeing values to Siding Spring should be obtainable and
with significantly more observing time at the identified sites. We expect to
find twice as many clear nights as at current telescope sites. These sites are
thus prime locations for future on-site testing.

    <title>Quantifying the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) coupling to CO2
  concentration and to the length of day variations</title>
    <summary>  The El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the Earth's strongest climate
fluctuation on inter-annual time-scales and has global impacts although
originating in the tropical Pacific. Many point indices have been developed to
describe ENSO but the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) is considered the most
representative since it links six different meteorological parameters measured
over the tropical Pacific. Extreme values of MEI are correlated to the extreme
values of atmospheric CO2 concentration rate variations and negatively
correlated to equivalent scale extreme values of the length of day (LOD) rate
variation. We evaluate a first order conversion function between MEI and the
other two indexes using their annual rate of variation. The quantification of
the strength of the coupling herein evaluated provides a quantitative measure
to test the accuracy of theoretical model predictions. Our results further
confirm the idea that the major local and global Earth-atmosphere system
mechanisms are significantly coupled and synchronized to each other at multiple
scales.

    <title>Waving in the rain</title>
    <summary>  We consider the effect of rain on wind wave generation and dissipation. Rain
falling on a wavy surface may have a marked tendency to dampen the shorter
waves in the tail of the spectrum, the related range increasing with the rain
rate. Following the coupling between meteorological and wave models, we derive
that on the whole this should imply stronger wind and higher waves in the most
energetic part of the spectrum. This is supported by numerical experiments.
However, a verification based on the comparison between operational model
results and measured data suggests that the opposite is true. This leads to a
keen analysis of the overall process, in particular on the role of the tail of
the spectrum in modulating the wind input and the white-capping. We suggest
that the relationship between white-capping and generation by wind is deeper
and more implicative than presently generally assumed.

    <title>The affinely invariant distance correlation</title>
    <summary>  Sz\'{e}kely, Rizzo and Bakirov (Ann. Statist. 35 (2007) 2769-2794) and
Sz\'{e}kely and Rizzo (Ann. Appl. Statist. 3 (2009) 1236-1265), in two seminal
papers, introduced the powerful concept of distance correlation as a measure of
dependence between sets of random variables. We study in this paper an affinely
invariant version of the distance correlation and an empirical version of that
distance correlation, and we establish the consistency of the empirical
quantity. In the case of subvectors of a multivariate normally distributed
random vector, we provide exact expressions for the affinely invariant distance
correlation in both finite-dimensional and asymptotic settings, and in the
finite-dimensional case we find that the affinely invariant distance
correlation is a function of the canonical correlation coefficients. To
illustrate our results, we consider time series of wind vectors at the
Stateline wind energy center in Oregon and Washington, and we derive the
empirical auto and cross distance correlation functions between wind vectors at
distinct meteorological stations.

    <title>Probabilistic wind speed forecasting using Bayesian model averaging with
  truncated normal components</title>
    <summary>  Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a statistical method for post-processing
forecast ensembles of atmospheric variables, obtained from multiple runs of
numerical weather prediction models, in order to create calibrated predictive
probability density functions (PDFs). The BMA predictive PDF of the future
weather quantity is the mixture of the individual PDFs corresponding to the
ensemble members and the weights and model parameters are estimated using
ensemble members and validating observation from a given training period.
  In the present paper we introduce a BMA model for calibrating wind speed
forecasts, where the components PDFs follow truncated normal distribution with
cut-off at zero, and apply it to the ALADIN-HUNEPS ensemble of the Hungarian
Meteorological Service. Three parameter estimation methods are proposed and
each of the corresponding models outperforms the traditional gamma BMA model
both in calibration and in accuracy of predictions. Moreover, since here the
maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters does not require numerical
optimization, modelling can be performed much faster than in case of gamma
mixtures.

    <title>Universal inverse power-law distribution for temperature and rainfall in
  the UK region</title>
    <summary>  Meteorological parameters, such as temperature, rainfall, pressure etc.,
exhibit selfsimilar space-time fractal fluctuations generic to dynamical
systems in nature such as fluid flows, spread of forest fires, earthquakes,
etc. The power spectra of fractal fluctuations display inverse power-law form
signifying long-range correlations. The author has developed a general systems
theory which predicts universal inverse power-law form incorporating the golden
mean for the fractal fluctuations of all size scales, i.e., small, large and
extreme values. The model predicted distribution is in close agreement with
observed fractal fluctuations in the historic month-wise temperature (maximum
and minimum) and rainfall in the UK region. The present study suggests that
fractal fluctuations result from the superimposition of an eddy continuum
fluctuations. The observed extreme values result from superimposition of maxima
(or minima) of dominant eddies (waves) in the eddy continuum.

    <title>Simulation of a typical house in the region of Antananarivo, Madagascar.
  Determination of passive solutions using local materials</title>
    <summary>  This paper deals with new proposals for the design of passive solutions
adapted to the climate of the highlands of Madagascar. While the strongest
population density is located in the central highlands, the problem of thermal
comfort in buildings occurs mainly during winter time. Currently, people use
raw wood to warm the poorly designed houses. This leads to a large scale
deforestation of the areas and causes erosion and environmental problems. The
methodology used consisted of the identification of a typical building and of a
typical meteorological year. Simulations were carried out using a thermal and
airflow software (CODYRUN) to improve each building component (roof, walls,
windows, and soil) in such a way as to estimate the influence of some technical
solutions on each component in terms of thermal comfort. The proposed solutions
also took into account the use of local materials and the standard of living of
the country.

    <title>From Predicting Solar Activity to Forecasting Space Weather: Practical
  Examples of Research-to-Operations and Operations-to-Research</title>
    <summary>  The successful transition of research to operations (R2O) and operations to
research (O2R) requires, above all, interaction between the two communities. We
explore the role that close interaction and ongoing communication played in the
successful fielding of three separate developments: an observation platform, a
numerical model, and a visualization and specification tool. Additionally, we
will examine how these three pieces came together to revolutionize
interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) arrival forecasts. A discussion of
the importance of education and training in ensuring a positive outcome from
R2O activity follows. We describe efforts by the meteorological community to
make research results more accessible to forecasters and the applicability of
these efforts to the transfer of space-weather research.We end with a
forecaster "wish list" for R2O transitions. Ongoing, two-way communication
between the research and operations communities is the thread connecting it
all.

    <title>Disperse two-phase flows, with applications to geophysical problems</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we study the motion of a fluid with several dispersed particles
whose concentration is very small (smaller than $10^{-3}$), with possible
applications to problems coming from geophysics, meteorology, and oceanography.
We consider a very dilute suspension of heavy particles in a
quasi-incompressible fluid (low Mach number). In our case the Stokes number is
small and --as pointed out in the theory of multiphase turbulence-- we can use
an Eulerian model instead of a Lagrangian one. The assumption of low
concentration allows us to disregard particle--particle interactions, but we
take into account the effect of particles on the fluid (two-way coupling). In
this way we can study the physical effect of particle inertia (and not only
passive tracers), with a model similar to the Boussinesq equations. The
resulting model is used in both direct numerical simulations and large eddy
simulations of a dam-break (lock-exchange) problem, which is a well-known
academic test case. Keywords: Dilute suspensions, Eulerian models, direct and
large eddy simulations, slightly compressible flows, dam-break (lock-exchange)
problem.

    <title>The available-enthalpy (flow-exergy) cycle. Part-I: introduction and
  basic equations</title>
    <summary>  A diagnostic package is derived from the concept of specific available
enthalpy, leading to the definition of a local and complete energy cycle. It is
useful to understand the transformations of energy occurring at any particular
pressure level or pressure layer of a limited area domain. The global version
of this diagnostic tool is very similar to the cycle of Lorenz, but the local
counterpart contains several additional terms, with zonal, eddy and
static-stability components close to definitions already given by Pearce. The
new cycle takes into account the flow of energy components across the vertical
and horizontal boundaries, with additional conversion terms involving potential
energy, leading to accurate computations of dissipation and generation terms
obtained as residuals. A new accurate temporal scheme is proposed in order to
allow use of a large time interval in future numerical applications. Finally,
comments are made on the arbitrary choice for two constant reference values for
pressure and temperature.

    <title>Effect of soil temperature on one-way optical frequency transfer through
  dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing fibre links</title>
    <summary>  Results of optical frequency transfer over a carrier-grade
dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) optical fibre network are
presented. The relation between soil temperature changes on a buried optical
fibre and frequency changes of an optical carrier through the fibre is
modelled. Soil temperatures, measured at various depths by the Royal
Netherlands Meteorology Institute (KNMI) are compared with observed frequency
variations through this model. A comparison of a nine-day record of optical
frequency measurements through the 2 x 298 km fibre link with soil temperature
data shows qualitative agreement. A soil temperature model is used to predict
the link stability over longer periods (days-months-years). We show that
one-way optical frequency dissemination is sufficiently stable to distribute
and compare e.g. rubidium frequency standards over standard DWDM optical fibre
networks.

    <title>Temperature variability over the Po Valley, Italy, according to
  radiosounding data</title>
    <summary>  Temperature variations registered above the southeast part of the Po Valley,
Italy have been examined by applying the principal component analysis of
radiosoung profiles recorded during the period from 1987 to 2010. Two data
sets, considered to describe intra- and inter-annual oscillations, respectively
were extracted from the measurements data and the results show that both types
of fluctuations can be projected onto four empirical orthogonal functions
(EOF), interpreted as vertical distributions of oscillation amplitudes and four
uncorrelated time series that represent the evolution of corresponding EOFs. It
was found that intra-annual oscillations composed of periods between 30 and 120
days, together with inter-annual variations of 1- to 7-year period contribute
to the highest extent (about 70 percents) the temperature oscillations up to 20
km, changing in both cases the phase in the tropopausal region. The other three
EOFs indicate prevailing weight of the oscillations in the upper
troposphere-low stratosphere region and are characterized by longer periods in
both types of fluctuations. The intra-annual variations can be accounted for an
interaction between Madden-Julian and Arctic oscillations, while the spectral
features of inter-annual fluctuations could be associated with those of Quasi
Biennial, El Nino and North Atlantic global oscillations.

    <title>What a Nasty day: Exploring Mood-Weather Relationship from Twitter</title>
    <summary>  While it has long been believed in psychology that weather somehow influences
human's mood, the debates have been going on for decades about how they are
correlated. In this paper, we try to study this long-lasting topic by
harnessing a new source of data compared from traditional psychological
researches: Twitter. We analyze 2 years' twitter data collected by twitter API
which amounts to $10\%$ of all postings and try to reveal the correlations
between multiple dimensional structure of human mood with meteorological
effects. Some of our findings confirm existing hypotheses, while others
contradict them. We are hopeful that our approach, along with the new data
source, can shed on the long-going debates on weather-mood correlation.

    <title>Convergent finite difference solvers for viscosity solutions of the
  elliptic Monge-Ampère equation in dimensions two and higher</title>
    <summary>  The elliptic Monge-Amp\`ere equation is a fully nonlinear Partial
Differential Equation that originated in geometric surface theory and has been
applied in dynamic meteorology, elasticity, geometric optics, image processing
and image registration. Solutions can be singular, in which case standard
numerical approaches fail. Novel solution methods are required for stability
and convergence to the weak (viscosity) solution.
  In this article we build a wide stencil finite difference discretization for
the \MA equation. The scheme is monotone, so the Barles-Souganidis theory
allows us to prove that the solution of the scheme converges to the unique
viscosity solution of the equation.
  Solutions of the scheme are found using a damped Newton's method. We prove
convergence of Newton's method and provide a systematic method to determine a
starting point for the Newton iteration.
  Computational results are presented in two and three dimensions, which
demonstrates the speed and accuracy of the method on a number of exact
solutions, which range in regularity from smooth to non-differentiable.

    <title>Atmospheric Response to Fukushima Daiichi NPP (Japan) Accident Reviled
  by Satellite and Ground observations</title>
    <summary>  Immediately after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan we
started to continuously survey the Outgoing Long-wavelength Radiation (OLR,
10-13 microns) from NOAA/AVHRR. Our preliminary results show the presence of
hot spots on the top of the atmosphere over the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power
Plant (FDNPP) and due to their persistence over the same region they are most
likely not of meteorological origin. On March 14 and 21 we detected a
significant increase in radiation (14 W/m2) at the top of the atmosphere which
also coincides with a reported radioactivity gas leaks from the FDNPP. After
March 21 the intensity of OLR started to decline, which has been confirmed by
ground radiometer network. We hypothesize that this increase in OLR was a
result of the radioactive leaks released in atmosphere from the FDNPP. This
energy triggers ionization of the air near the ground and lead to release of
latent heat energy due to change of air humidity and temperature. Our early
results demonstrate the potential of the latest development in atmospheric
sciences and space-borne observations for monitoring nuclear accidents.

    <title>Efficient particle filtering through residual nudging</title>
    <summary>  We introduce an auxiliary technique, called residual nudging, to the particle
filter to enhance its performance in cases that it performs poorly. The main
idea of residual nudging is to monitor, and if necessary, adjust the residual
norm of a state estimate in the observation space so that it does not exceed a
pre-specified threshold. We suggest a rule to choose the pre-specified
threshold, and construct a state estimate accordingly to achieve this
objective. Numerical experiments suggest that introducing residual nudging to a
particle filter may (substantially) improve its performance, in terms of filter
accuracy and/or stability against divergence, especially when the particle
filter is implemented with a relatively small number of particles.

    <title>Variance estimation for Brier Score decomposition</title>
    <summary>  The Brier Score is a widely-used criterion to assess the quality of
probabilistic predictions of binary events. The expectation value of the Brier
Score can be decomposed into the sum of three components called reliability,
resolution, and uncertainty which characterize different forecast attributes.
Given a dataset of forecast probabilities and corresponding binary
verifications, these three components can be estimated empirically. Here,
propagation of uncertainty is used to derive expressions that approximate the
sampling variances of the estimated components. Variance estimates are provided
for both the traditional estimators, as well as for refined estimators that
include a bias correction. Applications of the derived variance estimates to
artificial data illustrate their validity, and application to a meteorological
prediction problem illustrates a possible use case. The observed increase of
variance of the bias-corrected estimators is discussed.

    <title>Algorithm and approaches to handle large Data- A Survey</title>
    <summary>  Data mining environment produces a large amount of data, that need to be
analyzed, patterns have to be extracted from that to gain knowledge. In this
new era with boom of data both structured and unstructured, in the field of
genomics, meteorology, biology, environmental research and many others, it has
become difficult to process, manage and analyze patterns using traditional
databases and architectures. So, a proper architecture should be understood to
gain knowledge about the Big Data. This paper presents a review of various
algorithms from 1994-2013 necessary for handling such large data set. These
algorithms define various structures and methods implemented to handle Big
Data, also in the paper are listed various tool that were developed for
analyzing them.

    <title>Data-driven modeling of systemic delay propagation under severe
  meteorological conditions</title>
    <summary>  The upsetting consequences of weather conditions are well known to any person
involved in air transportation. Still the quantification of how these
disturbances affect delay propagation and the effectiveness of managers and
pilots interventions to prevent possible large-scale system failures needs
further attention. In this work, we employ an agent-based data-driven model
developed using real flight performance registers for the entire US airport
network and focus on the events occurring on October 27 2010 in the United
States. A major storm complex that was later called the 2010 Superstorm took
place that day. Our model correctly reproduces the evolution of the
delay-spreading dynamics. By considering different intervention measures, we
can even improve the model predictions getting closer to the real delay data.
Our model can thus be of help to managers as a tool to assess different
intervention measures in order to diminish the impact of disruptive conditions
in the air transport system.

    <title>A review of the relevance of the 'CLOUD' results and other recent
  observations to the possible effect of cosmic rays on the terrestrial climate</title>
    <summary>  The problem of the contribution of cosmic rays to climate change is a
continuing one and one of importance. In principle, at least, the recent
results from the CLOUD project at CERN provide information about the role of
ionizing particles in 'sensitizing' atmospheric aerosols which might, later,
give rise to cloud droplets. Our analysis shows that, although important in
cloud physics the results do not lead to the conclusion that cosmic rays affect
atmospheric clouds significantly, at least if H2SO4 is the dominant source of
aerosols in the atmosphere. An analysis of the very recent studies of
stratospheric aerosol changes following a giant solar energetic particles event
shows a similar negligible effect. Recent measurements of the cosmic ray
intensity show that a former decrease with time has been reversed. Thus, even
if cosmic rays enhanced cloud production, there will be a small global cooling,
not warming.

    <title>First on-sky results of the CO-SLIDAR Cn2 profiler</title>
    <summary>  COupled SLope and scIntillation Detection And Ranging (CO-SLIDAR) is a recent
profiling method of the vertical distribution of atmospheric turbulence
strength ($C_n^2$ profile). It takes advantage of correlations of slopes and of
scintillation, both measured with a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor on a binary
star.
  In this paper, we present the improved CO-SLIDAR reconstruction method of the
$C_n^2$ profile and the first on-sky results of the CO-SLIDAR profiler. We
examine CO-SLIDAR latest performance in simulation, taking into account the
detection noise bias and estimating error bars along with the turbulence
profile. The estimated $C_n^2$ profiles demonstrate the accuracy of the
CO-SLIDAR method, showing sensitivity to both low and high altitude turbulent
layers. CO-SLIDAR is tested on-sky for the first time, on the $1.5$~m MeO
(M\'etrologie Optique) telescope at Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur (France).
  The reconstructed profiles are compared to turbulence profiles estimated from
meteorological data and a good agreement is found. We discuss CO-SLIDAR's
contribution in the $C_n^2$ profilers' landscape and we propose some
improvements of the instrument.

    <title>Global Atmospheric Models for Cosmic Ray Detectors</title>
    <summary>  The knowledge of atmospheric parameters -- such as temperature, pressure, and
humidity -- is very important for a proper reconstruction of air showers,
especially with the fluorescence technique. The Global Data Assimilation System
(GDAS) provides altitude-dependent profiles of these state variables of the
atmosphere and several more. Every three hours, a new data set on 23 constant
pressure level plus an additional surface values is available for the entire
globe. These GDAS data are now used in the standard air shower reconstruction
of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The validity of the data was verified by
comparisons with monthly models that were averaged from on-site meteorological
radio soundings and weather station measurements obtained at the Observatory in
Malarg\"ue. Comparisons of reconstructions using the GDAS data and the monthly
models are also presented. Since GDAS is a global model, the data can
potentially be used for other cosmic and gamma ray detectors. Several studies
were already performed or are underway for several locations worldwide. As an
example, a study performed in Colorado as part of an Atmospheric R&amp;D for a
possible future cosmic ray observatory is presented.

    <title>Sensitivity of Displaced-Beam Scintillometer Measurements of
  Area-Average Heat Fluxes to Uncertainties in Topographic Heights</title>
    <summary>  Displaced-beam scintillometer measurements of the turbulence inner-scale
length $l_o$ and refractive index structure function $C_n^2$ resolve
area-average turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum through the Monin-Obukhov
similarity equations. Sensitivity studies have been produced for the use of
displaced-beam scintillometers over flat terrain. Many real field sites feature
variable topography. We develop here an analysis of the sensitivity of
displaced-beam scintillometer derived sensible heat fluxes to uncertainties in
spacially distributed topographic measurements. Sensitivity is shown to be
concentrated in areas near the center of the beam and where the underlying
topography is closest to the beam height. Uncertainty may be decreased by
taking precise topographic measurements in these areas.

    <title>An error estimate of Gaussian Recursive Filter in 3Dvar problem</title>
    <summary>  Computational kernel of the three-dimensional variational data assimilation
(3D-Var) problem is a linear system, generally solved by means of an iterative
method. The most costly part of each iterative step is a matrix-vector product
with a very large covariance matrix having Gaussian correlation structure. This
operation may be interpreted as a Gaussian convolution, that is a very
expensive numerical kernel. Recursive Filters (RFs) are a well known way to
approximate the Gaussian convolution and are intensively applied in the
meteorology, in the oceanography and in forecast models. In this paper, we deal
with an oceanographic 3D-Var data assimilation scheme, named OceanVar, where
the linear system is solved by using the Conjugate Gradient (GC) method by
replacing, at each step, the Gaussian convolution with RFs. Here we give
theoretical issues on the discrete convolution approximation with a first order
(1st-RF) and a third order (3rd-RF) recursive filters. Numerical experiments
confirm given error bounds and show the benefits, in terms of accuracy and
performance, of the 3-rd RF.

    <title>Area Coverage Under Low Sensor Density</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a solution to the problem of monitoring a region of
interest (RoI) using a set of nodes that is not sufficient to achieve the
required degree of monitoring coverage. In particular, sensing coverage of
wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a crucial issue in projects due to failure
of sensors. The lack of sensor equipment resources hinders the traditional
method of using mobile robots to move around the RoI to collect readings.
Instead, our solution employs supervised neural networks to produce the values
of the uncovered locations by extracting the non-linear relation among randomly
deployed sensor nodes throughout the area. Moreover, we apply a hybrid
backpropagation method to accelerate the learning convergence speed to a local
minimum solution. We use a real-world data set from meteorological deployment
for experimental validation and analysis.

    <title>Predictive Capacity of Meteorological Data - Will it rain tomorrow</title>
    <summary>  With the availability of high precision digital sensors and cheap storage
medium, it is not uncommon to find large amounts of data collected on almost
all measurable attributes, both in nature and man-made habitats. Weather in
particular has been an area of keen interest for researchers to develop more
accurate and reliable prediction models. This paper presents a set of
experiments which involve the use of prevalent machine learning techniques to
build models to predict the day of the week given the weather data for that
particular day i.e. temperature, wind, rain etc., and test their reliability
across four cities in Australia {Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart}. The
results provide a comparison of accuracy of these machine learning techniques
and their reliability to predict the day of the week by analysing the weather
data. We then apply the models to predict weather conditions based on the
available data.

    <title>Short-Term Predictability of Photovoltaic Production over Italy</title>
    <summary>  Photovoltaic (PV) power production increased drastically in Europe throughout
the last years. About the 6% of electricity in Italy comes from PV and for an
efficient management of the power grid an accurate and reliable forecasting of
production would be needed. Starting from a dataset of electricity production
of 65 Italian solar plants for the years 2011-2012 we investigate the
possibility to forecast daily production from one to ten days of lead time
without using on site measurements. Our study is divided in two parts: an
assessment of the predictability of meteorological variables using weather
forecasts and an analysis on the application of data-driven modelling in
predicting solar power production. We calibrate a SVM model using available
observations and then we force the same model with the predicted variables from
weather forecasts with a lead time from one to ten days. As expected, solar
power production is strongly influenced by cloudiness and clear sky, in fact we
observe that while during summer we obtain a general error under the 10%
(slightly lower in south Italy), during winter the error is abundantly above
the 20%.

    <title>Linguistic Descriptions for Automatic Generation of Textual Short-Term
  Weather Forecasts on Real Prediction Data</title>
    <summary>  We present in this paper an application which automatically generates textual
short-term weather forecasts for every municipality in Galicia (NW Spain),
using the real data provided by the Galician Meteorology Agency (MeteoGalicia).
This solution combines in an innovative way computing with perceptions
techniques and strategies for linguistic description of data together with a
natural language generation (NLG) system. The application, named GALiWeather,
extracts relevant information from weather forecast input data and encodes it
into intermediate descriptions using linguistic variables and temporal
references. These descriptions are later translated into natural language texts
by the natural language generation system. The obtained forecast results have
been thoroughly validated by an expert meteorologist from MeteoGalicia using a
quality assessment methodology which covers two key dimensions of a text: the
accuracy of its content and the correctness of its form. Following this
validation GALiWeather will be released as a real service offering custom
forecasts for a wide public.

    <title>A model-free control strategy for an experimental greenhouse with an
  application to fault accommodation</title>
    <summary>  Writing down mathematical models of agricultural greenhouses and regulating
them via advanced controllers are challenging tasks since strong perturbations,
like meteorological variations, have to be taken into account. This is why we
are developing here a new model-free control approach and the corresponding
intelligent controllers, where the need of a good model disappears. This
setting, which has been introduced quite recently and is easy to implement, is
already successful in many engineering domains. Tests on a concrete greenhouse
and comparisons with Boolean controllers are reported. They not only
demonstrate an excellent climate control, where the reference may be modified
in a straightforward way, but also an efficient fault accommodation with
respect to the actuators.

    <title>Internal wave coupling processes in Earth's atmosphere</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a contemporary review of vertical coupling in the
atmosphere and ionosphere system induced by internal waves of lower atmospheric
origin. Atmospheric waves are primarily generated by meteorological processes,
possess a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, and can propagate to the
upper atmosphere. A brief summary of internal wave theory is given, focusing on
gravity waves, solar tides, planetary Rossby and Kelvin waves. Observations of
wave signatures in the upper atmosphere, their relationship with the direct
propagation of waves into the upper atmosphere, dynamical and thermal impacts
as well as concepts, approaches, and numerical modeling techniques are
outlined. Recent progress in studies of sudden stratospheric warming and upper
atmospheric variability are discussed in the context of wave-induced vertical
coupling between the lower and upper atmosphere.

    <title>Extremes on river networks</title>
    <summary>  Max-stable processes are the natural extension of the classical extreme-value
distributions to the functional setting, and they are increasingly widely used
to estimate probabilities of complex extreme events. In this paper we broaden
them from the usual situation in which dependence varies according to functions
of Euclidean distance to situations in which extreme river discharges at two
locations on a river network may be dependent because the locations are
flow-connected or because of common meteorological events. In the former case
dependence depends on river distance, and in the second it depends on the
hydrological distance between the locations, either of which may be very
different from their Euclidean distance. Inference for the model parameters is
performed using a multivariate threshold likelihood, which is shown by
simulation to work well. The ideas are illustrated with data from the upper
Danube basin.

    <title>Detecting distributional changes in samples of independent block maxima
  using probability weighted moments</title>
    <summary>  The analysis of seasonal or annual block maxima is of interest in fields such
as hydrology, climatology or meteorology. In connection with the celebrated
method of block maxima, we study several tests that can be used to assess
whether the available series of maxima is identically distributed. It is
assumed that block maxima are independent but not necessarily generalized
extreme value distributed. The asymptotic null distributions of the test
statistics are investigated and the practical computation of approximate
p-values is addressed. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations show the adequate
finite-sample behavior of the studied tests for a large number of realistic
data generating scenarios. Illustrations on several environmental datasets
conclude the work.

    <title>Feature-preserving interpolation and filtering of environmental time
  series</title>
    <summary>  We propose a method for filling gaps and removing interferences in time
series for applications involving continuous monitoring of environmental
variables. The approach is non-parametric and based on an iterative
pattern-matching between the affected and the valid parts of the time series.
It considers several variables jointly in the pattern matching process and
allows preserving linear or non-linear dependences between variables. The
uncertainty in the reconstructed time series is quantified through multiple
realizations. The method is tested on self-potential data that are affected by
strong interferences as well as data gaps, and the results show that our
approach allows reproducing the spectral features of the original signal. Even
in the presence of intense signal perturbations, it significantly improves the
signal and corrects bias introduced by asymmetrical interferences. Potential
applications are wide-ranging, including geophysics, meteorology and hydrology.

    <title>A complex network theory approach for the spatial distribution of fire
  breaks in heterogeneous forest landscapes for the control of wildland fires</title>
    <summary>  Based on complex network theory, we propose a computational methodology that
addresses the spatial distribution of fuel breaks for the inhibition of the
spread and size of wildland fires on heterogeneous landscapes. This is a
two-tire approach where the dynamics of fire spread are modeled as a random
Markov field process on a directed network whose edge weights, are provided by
a state-of-the-art cellular automata model that integrates detailed GIS,
landscape and meteorological data. Within this framework, the spatial
distribution of fuel breaks is reduced to the problem of finding the network
nodes among which the fire spreads faster, thus their removal favours the
inhibition of the fire propagation. Here this is accomplished exploiting the
information centrality statistics. We illustrate the proposed approach through
(a) an artificial forest of randomly distributed density of vegetation, and (b)
a real-world case concerning the island of Rhodes in Greece whose a major part
of its forest burned in 2008. Simulation results show that the methodology
outperforms significantly the benchmark tactic of random distribution of fuel
breaks.

    <title>A Cyberinfrastructure-based Approach to Real Time Water Temperature
  Prediction</title>
    <summary>  The prediction of water temperature is crucial for aquatic ecosystem studies
and management. In this paper, we raise challenging issues in supporting real
time water temperature prediction and present a system called WT-Agabus to
address those issues. The WT-Agabus system is designed to be a
cyberinfrastructure and to support various prediction models in a uniform way.
In addition, we present a neural network-based water temperature prediction
model to use only data available online from Korea Meteorological
Administration (KMA). In this paper, we also show the current prototype
implementation of the WT-Agabus system to support the prediction model

    <title>A New Method for Partial Correction of Residual Confounding in
  Time-Series and other Observational Studies</title>
    <summary>  Introduction: Methods now exist to detect residual confounding. One requires
an "indicator" with two key properties: conditional independence of the outcome
(given exposure and measured covariates) absent confounding and other model
miss-specification; and an association with unmeasured confounders (like the
exposure). We now present a new method for correcting for residual confounding
in time-series and other epidemiological studies. We argue that estimators from
models that include an indicator with these key properties should have less
bias than those from models without the indicator.
  Methods: Using causal reasoning and basic regression theory we present
theoretical arguments to support our claims. In simulations, we empirically
evaluate our approach using a time-series study of ozone effects on emergency
department visits for asthma (AV). We base simulations on observed data for
ozone, meteorological factors and asthma.
  Results: In simulations, results from models that included ozone
concentrations one day after the AV yielded effect estimators with slightly or
modestly less residual confounding.
  Conclusion: Theory and simulations show that including the indicator based on
future air pollution levels can reduce residual confounding. Our method differs
from available methods because it uses a regression approach involving an
exposure-based indicator rather than a negative outcome control.

    <title>Joint Investment and Operation of Microgrid</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for the joint optimization
of investment and operation of a microgrid, taking the impact of energy
storage, renewable energy integration, and demand response into consideration.
We first study the renewable energy generations in Hong kong, and identify the
potential benefit of mixed deployment of solar and wind energy generations.
Then we model the joint investment and operation as a two-period stochastic
programming program. In period-1, the microgrid operator makes the optimal
investment decisions on the capacities of solar power generation, wind power
generation, and energy storage. In period-2, the operator coordinates the power
supply and demand in the microgrid to minimize the operating cost. We design a
decentralized algorithm for computing the optimal pricing and power consumption
in period-2, based on which we solve the optimal investment problem in
period-1. We also study the impact of prediction error of renewable energy
generation on the portfolio investment using robust optimization framework.
Using realistic meteorological data obtained from the Hong Kong observatory, we
numerically characterize the optimal portfolio investment decisions, optimal
day-ahead pricing and power scheduling, and demonstrate the advantage of using
mixed renewable energy and demand response in terms of reducing investment
cost.

    <title>Partial Coherence Estimation via Spectral Matrix Shrinkage under
  Quadratic Loss</title>
    <summary>  Partial coherence is an important quantity derived from spectral or precision
matrices and is used in seismology, meteorology, oceanography, neuroscience and
elsewhere. If the number of complex degrees of freedom only slightly exceeds
the dimension of the multivariate stationary time series, spectral matrices are
poorly conditioned and shrinkage techniques suggest themselves. When true
partial coherencies are quite large then for shrinkage estimators of the
diagonal weighting kind it is shown empirically that the minimization of risk
using quadratic loss (QL) leads to oracle partial coherence estimators superior
to those derived by minimizing risk using Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) loss. When true
partial coherencies are small the methods behave similarly. We derive two new
QL estimators for spectral matrices, and new QL and HS estimators for precision
matrices. In addition for the full estimation (non-oracle) case where certain
trace expressions must also be estimated, we examine the behaviour of three
different QL estimators, the precision matrix one seeming particularly robust
and reliable. For the empirical study we carry out exact simulations derived
from real EEG data for two individuals, one having large, and the other small,
partial coherencies. This ensures our study covers cases of real-world
relevance.

    <title>A Time-varying Parameter Based Seasonally-adjusted Bayesian State-space
  Model for Forecasting</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we develop a time-varying parameter based seasonally-adjusted
Bayesian state-space model for non-stationary time series datasets where both
the trend and seasonal components are present and it is the general scenario
for most of the real datasets in various scientific disciplines. In spite of
removing such terms using some do-and-check procedure to make the data
stationary, our model directly fits a dataset and forecasts a number of future
observations. For a specific prior construction we have considered, every
parameter update is one-dimensional so that we don't need to invert any matrix
and also we overcome the difficulty of Metropolis-Hastings steps simply by
Gibbs sampling which is another advantage of this model. It can handle missing
data as well which occurs very often in time series contexts. We implement it
on the sufficiently large (24 years of monthly average temperature series, i.e.
the number of observations =288) for 57 meteorological stations across India
and show that for most of the cases, our method forecasts quite accurately for
the months of the 25-th year.

    <title>The Reflecting Heliometer of Rio de Janeiro after 6 Years of Activity</title>
    <summary>  Started its regular, daily operational phase in 2011 and installed in 2009 by
the occasion of the Symp264 in the XXVII IAU GA at Rio de Janeiro, the results
so far obtained show that the Heliometer of the Observatorio Nacional fulfilled
its planed performance of single measurement to the level of few tens of
milli-arcsecond, freely pivoting around the heliolatitudes without systematic
deviations or error enhancement. We present and discuss the astrometric
additions required on ground based astronomic programs. We also discuss
instrumental and observations terms, namely the constancy of the basic
heliometric angle, against which the measurements are made, and the
independence to meteorological and pointing conditions.

    <title>Astronomical Observing Conditions at Xinglong Observatory from 2007 to
  2014</title>
    <summary>  Xinglong Observatory of the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese
Academy of Sciences (NAOC), is one of the major optical observatories in China,
which hosts nine optical telescopes including the Large Sky Area Multi-Object
Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and the 2.16 m reflector. Scientific
research from these telescopes is focused on stars, galaxies, and exoplanets
using multicolor photometry and spectroscopic observations. Therefore, it is
important to provide the observing conditions of the site, in detail, to the
astronomers for an efficient use of these facilities. In this article, we
present the characterization of observing conditions at Xinglong Observatory
based on the monitoring of meteorology, seeing and sky brightness during the
period from 2007 to 2014. Results suggest that Xinglong Observatory is still a
good site for astronomical observations. Our analysis of the observing
conditions at Xinglong Observatory can be used as a reference to the observers
on targets selection, observing strategy, and telescope operation.

    <title>CoinCalc -- A new R package for quantifying simultaneities of event
  series</title>
    <summary>  We present the new R package CoinCalc for performing event coincidence
analysis (ECA), a novel statistical method to quantify the simultaneity of
events contained in two series of observations, either as simultaneous or
lagged coincidences within a user-specific temporal tolerance window. The
package also provides different analytical as well as surrogate-based
significance tests (valid under different assumptions about the nature of the
observed event series) as well as an intuitive visualization of the identified
coincidences. We demonstrate the usage of CoinCalc based on two typical
geoscientific example problems addressing the relationship between
meteorological extremes and plant phenology as well as that between soil
properties and land cover.

    <title>Constructing low-dimensional stochastic wind models through hierarchical
  spatial temporal decomposition</title>
    <summary>  Current wind turbine simulations successfully use turbulence generating tools
for modeling behavior. However, they lack the ability to reproduce
variabilities in wind dynamics and inherent stochastic structures (like
temporal and spatial coherences, sporadic bursts, high shear regions). This
necessitates a more realistic parameterization of the wind that encodes
location-, topography-, diurnal-, seasonal and stochastic affects. In this
work, we develop a hierarchical temporal and spatial decomposition (TSD) of
large-scale meteorology data to construct a low-dimensional yet realistic
stochastic wind flow model. Starting from a large data set (Crop Wind-energy
EXperiment), a low dimensional stochastic parameterization is constructed. The
resulting time-resolved stochastic model encodes the statistical behavior
exhibited by the actual wind flow. Moreover, the temporal modes encode the
variation of wind speed in the mean sense and resolve diurnal variations and
temporal correlation while the spatial modes provide deeper insight into
spatial coherence of the wind field - which is a key aspect in current wind
turbine sizing, design and classification. Comparison of several important
turbulent properties between the simulated wind flow and the original dataset
show the utility of the framework. We envision this framework as a useful
complement to existing wind simulation codes.

    <title>Cooperative Planning of Renewable Generations for Interconnected
  Microgrids</title>
    <summary>  We study the renewable energy generations in Hong Kong based on realistic
meteorological data, and find that different renewable sources exhibit diverse
time-varying and location-dependent profiles. To efficiently explore and
utilize the diverse renewable energy generations, we propose a theoretical
framework for the cooperative planning of renewable generations in a system of
interconnected microgrids. The cooperative framework considers the
self-interested behaviors of microgrids, and incorporates both their long-term
investment costs and short-term operational costs over the planning horizon.
Specifically, interconnected microgrids jointly decide where and how much to
deploy renewable energy generations, and how to split the associated investment
cost. We show that the cooperative framework minimizes the overall system cost.
We also design a fair cost sharing method based on Nash bargaining to
incentivize cooperative planning, such that all microgrids will benefit from
cooperative planning. Using realistic data obtained from the Hong Kong
observatory, we validate the cooperative planning framework, and demonstrate
that all microgrids benefit through the cooperation, and the overall system
cost is reduced by 35.9% compared to the noncooperative planning benchmark.

    <title>Quasi-geostrophic dynamics in the presence of moisture gradients</title>
    <summary>  The derivation of a quasi-geostrophic (QG) system from the rotating shallow
water equations on a midlatitude beta-plane coupled with moisture is presented.
Condensation is prescribed to occur whenever the moisture at a point exceeds a
prescribed saturation value. It is seen that a slow condensation time scale is
required to obtain a consistent set of equations at leading order. Further,
since the advecting wind fields are geostrophic, changes in moisture (and
hence, precipitation) occur only via non-divergent mechanisms. Following
observations, a saturation profile with gradients in the zonal and meridional
directions is prescribed. A purely meridional gradient has the effect of
slowing down the dry Rossby waves, through a reduction in the "equivalent
gradient" of the background potential vorticity. A large scale unstable moist
mode results on the inclusion of a zonal gradient by itself, or in conjunction
with a meridional moisture gradient. For gradients that are are representative
of the atmosphere, the most unstable moist mode propagates zonally in the
direction of increasing moisture, matures over an intraseasonal timescale and
has small phase speed.

    <title>UBL: an R package for Utility-based Learning</title>
    <summary>  This document describes the R package UBL that allows the use of several
methods for handling utility-based learning problems. Classification and
regression problems that assume non-uniform costs and/or benefits pose serious
challenges to predictive analytic tasks. In the context of meteorology,
finance, medicine, ecology, among many other, specific domain information
concerning the preference bias of the users must be taken into account to
enhance the models predictive performance. To deal with this problem, a large
number of techniques was proposed by the research community for both
classification and regression tasks. The main goal of UBL package is to
facilitate the utility-based predictive analytic task by providing a set of
methods to deal with this type of problems in the R environment. It is a
versatile tool that provides mechanisms to handle both regression and
classification (binary and multiclass) tasks. Moreover, UBL package allows the
user to specify his domain preferences, but it also provides some automatic
methods that try to infer those preference bias from the domain, considering
some common known settings.

    <title>Stochastic parameterization of subgrid-scale processes in coupled
  ocean-atmosphere systems: Benefits and limitations of response theory</title>
    <summary>  A stochastic subgrid-scale parameterization based on the Ruelle's response
theory and proposed in Wouters and Lucarini [2012] is tested in the context of
a low-order coupled ocean-atmosphere model for which a part of the atmospheric
modes are considered as unresolved. A natural separation of the phase-space
into an invariant set and its complement allows for an analytical derivation of
the different terms involved in the parameterization, namely the average, the
fluctuation and the long memory terms. In this case, the fluctuation term is an
additive stochastic noise. Its application to the low-order system reveals that
a considerable correction of the low-frequency variability along the invariant
subset can be obtained, provided that the coupling is sufficiently weak. This
new approach of scale separation opens new avenues of subgrid-scale
parameterizations in multiscale systems used for climate forecasts.

    <title>On the Calibration of Multilevel Monte Carlo Ensemble Forecasts</title>
    <summary>  Multilevel Monte Carlo can efficiently compute statistical estimates of
discretized random variables, for a given error tolerance. Traditionally, only
a certain statistic is computed from a particular implementation of multilevel
Monte Carlo. This paper considers the multilevel case when one wants to verify
and evaluate a single ensemble that forms an empirical approximation to many
different statistics, namely an ensemble forecast. We propose a simple
algorithm that, in the univariate case, allows one to derive a statistically
consistent single ensemble forecast from the hierarchy of ensembles that are
formed during an implementation of multilevel Monte Carlo. This ensemble
forecast then allows the entire multilevel hierarchy of ensembles to be
evaluated using standard ensemble forecast verification techniques. We
demonstrate the case of evaluating the calibration of the forecast in this
paper.

    <title>Generalised block bootstrap and its use in meteorology</title>
    <summary>  In an earlier paper Rakonczai et al. (2014), we have emphasized the effective
sample size for autocorrelated data. The simulations were based on the block
bootstrap methodology. However, the discreteness of the usual block size did
not allow for exact calculations. In this paper we propose a generalisation of
the block bootstrap methodology, relate it to the existing optimisation
procedures and apply it to a temperature data set. Our other focus is on
statistical tests, where quite often the actual sample size plays an important
role, even in case of relatively large samples. This is especially the case for
copulas. These are used for investigating the dependencies among data sets. As
in quite a few real applications the time dependence cannot be neglected, we
investigated the effect of this phenomenon to the used test statistic. The
critical values can be computed by the proposed new block bootstrap simulation,
where the block sizes are determined e.g. by fitting a VAR model to the
observations. The results are illustrated for models of the used temperature
data.

    <title>On the Charney Conjecture of Data Assimilation Employing Temperature
  Measurements Alone: The Paradigm of 3D Planetary Geostrophic Model</title>
    <summary>  Analyzing the validity and success of a data assimilation algorithm when some
state variable observations are not available is an important problem in
meteorology and engineering. We present an improved data assimilation algorithm
for recovering the exact full reference solution (i.e. the velocity and
temperature) of the 3D Planetary Geostrophic model, at an exponential rate in
time, by employing coarse spatial mesh observations of the temperature alone.
This provides, in the case of this paradigm, a rigorous justification to an
earlier conjecture of Charney which states that temperature history of the
atmosphere, for certain simple atmospheric models, determines all other state
variables.

    <title>Thermal Infrared Sky Background for a High-Arctic Mountain Observatory</title>
    <summary>  Nighttime zenith sky spectral brightness in the 3.3 to 20 micron wavelength
region is reported for an observatory site nearby Eureka, on Ellesmere Island
in the Canadian High Arctic. Measurements derive from an automated
Fourier-transform spectrograph which operated continuously there over three
consecutive winters. During that time the median through the most transparent
portion of the Q window was 460 Jy/square-arcsec, falling below 32
Jy/square-arcsec in N band, and to sub-Jansky levels by M and shortwards;
reaching only 36 mJy/square-arcsec within L. Nearly six decades of twice-daily
balloonsonde launches from Eureka, together with contemporaneous meteorological
data plus a simple model allows characterization of background stability and
extrapolation into K band. This suggests the study location has dark skies
across the whole thermal infrared spectrum, typically sub-200
micro-Jy/square-arcsec at 2.4 microns. That background is comparable to South
Pole, and more than an order of magnitude less than estimates for the best
temperate astronomical sites, all at much higher elevation. Considerations
relevant to future facilities, including for polar transient surveys, are
discussed.

    <title>A clustering-based data reduction for very large spatio-temporal
  datasets</title>
    <summary>  Today, huge amounts of data are being collected with spatial and temporal
components from sources such as meteorological, satellite imagery etc.
Efficient visualisation as well as discovery of useful knowledge from these
datasets is therefore very challenging and becoming a massive economic need.
Data Mining has emerged as the technology to discover hidden knowledge in very
large amounts of data. Furthermore, data mining techniques could be applied to
decrease the large size of raw data by retrieving its useful knowledge as
representatives. As a consequence, instead of dealing with a large size of raw
data, we can use these representatives to visualise or to analyse without
losing important information. This paper presents a new approach based on
different clustering techniques for data reduction to help analyse very large
spatio-temporal data. We also present and discuss preliminary results of this
approach.

    <title>A Spatio-Temporal Modeling Approach for Weather Radar Reflectivity Data
  and Its Applications in Tropical Southeast Asia</title>
    <summary>  Weather radar echoes, correlated in both space and time, are the most
important input data for short-term precipitation forecast. Motivated by real
datasets, this paper is concerned with the spatio-temporal modeling of
two-dimensional radar reflectivity fields from a sequence of radar images.
Under a Lagrangian integration scheme, we model the radar reflectivity data by
a spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive process which is driven by two
hidden sub-processes. The first sub-process is the dynamic velocity field which
determines the motion of the weather system, while the second sub-process
governs the growth or decay of the strength of radar reflectivity. The proposed
method is demonstrated, and compared with existing methods, using the real
radar data collected from the tropical southeast Asia. Note that, since the
tropical storms are known to be highly chaotic and extremely difficult to be
predicted, we only focus on the modeling of reflectivity data within a
short-period of time and consider the short-term prediction problem based on
the proposed model. This is often referred to as the nowcasting issue in the
meteorology society.

    <title>Streamflow forecasting using functional regression</title>
    <summary>  Streamflow, as a natural phenomenon, is continuous in time and so are the
meteorological variables which influence its variability. In practice, it can
be of interest to forecast the whole flow curve instead of points (daily or
hourly). To this end, this paper introduces the functional linear models and
adapts it to hydrological forecasting. More precisely, functional linear models
are regression models based on curves instead of single values. They allow to
consider the whole process instead of a limited number of time points or
features. We apply these models to analyse the flow volume and the whole
streamflow curve during a given period by using precipitations curves. The
functional model is shown to lead to encouraging results. The potential of
functional linear models to detect special features that would have been hard
to see otherwise is pointed out. The functional model is also compared to the
artificial neural network approach and the advantages and disadvantages of both
models are discussed. Finally, future research directions involving the
functional model in hydrology are presented.

    <title>Predicting seasonal influenza transmission using Regression Models with
  Temporal Dependence</title>
    <summary>  In this manuscript, we use meteorological information in Galicia (Spain) to
propose a novel approach to predict the incidence of influenza. Our approach
extends the GLS methods in the multivariate framework to functional regression
models with dependent errors. A simulation study shows that the GLS estimators
render better estimations of the parameters associated with the regression
model and obtain extremely good results from the predictive point of view. Thus
they improve the classical linear approach. It proposes an iterative version of
the GLS estimator (called iGLS) that can help to model complicated dependence
structures, uses the distance correlation measure $\mathcal{R}$ to select
relevant information to predict influenza rate and applies the GLS procedure to
the prediction of the influenza rate using readily available functional
variables. These kinds of models are extremely useful to health managers in
allocating resources in advance for an epidemic outbreak.

    <title>Statistical regionalization for estimation of extreme river discharges</title>
    <summary>  Regionalization methods have long been used to estimate high return levels of
river discharges at ungauged locations on a river network. In these methods,
the recorded discharge measurements of a group of similar, gauged, stations is
used to estimate high quantiles at the target catchment that has no
observations. This group is called the region of influence and its similarity
to the ungauged location is measured in terms of physical and meteorological
catchment attributes. We develop a statistical method for estimation of high
return levels based on regionalizing the parameters of a generalized extreme
value distribution. The region of influence is chosen in an optimal way,
ensuring similarity and in-group homogeneity. Our method is applied to
discharge data from the Rhine basin in Switzerland, and its performance at
ungauged locations is compared to that of classical regionalization methods.
For gauged locations we show how our approach improves the estimation
uncertainty for long return periods by combining local measurements with those
from the region of influence.

    <title>Predictive, finite-sample model choice for time series under
  stationarity and non-stationarity</title>
    <summary>  In statistical research there usually exists a choice between structurally
simpler or more complex models. We argue that, even if a more complex, locally
stationary time series model were true, then a simple, stationary time series
model may be advantageous to work with under parameter uncertainty. We present
a new model choice methodology, where one of two competing approaches is chosen
based on its empirical finite-sample performance with respect to prediction. A
rigorous, theoretical analysis of the procedure is provided. As an important
side result we prove, for possibly diverging model order, that the localised
Yule-Walker estimator is strongly, uniformly consistent under local
stationarity. An R package, forecastSNSTS, is provided and used to apply the
methodology to financial and meteorological data in empirical examples. We
further provide an extensive simulation study and discuss when it is preferable
to base forecasts on the more volatile time-varying estimates and when it is
advantageous to forecast as if the data were from a stationary process, even
though they might not be.

    <title>Prediction of Seasonal Temperature Using Soft Computing Techniques:
  Application in Benevento (Southern Italy) Area</title>
    <summary>  In this work two soft computing methods, Artificial Neural Networks and
Genetic Programming, are proposed in order to forecast the mean temperature
that will occur in future seasons. The area in which the soft computing
techniques were applied is that of the surroundings of the town of Benevento,
in the south of Italy, having geographic coordinates (lat. 41{\deg}07'50"N;
long.14{\deg}47'13"E). This area is not affected by maritime influences as well
as by winds coming from the west. The methods are fed by data recorded in the
meteorological stations of Benevento and Castelvenere, located in the hilly
area, which characterizes the territory surrounding this city, at 144 m a.s.l.
Both the applied methods show low error rates, while the Genetic Programming
offers an explicit rule representation (a formula) explaining the prevision.

    <title>Spontaneous mirror-symmetry breaking induces inverse energy cascade in
  3D active fluids</title>
    <summary>  Classical turbulence theory assumes that energy transport in a 3D turbulent
flow proceeds through a Richardson cascade whereby larger vortices successively
decay into smaller ones. By contrast, an additional inverse cascade
characterized by vortex growth exists in 2D fluids and gases, with profound
implications for meteorological flows and fluid mixing. The possibility of a
helicity-driven inverse cascade in 3D fluids had been rejected in the 1970s
based on equilibrium-thermodynamic arguments. Recently, however, it was
proposed that certain symmetry-breaking processes could potentially trigger a
3D inverse cascade, but no physical system exhibiting this phenomenon has been
identified to date. Here, we present analytical and numerical evidence for the
existence of an inverse energy cascade in an experimentally validated 3D active
fluid model, describing microbial suspension flows that spontaneously break
mirror symmetry. We show analytically that self-organized scale selection, a
generic feature of many biological and engineered nonequilibrium fluids, can
generate parity-violating Beltrami flows. Our simulations further demonstrate
how active scale selection controls mirror-symmetry breaking and the emergence
of a 3D inverse cascade.

    <title>A New Class of Generalized Burr III Distribution for Lifetime Data</title>
    <summary>  For the first time, the Generalized Gamma Burr III (GGBIII) is introduced as
an important model for problems in several areas such as actuarial sciences,
meteorology, economics, finance, environmental studies, reliability, and
censored data in survival analysis. A review of some existing gamma families
have been presented. It was found that the distributions cannot exhibit
complicated shapes such as unimodal and modified unimodal shapes which are very
common in medical field. The Generalized Gamma Burr III (GGBIII) distribution
which includes the family of Zografos and Balakrishnan as special cases is
proposed and studied. It is expressed as the linear combination of Burr III
distribution and it has a tractable properties. Some mathematical properties of
the new distribution including hazard, survival, reverse hazard rate function,
moments, moments generating function, mean and median deviations, distribution
of the order statistics are presented. Maximum likelihood estimation technique
is used to estimate the model parameters and applications to real datasets in
order to illustrate the usefulness of the model are presented. Examples and
applications as well as comparisons of the GGBIII to the existing Gamma-G
families are given.

    <title>Rayleigh-Bènard convection in the generalized Oberbeck-Boussinesq
  system</title>
    <summary>  The original Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) equations which are the coupled two
dimensional Navier-Stokes(NS) and heat conduction equations have been
investigated by E.N. Lorenz half a century ago with Fourier series and opened
the way to the paradigm of chaos. In our former study-Chaos, Solitons and
Fractals78, 249 (2015)-we presented fully analytic solutions for the velocity,
pressure and temperature fields with the aim of the self-similar Ansatz and
gave a possible explanation of the Rayleigh--B\`enard convection cells. Now we
generalize the Oberbeck-Boussinesq hydrodynamical system, going beyond the
first order Boussinesq approximation and consider a non-linear temperature
coupling. We investigate more general, power law dependent fluid viscosity or
heat conduction material equations as well. Our analytic results obtained via
the self-similar Ansatz may attract the interest of various fields like
meteorology, oceanography or climate studies.

    <title>Bootstrapping kernel intensity estimation for nonhomogeneous point
  processes depending on spatial covariates</title>
    <summary>  In the spatial point process context, kernel intensity estimation has been
mainly restricted to exploratory analysis due to its lack of consistency.
However the use of covariates has allowed to design consistent kernel
estimators under some restrictive assumptions. In this paper we focus on
de\-fi\-ning a theoretical framework to derive a consistent kernel intensity
estimator using covariates, as well as a consistent smooth bootstrap procedure.
We define two new data-driven bandwidth selectors specifically designed for our
estimator: a rule-of-thumb and a plug-in bandwidth based on our consistent
bootstrap method. A simulation study is accomplished to understand the
behaviour of our proposals in finite samples. Finally, we describe an
application to a real data set consisting of the wildfires in Canada during
June 2015, using meteorological information as covariates.

    <title>The pipeline for the ExoMars DREAMS scientific data archiving</title>
    <summary>  DREAMS (Dust Characterisation, Risk Assessment, and Environment Analyser on
the Martian Surface) is a payload accommodated on the Schiaparelli Entry and
Descent Module (EDM) of ExoMars 2016, the ESA and Roscosmos mission to Mars
(Esposito (2015), Bettanini et al. (2014)). It is a meteorological station with
the additional capability to perform measure- ments of the atmospheric electric
fields close to the surface of Mars. The instrument package will make the first
measurements of electric fields on Mars, providing data that will be of value
in planning the second ExoMars mission in 2020, as well as possible future
human missions to the red planet. This paper describes the pipeline to convert
the raw telemetries to the final data products for the archive, with associated
metadata.

    <title>Neural Machine Translation between Herbal Prescriptions and Diseases</title>
    <summary>  The current study applies deep learning to herbalism. Toward the goal, we
acquired the de-identified health insurance reimbursements that were claimed in
a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013 in the National Health Insurance Database of
Taiwan, the total number of reimbursement records equaling 340 millions. Two
artificial intelligence techniques were applied to the dataset: residual
convolutional neural network multitask classifier and attention-based recurrent
neural network. The former works to translate from herbal prescriptions to
diseases; and the latter from diseases to herbal prescriptions. Analysis of the
classification results indicates that herbal prescriptions are specific to:
anatomy, pathophysiology, sex and age of the patient, and season and year of
the prescription. Further analysis identifies temperature and gross domestic
product as the meteorological and socioeconomic factors that are associated
with herbal prescriptions. Analysis of the neural machine transitional result
indicates that the recurrent neural network learnt not only syntax but also
semantics of diseases and herbal prescriptions.

    <title>An intercomparison of monthly surface air temperature on islands and
  proximate moorings across the tropical Indo-Pacific</title>
    <summary>  Despite the importance and vulnerability of small island nations and their
ecosystems, they frequently have insufficient observations to provide baseline
or long-term perspectives on climate variability and change, and global model
experiments rarely have the resolution to include them. Many studies in
observational climatology, climate modeling, and paleoclimate thus depend to
varying degrees on an approximation equating near-surface marine and
terrestrial island climates, often with direct implications for island
societies and resources. Here we investigate the validity of this
approximation, and by extension the viability of offshore moorings to serve as
proxies for island climate variability, by comparing monthly mean observations
on a diverse set of 17 islands across the global tropics with those from ocean
moorings proximate to each island. While some island-mooring pairs exhibit a
mean offset in surface air temperature, these cannot be explained as a simple
function of one parameter including distance from the mooring, station
elevation, or island dimensions. Overall, the seasonal to interannual
variability in near-surface climate at monthly time scales at meteorological
stations on tropical islands is captured remarkably well by moorings positioned
up to 1,000 km offshore.

    <title>Balanced data assimilation for highly-oscillatory mechanical systems</title>
    <summary>  Data assimilation algorithms are used to estimate the states of a dynamical
system using partial and noisy observations. The ensemble Kalman filter has
become a popular data assimilation scheme due to its simplicity and robustness
for a wide range of application areas. Nevertheless, the ensemble Kalman filter
also has limitations due to its inherent Gaussian and linearity assumptions.
These limitations can manifest themselves in dynamically inconsistent state
estimates. We investigate this issue in this paper for highly oscillatory
Hamiltonian systems with a dynamical behavior which satisfies certain balance
relations. We first demonstrate that the standard ensemble Kalman filter can
lead to estimates which do not satisfy those balance relations, ultimately
leading to filter divergence. We also propose two remedies for this phenomenon
in terms of blended time-stepping schemes and ensemble-based penalty methods.
The effect of these modifications to the standard ensemble Kalman filter are
discussed and demonstrated numerically for two model scenarios. First, we
consider balanced motion for highly oscillatory Hamiltonian systems and,
second, we investigate thermally embedded highly oscillatory Hamiltonian
systems. The first scenario is relevant for applications from meteorology while
the second scenario is relevant for applications of data assimilation to
molecular dynamics.

    <title>Analysis of Annual Cyclone Frequencies over Bay of Bengal: Effect of
  2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami</title>
    <summary>  This paper discusses the time series trend and variability of the cyclone
frequencies over Bay of Bengal, particularly in order to conclude if there is
any significant difference in the pattern visible before and after the
disastrous 2004 Indian ocean tsunami based on the observed annual cyclone
frequency data obtained by India Meteorological Department over the years
1891-2015. Three different categories of cyclones- depression (&lt;34 knots),
cyclonic storm (34-47 knots) and severe cyclonic storm (&gt;47 knots) have been
analyzed separately using a non-homogeneous Poisson process approach. The
estimated intensity functions of the Poisson processes along with their first
two derivatives are discussed and all three categories show decreasing trend of
the intensity functions after the tsunami. Using an exact change-point
analysis, we show that the drops in mean intensity functions are significant
for all three categories. As of author's knowledge, no study so far have
discussed the relation between cyclones and tsunamis. Bay of Bengal is
surrounded by one of the most densely populated areas of the world and any kind
of significant change in tropical cyclone pattern has a large impact in various
ways, for example, disaster management planning and our study is immensely
important from that perspective.

    <title>BAMBI: An R package for Fitting Bivariate Angular Mixture Models</title>
    <summary>  Statistical analyses of directional or angular data have applications in a
variety of fields, such as geology, meteorology and bioinformatics. There is
substantial literature on descriptive and inferential techniques for univariate
angular data, with the bivariate (or more generally, multivariate) cases
receiving more attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of software
implementing inferential techniques in practice, especially in the bivariate
situation. In this article, we introduce BAMBI, an R package for analyzing
bivariate (and univariate) angular data using Bayesian methods. In this R
package, we implement three bivariate (viz., bivariate wrapped normal, von
Mises sine and von Mises cosine) and two univariate (viz., univariate wrapped
normal and von Mises) angular distributions. BAMBI provides Bayesian methods
for modeling angular data using finite mixtures of these distributions. We also
provide functions for visual and numerical diagnostics and Bayesian inference
for the fitted models. In this article, we first provide a brief review of the
distributions and techniques used in BAMBI, then describe the capabilities of
the package, and finally conclude with demonstrations of mixture model fitting
using BAMBI on the two real datasets included in the package, one univariate
and one bivariate.

    <title>Modeling Sheep pox Disease from the 1994-1998 Epidemic in Evros
  Prefecture, Greece</title>
    <summary>  Sheep pox is a highly transmissible disease which can cause serious loss of
livestock and can therefore have major economic impact. We present data from
sheep pox epidemics which occurred between 1994 and 1998. The data include
weekly records of infected farms as well as a number of covariates. We
implement Bayesian stochastic regression models which, in addition to various
explanatory variables like seasonal and environmental/meteorological factors,
also contain serial correlation structure based on variants of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We take a predictive view in model selection by
utilizing deviance-based measures. The results indicate that seasonality and
the number of infected farms are important predictors for sheep pox incidence.

    <title>A Data Mining Approach Combining K-Means Clustering with Bagging Neural
  Network for Short-term Wind Power Forecasting</title>
    <summary>  Wind power forecasting (WPF) is significant to guide the dispatching of grid
and the production planning of wind farm effectively. The intermittency and
volatility of wind leading to the diversity of the training samples have a
major impact on the forecasting accuracy. In this paper, to deal with the
training samples dynamics and improve the forecasting accuracy, a data mining
approach consisting of K-means clustering and bagging neural network is
proposed for short-term WPF. Based on the similarity among historical days,
K-means clustering is used to classify the samples into several categories,
which contain the information of meteorological conditions and historical power
data. In order to overcome the over fitting and instability problems of
conventional networks, a bagging-based ensemble approach is integrated into the
back propagation neural network. To confirm the effectiveness, the proposed
data mining approach is examined on real wind generation data traces. The
simulation results show that it can obtain better forecasting accuracy than
other baseline and existed short-term WPF approaches.

    <title>Estimating regional ground-level PM2.5 directly from satellite
  top-of-atmosphere reflectance using deep learning</title>
    <summary>  Almost all remote sensing atmospheric PM2.5 estimation methods need satellite
aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, which are often retrieved from
top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance via an atmospheric radiative transfer
model. Then, is it possible to estimate ground-level PM2.5 directly from
satellite TOA reflectance without a physical model? In this study, this
challenging work are achieved based on a machine learning model. Specifically,
we establish the relationship between PM2.5, satellite TOA reflectance,
observation angles, and meteorological factors in a deep learning architecture
(denoted as Ref-PM modeling). Taking the Wuhan Urban Agglomeration (WUA) as a
case study, the results demonstrate that compared with the AOD-PM modeling, the
Ref-PM modeling obtains a competitive performance, with out-of-sample
cross-validated R2 and RMSE values of 0.87 and 9.89 ug/m3 respectively. Also,
the TOA-reflectance-derived PM2.5 have a finer resolution and larger spatial
coverage than the AOD-derived PM2.5. This work updates the traditional
cognition of remote sensing PM2.5 estimation and has the potential to promote
the application in atmospheric environmental monitoring.

    <title>Management of solar energy in microgrids using IoT-based dependable
  control</title>
    <summary>  Solar energy generation requires efficient monitoring and management in
moving towards technologies for net-zero energy buildings. This paper presents
a dependable control system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to control
and manage the energy flow of renewable energy collected by solar panels within
a microgrid. Data for optimal control include not only measurements from local
sensors but also meteorological information retrieved in real-time from online
sources. For system fault tolerance across the whole distributed control system
featuring multiple controllers, dependable controllers are developed to control
and optimise the tracking performance of photovoltaic arrays to maximally
capture solar radiation and maintain system resilience and reliability in real
time despite failures of one or more redundant controllers due to a problem
with communication, hardware or cybersecurity. Experimental results have been
obtained to evaluate the validity of the proposed approach.

    <title>Learning the seasonality of disease incidences from empirical data</title>
    <summary>  Investigating the seasonality of disease incidences is very important in
disease surveillance in regions with periodical climatic patterns. In lieu of
the paradigm about disease incidences varying seasonally in line with
meteorology, this work seeks to determine how well standard epidemic models can
capture such seasonality for better forecasts and optimal futuristic
interventions. Once incidence data are assimilated by a periodic model,
asymptotic analysis in relation to the long-term behavior of the disease
occurrences can be performed using the classical Floquet theory, which explains
the stability of the existing periodic solutions. For a test case, we employed
an IR model to assimilate weekly dengue incidence data from the city of
Jakarta, Indonesia, which we present in their raw and moving-average-filtered
versions. To estimate a periodic parameter toward performing the asymptotic
analysis, eight optimization schemes were assigned returning magnitudes of the
parameter that vary insignificantly across schemes. Furthermore, the
computation results combined with the analytical results indicate that if the
disease surveillance in the city does not improve, then the incidence will
raise to a certain positive orbit and remain cyclical.

    <title>On the link between atmospheric cloud parameters and cosmic rays</title>
    <summary>  We herewith attempt to investigate the cosmic rays behavior regarding the
scaling features of their time series. Our analysis is based on cosmic ray
observations made at four neutron monitor stations in Athens (Greece), Jung
(Switzerland) and Oulu (Finland), for the period 2000 to early 2017. Each of
these datasets was analyzed by using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) in order to
investigate intrinsic properties, like self-similarity and the spectrum of
singularities. The main result obtained is that the cosmic rays time series at
all the neutron monitor stations exhibit positive long-range correlations (of
1/f type) with multifractal behavior. On the other hand, we try to investigate
the possible existence of similar scaling features in the time series of other
meteorological parameters which are closely associated with the cosmic rays,
such as parameters describing physical properties of clouds.

    <title>An iterative ensemble Kalman filter in presence of additive model error</title>
    <summary>  The iterative ensemble Kalman filter (IEnKF) in a deterministic framework was
introduced in Sakov et al. (2012) to extend the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)
and improve its performance in mildly up to strongly nonlinear cases.
  However, the IEnKF assumes that the model is perfect. This assumption
simplified the update of the system at a time different from the observation
time, which made it natural to apply the IEnKF for smoothing. In this study, we
generalise the IEnKF to the case of imperfect model with additive model error.
  The new method called IEnKF-Q conducts a Gauss-Newton minimisation in
ensemble space. It combines the propagated analysed ensemble anomalies from the
previous cycle and model noise ensemble anomalies into a single ensemble of
anomalies, and by doing so takes an algebraic form similar to that of the
IEnKF. The performance of the IEnKF-Q is tested in a number of experiments with
the Lorenz-96 model, which show that the method consistently outperforms both
the EnKF and the IEnKF naively modified to accommodate additive model noise.

    <title>A nestable, multigrid-friendly grid on a sphere for global spectral
  models based on Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature</title>
    <summary>  A new grid system on a sphere is proposed that allows for straight-forward
implementation of both spherical-harmonics-based spectral methods and
gridpoint-based multigrid methods. The latitudinal gridpoints in the new grid
are equidistant and spectral transforms in the latitudinal direction are
performed using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. The spectral transforms with this
new grid and quadrature are shown to be exact within the machine precision
provided that the grid truncation is such that there are at least 2N + 1
latitudinal gridpoints for the total truncation wavenumber of N. The new grid
and quadrature is implemented and tested on a shallow-water equations model and
the hydrostatic dry dynamical core of the global NWP model JMA-GSM. The
integration results obtained with the new quadrature are shown to be almost
identical to those obtained with the conventional Gaussian quadrature on
Gaussian grid.

    <title>Strictly proper kernel scores and characteristic kernels on compact
  spaces</title>
    <summary>  Strictly proper kernel scores are well-known tool in probabilistic
forecasting, while characteristic kernels have been extensively investigated in
the machine learning literature. We first show that both notions coincide, so
that insights from one part of the literature can be used in the other. We then
show that the metric induced by a characteristic kernel cannot reliably
distinguish between distributions that are far apart in the total variation
norm as soon as the underlying space of measures is infinite dimensional. In
addition, we provide a characterization of characteristic kernels in terms of
eigenvalues and -functions and apply this characterization to the case of
continuous kernels on (locally) compact spaces. In the compact case we further
show that characteristic kernels exist if and only if the space is metrizable.
As special cases of our general theory we investigate translation-invariant
kernels on compact Abelian groups and isotropic kernels on spheres. The latter
are of particular interest for forecast evaluation of probabilistic predictions
on spherical domains as frequently encountered in meteorology and climatology.

    <title>Data-driven forecasting of solar irradiance</title>
    <summary>  This paper describes a flexible approach to short term prediction of
meteorological variables. In particular, we focus on the prediction of the
solar irradiance one hour ahead, a task that has high practical value when
optimizing solar energy resources. As D\'efi EGC 2018 provides us with time
series data for multiple sensors (e.g. solar irradiance, temperature,
hygrometry), recorded every minute for two years and 5 geographical sites from
La R\'eunion island, we test the value of using recently observed data as input
for prediction models, as well as the performance of models across sites. After
describing our data cleaning and normalization process, we combine a variable
selection step based on AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
models, to using general purpose regression techniques such as neural networks
and regression trees.

    <title>Diffusion in translucent media</title>
    <summary>  Diffusion is the result of repeated random scattering. It governs a wide
range of phenomena from Brownian motion, to heat flow through window panes,
neutron flux in fuel rods, dispersion of light in human tissue, and electronic
conduction. It is universally acknowledged that the diffusion approach fails in
translucent samples thinner than the distance between scattering events such as
are encountered in meteorology, astronomy, biomedicine and communications. Here
we show in optical measurements and numerical simulations that the scaling of
transmission and the intensity profiles of transmission eigenchannels have the
same form in translucent as in opaque media. Paradoxically, the robustness of
the diffusive character of steady-state transport explains puzzling
observations of suppressed optical and ultrasonic delay times relative to
predictions of diffusion theory well into the diffusive regime.

    <title>Partial Distance Correlation Screening for High Dimensional Time Series</title>
    <summary>  High dimensional time series datasets are becoming increasingly common in
various fields such as economics, finance, meteorology, and neuroscience. Given
this ubiquity of time series data, it is surprising that very few works on
variable screening are directly applicable to time series data, and even fewer
methods developed which utilize the unique aspects of time series data. This
paper introduces several model free screening methods developed specifically to
deal with dependent and/or heavy tailed response and covariate time series.
These methods are based on the distance correlation and the partial distance
correlation. Methods are developed both for univariate response models, such as
non linear autoregressive models with exogenous predictors, and multivariate
response models such as linear or nonlinear VAR models. Sure screening
properties are proved for our methods, which depend on the moment conditions,
and the strength of dependence in the response and covariate processes, amongst
other factors. Dependence is quantified by functional dependence measures (Wu
[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 14150-14154]), and $\beta$-mixing
coefficients, and the results rely on the use of Nagaev and Rosenthal type
inequalities for dependent random variables. Finite sample performance of our
methods is shown through extensive simulation studies, and we include an
application to macroeconomic forecasting.

    <title>Bayesian regional food frequency analysis for large catchments</title>
    <summary>  Regional flood frequency analysis is commonly applied in situations where
there exists insufficient data at a location for a reliable estimation of flood
quantiles. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for a regional
analysis of data from 203 large catchments in Norway with the generalized
extreme value (GEV) distribution as the underlying model. Generalized linear
models on the parameters of the GEV distribution are able to incorporate
location-specific geographic and meteorological information and thereby
accommodate these effects on the flood quantiles. A Bayesian model averaging
component additionally assesses model uncertainty in the effect of the proposed
covariates. The resulting regional model is seen to give substantially better
predictive performance than the regional model currently used in Norway.

    <title>Continuum Power Spectrum Components in X-Ray Sources: Detailed Modelling
  and Search for Coherent Periodicities</title>
    <summary>  This paper summarises two recently developed techniques in power spectral
analysis and their application to a sample of X-ray light curves of accreting
collapsed objects in active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. The first
technique is designed to carry out detailed model fitting of continuum power
spectrum components arising from noise variability by using maximum likelihood
methods. The technique is applied to the light curves of a number of highly
variable AGNs observed with EXOSAT. Substantially steeper logarithmic power
spectrum slopes are obtained than previously estimated with standard methods.
The second technique was devised in order to reveal coherent periodicities in
the presence of ``coloured" (i.e. non--white) noise variability components from
the source. To this aim the power spectra are searched for significant narrow
peaks superposed on the ``coloured" continuum components. We present the
results of a search for an orbital modulation in the light curves of a sample
of 25 low mass X--ray binaries (LMXRBs), for which the orbital period is either
unknown or detected only at optical wavelengths. This led to the discovery of a
significant X--ray orbital modulation at the few percent level in the burster
MXB1636-539.

    <title>Millimetric Astronomy from the High Antarctic Plateau: site testing at
  Dome C</title>
    <summary>  Preliminary site testing at Dome C (Antarctica) is presented, using both
Automatic Weather Station (AWS) meteorological data (1986-1993) and
Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) measurements made by the authors. A comparison
with South Pole and other sites is made. The South Pole is a well established
astrophysical observing site, where extremely good conditions are reported for
a large fraction of time during the year. Dome C, where Italy and France are
building a new scientific station, is a potential observing site in the
millimetric and sub-millimetric range. AWS are operating at both sites and they
have been continuously monitoring temperature, pressure, wind speed and
direction for more than ten years. Site testing instruments are already
operating at the South Pole (AASTO, Automated Astrophysical Site-Testing
Observatory), while ''light'' experiments have been running at Dome C (APACHE,
Antarctic Plateau Anisotropy CHasing Experiment) during summertime. A direct
comparison between the two sites is planned in the near future, using the
AASTO. The present analysis shows that the average wind speed is lower at Dome
C (~1 m/s) than at the South Pole (~2 m/s), while temperature and PWV are
comparable.

    <title>Spectroscopy of the candidate luminous blue variable at the center of
  the ring nebula G79.29+0.46</title>
    <summary>  We report optical and near-infrared spectra of the central star of the radio
source G79.29+0.46, a candidate luminous blue variable. The spectra contain
numerous narrow (FWHM &lt; 100 km/s emission lines of which the low-lying hydrogen
lines are the strongest, and resemble spectra of other LBVc's and B[e]
supergiants. A few prominent infrared lines are unidentified. The terminal wind
speed is determined from H alpha to be 110 km/s. The strength of H alpha
implies the presence of a very dense wind. Extended emission from H alpha and
[N II] was detected but appears to be associated with the Cygnus X region
rather than the radio source. Both diffuse interstellar bands and interstellar
absorption lines are present in the optical spectrum of the central star,
suggesting that there are both diffuse and molecular cloud components to the
extinction and implying a minimum distance of 1 kpc and minimum luminosity of
\~10^5 L(sun) for the star. The new spectra and their analysis indicate a low
excitation, dense, and slowly expanding wind and support the LBVc
classification.

    <title>Variability Modes of Blazars from Intensive Optical Monitoring</title>
    <summary>  We report the main results of our six year long intensive optical monitoring
on blazars ON 231 (W Com), BL Lac, and 3C 273. Intensive optical monitoring is
an indispensable tool to obtain well sampled light curves and thus to
understand the correlation with the variability in other bands and to
discriminate among the proposed emission models. The curves based on our work
show different variability modes: intermittent mode, quasi-regular mode and
mixed mode. It is not clear if different variability modes can be present, at
various times, in the life of an object suggesting that their occurrence can be
related to the evolution of blazars. An optimized and nearly continuous optical
monitoring is the only way to know the activity status of the sources and to
retrieve useful information on their physical dynamics. Also, the rapid
availability of information about the luminosity of a source is very important
to trigger space based observations and to activate large multifrequency
collaborations. We stress that a significant sample of blazars can be observed
with small size telescopes (0.35-0.80 cm) equipped with CCD cameras. A
world-wide network of several instruments in different countries, is very
useful to increase the time coverage and to reduce the number of nights lost
for bad meteorological conditions.

    <title>Photometric Variability in the Ultracool Dwarf BRI 0021-0214: Possible
  Evidence for Dust Clouds</title>
    <summary>  We report CCD photometric monitoring of the nonemission ultracool dwarf BRI
0021-0214 (M9.5) obtained during 10 nights in 1995 November and 4 nights in
1996 August, with CCD cameras at 1 m class telescopes on the observatories of
the Canary Islands. We present differential photometry of BRI 0021-0214, and we
report significant variability in the I-band light curve obtained in 1995. A
periodogram analysis finds a strong peak at a period of 0.84 day. This
modulation appears to be transient because it is present in the 1995 data but
not in the 1996 data. We also find a possible period of 0.20 day, which appears
to be present in both the 1995 and 1996 datasets. However, we do not find any
periodicity close to the rotation period expected from the spectroscopic
rotational broadening (&lt; 0.14 day). BRI 0021-0214 is a very inactive object,
with extremely low levels of Halpha and X-ray emission. Thus, it is unlikely
that magnetically induced cool spots can account for the photometric
variability. The photometric variability of BRI 0021-0214 could be explained by
the presence of an active meteorology that leads to inhomogeneous clouds on the
surface. The lack of photometric modulation at the expected rotational period
suggests that the pattern of surface features may be more complicated than
previously anticipated.

    <title>Characterization of extrasolar terrestrial planets from diurnal
  photometric variability</title>
    <summary>  The detection of massive planets orbiting nearby stars has become almost
routine, but current techniques are as yet unable to detect terrestrial planets
with masses comparable to the Earth's. Future space-based observatories to
detect Earth-like planets are being planned. Terrestrial planets orbiting in
the habitable zones of stars-where planetary surface conditions are compatible
with the presence of liquid water-are of enormous interest because they might
have global environments similar to Earth's and even harbor life. The light
scattered by such a planet will vary in intensity and colour as the planet
rotates; the resulting light curve will contain information about the planet's
properties. Here we report a model that predicts features that should be
discernible in light curves obtained by low-precision photometry. For
extrasolar planets similar to Earth we expect daily flux variations up to
hundreds of percent, depending sensitively on ice and cloud cover. Qualitative
changes in surface or climate generate significant changes in the predicted
light curves. This work suggests that the meteorological variability and the
rotation period of an Earth-like planet could be derived from photometric
observations. Other properties such as the composition of the surface (e.g.,
ocean versus land fraction), climate indicators (for example ice and cloud
cover), and perhaps even signatures of Earth-like plant life could be
constrained or possibly, with further study, even uniquely determined.

    <title>Orbital periods of twenty two subdwarf B stars</title>
    <summary>  Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are thought to be core helium burning stars with low
mass hydrogen envelopes. In recent years it has become clear that many sdB
stars lose their hydrogen through interaction with a binary companion and
continue to reside in binary systems today. In this paper we present the
results of a programme to measure orbital parameters of binary sdB stars. We
determine the orbits of 22 binary sdB stars from 424 radial velocity
measurements, raising the sample of sdBs with known orbital parameters to 38.
We calculate lower limits for the masses of the companions of the sdB stars
which, when combined with the orbital periods of the systems, allow us to
discuss approximate evolutionary constraints. We find that a formation path for
sdB stars consisting of mass transfer at the tip of the red giant branch
followed by a common envelope phase explains most, but not all of the observed
systems. It is particularly difficult to explain both long period systems and
short period, massive systems. We present new measurements of the effective
temperature, surface density and surface helium abundance for some of the sdB
stars by fitting their blue spectra. We find that two of them (PG0839+399 and
KPD1946+4340) do not lie in the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB) band indicating
that they are post-EHB stars.

    <title>A Model of the Temporal Variability of Optical Light from Extrasolar
  Terrestrial Planets</title>
    <summary>  The light scattered by an extrasolar Earth-like planet's surface and
atmosphere will vary in intensity and color as the planet rotates; the
resulting light curve will contain information about the planet's properties.
Since most of the light comes from a small fraction of the planet's surface,
the temporal flux variability can be quite significant, $\sim$ 10-100%. In
addition, for cloudless Earth-like extrasolar planet models, qualitative
changes to the surface (such as ocean fraction, ice cover) significantly affect
the light curve. Clouds dominate the temporal variability of the Earth but can
be coherent over several days. In contrast to Earth's temporal variability, a
uniformly, heavily clouded planet (e.g. Venus), would show almost no flux
variability. We present light curves for an unresolved Earth and for Earth-like
model planets calculated by changing the surface features. This work suggests
that meteorological variability and the rotation period of an Earth-like planet
could be derived from photometric observations. The inverse problem of deriving
surface properties from a given light curve is complex and will require much
more investigation.

    <title>New results on GP Com</title>
    <summary>  We present high resolution optical and UV spectra of the 46 min orbital
period, helium binary, GP Com. Our data contains simultaneous photometric
correction which confirms the flaring behaviour observed in previous optical
and UV data. In this system all lines show a triple peaked structure where the
outer two peaks are associated with the accretion disc around the compact
object. The main aim of this paper is to constrain the origin of the central
peak, also called ``central spike''. We find that the central spike contributes
to the flare spectra indicating that its origin is probably the compact object.
We also detect that the central spike moves with orbital phase following an
S-wave pattern. The radial velocity semiamplitude of the S-wave is ~10 km/s
indicating that its origin is near the centre of mass of the system, which in
this case lies very close to the white dwarf. Our resolution is higher than
that of previous data which allows us to resolve structure in the central peak
of the line. The central spike in three of the HeI lines shows another peak
blueshifted with respect to the main peak. We propose that one of the peaks is
a neutral helium forbidden transition excited in a high electron density
region. This forbidden transition is associated with the permitted one (the
stronger peak in two of the lines). The presence of a high electron density
region again favours the white dwarf as their origin.

    <title>Tidal interactions of close-in extrasolar planets: the OGLE cases</title>
    <summary>  Close-in extrasolar planets experience extreme tidal interactions with their
host stars. This may lead to a reduction of the planetary orbit and a spin-up
of stellar rotation. Tidal interactions have been computed for a number of
extrasolar planets in circular orbits within 0.06 AU, namely for OGLE-TR-56 b.
We compare our range of the tidal dissipation value with two dissipation models
from Sasselov (2003) and conclude that our choices are equivalent to these
models. However, applied to the planet OGLE-TR-56 b, we find in contrast to
Sasselov (2003) that this planet will spiral-in toward the host star in a few
billion years. We show that the average and maximum value of our range of
dissipation are equivalent to the linear and quadratic dissipation models of
Sasselov (2003). Due to limitations in the observational techniques, we do not
see a possibility to distinguish between the two dissipation models as outlined
by Sasselov (2003). OGLE-TR-56 b may therefore not serve as a test case for
dissipation models. The probable existence of OGLE-TR-3 b at 0.02 AU and the
discovery of OGLE-TR-113 b at 0.023 AU and OGLE-TR-132 b at 0.03 AU may also
counter Sasselovs (2003) assumption of a pile-up stopping boundary at 0.04 AU.

    <title>El Roque de Los Muchachos site characteristics, I.Temperature analysis</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we present an analysis of temperature taken at two telescopes
located at the Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos in the Canary Islands.
More than 20 years of measurements at CAMC are included. The analysis of the
data from TNG and CAMC are compared in order to check local variations and long
term trends. Furthermore, the temperatures at different heights are correlated
to the quality of astronomical seeing. We considered the correlation of NAO
Index and annual downtime with mean annual temperatures. The final aim of this
work is to better understand the influence of wide scale parameters on local
meteorological data. The analysis is done using a statistical approach. From
each long series of data we compute the hourly averages and than the monthly
averages in order to reduce the short time fluctuations due to the day/night
cycle. A particular care is used to minimize any effect due to biases in case
of lacking of data. Finally, we compute the annual average from the monthly
ones. The two telescopes show similar trends. There is an increase of
temperatures of about 1.0 deg/10yrs from the annual means and a more rapid
increase of the annual minimums then the maximums. We found that positive NAO
Index reduces the increase of temperatures, and accelerates the decrease.
Moreover, there is no evidence that positive NAO Index corresponds to a lower
number of non-observable nights. Finally, seeing deteriorates when the gradient
of temperatures between 2 and 10 m above the ground is greater than -0.6 deg.

    <title>Fast Ensemble Smoothing</title>
    <summary>  Smoothing is essential to many oceanographic, meteorological and hydrological
applications. The interval smoothing problem updates all desired states within
a time interval using all available observations. The fixed-lag smoothing
problem updates only a fixed number of states prior to the observation at
current time. The fixed-lag smoothing problem is, in general, thought to be
computationally faster than a fixed-interval smoother, and can be an
appropriate approximation for long interval-smoothing problems. In this paper,
we use an ensemble-based approach to fixed-interval and fixed-lag smoothing,
and synthesize two algorithms. The first algorithm produces a linear time
solution to the interval smoothing problem with a fixed factor, and the second
one produces a fixed-lag solution that is independent of the lag length.
Identical-twin experiments conducted with the Lorenz-95 model show that for lag
lengths approximately equal to the error doubling time, or for long intervals
the proposed methods can provide significant computational savings. These
results suggest that ensemble methods yield both fixed-interval and fixed-lag
smoothing solutions that cost little additional effort over filtering and model
propagation, in the sense that in practical ensemble application the additional
increment is a small fraction of either filtering or model propagation costs.
We also show that fixed-interval smoothing can perform as fast as fixed-lag
smoothing and may be advantageous when memory is not an issue.

    <title>Energy Conservation and Second-Order Statistics in Stably Stratified
  Turbulent Boundary Layers</title>
    <summary>  We address the dynamical and statistical description of stably stratified
turbulent boundary layers with the important example of the atmospheric
boundary layer with a stable temperature stratification in mind. Traditional
approaches to this problem, based on the profiles of mean quantities, velocity
second-order correlations, and dimensional estimates of the turbulent thermal
flux run into a well known difficulty, predicting the suppression of turbulence
at a small critical value of the Richardson number, in contradiction with
observations. Phenomenological attempts to overcome this problem suffer from
various theoretical inconsistencies. Here we present an approach taking into
full account all the second-order statistics, which allows us to respect the
conservation of total mechanical energy. The analysis culminates in an analytic
solution of the profiles of all mean quantities and all second-order
correlations removing the unphysical predictions of previous theories. We
propose that the approach taken here is sufficient to describe the lower parts
of the atmospheric boundary layer, as long as the Richardson number does not
exceed an order of unity. For much higher Richardson numbers the physics may
change qualitatively, requiring careful consideration of the potential
Kelvin-Helmoholtz waves and their interaction with the vortical turbulence.

    <title>11-Year Warm Cloud Modification Experiment in Maharashtra State, India</title>
    <summary>  A warm cloud modification experiment was carried out in an area of 4800 Sq.Km
in the Pune region,India, during the 11-summer monsoon (June-September) seasons
(1973-74, 1976, 1979-86). A double-area cross-over design with area
randomization was adopted and an instrumented aircraft was used for seeding and
cloud physical measurements. Finely pulverised salt (sodium chloride) particles
were released into the monsoon clouds (cumulus and stratocumulus) during
aircraft penetrations into the clouds at a height of 200-300 m above the
cloud-base. The warm cloud responses to salt seeding are found to be critically
dependent on the cloud physical characteristics e.g., vertical thickness and
liquid water content. Clouds with vertical thickness greater than 1 km, LWC
greater than 0.5 gm/cubic m when seeded with salt particles (modal diameter 10
micro m, concentration 1 per litre of cloud air) produced increase in rainfall
of 24 per cent significant at 4 per cent level. Shallow clouds (vertical
thickness less than 1 km, LWC less than 0.5 gm/cubic m) when seeded showed
tendency for dissipation. The cloud physical observations made in not-seeded
(control) and seeded (target) clouds have provided some useful evidence to test
the applicability of the warm cloud modification hypothesis. The results of the
cloud model computations suggested that moderate convergence at the cloud-base
is essential for the cloud growth and development of precipitation in the real
world. Hygroscopic particle seeding of warm clouds under favourable dynamical
conditions (convergence at the cloud-base level) may result in the acceleration
of the collision-coalescence process resulting in the enhancement of rainfall.

    <title>Universal Spectrum for Natural Variability of Climate: Implications for
  Climate Change</title>
    <summary>  The apparantly irregular (unpredictable) space-time fluctuations in
atmospheric flows ranging from climate (thousands of kilometers - years) to
turbulence (millimeters - seconds) exhibit the universal symmetry of
self-similarity. Self-similarity or scale invariance implies long-range
spatiotemporal correlations and is manifested in atmospheric flows as the
fractal geometry to spatial pattern concomitant with inverse power-law form for
power spectra of temporal fluctuations. Long-range spatiotemporal correlations
are ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature and are identified as signatures
of self-organized criticality. Standard meteorological theory cannot explain
satisfactorily the observed self-organized criticality. Numerical models for
simulation and prediction of atmospheric flows are subject to deterministic
chaos and give unrealistic solutions. Deterministic chaos is a direct
consequence of round-off error growth in iterative computations. Round-off
error of finite precision computations doubles on an average at each step of
iterative computations. Round-off error will propagate to the mainstream
computation and give unrealistic solutions in numerical weather prediction
(NWP) and climate models which incorporate thousands of iterative computations
in long-term numerical integration schemes. A recently developed
non-deterministic cell dynamical system model for atmospheric flows predicts
the observed self-organized criticality as intrinsic to quantumlike mechanics
governing flow dynamics.

    <title>The Dynamics of Deterministic Chaos in Numerical Weather Prediction
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric weather systems are coherent structures consisting of discrete
cloud cells forming patterns of rows/streets, mesoscale clusters and spiral
bands which maintain their identity for the duration of their appreciable life
times in the turbulent shear flow of the planetary Atmospheric Boundary Layer.
The existence of coherent structures (seemingly systematic motion) in turbulent
flows has been well established during the last 20 years of research in
turbulence. Numerical weather prediction models based on the inherently
non-linear Navier-Stokes equations do not give realistic forecasts because of
the following inherent limitations: (1) the non-linear governing equations for
atmospheric flows do not have exact analytic solutions and being sensitive to
initial conditions give chaotic solutions characteristic of deterministic chaos
(2) the governing equations do not incorporate the dynamical interactions and
co-existence of the complete spectrum of turbulent fluctuations which form an
integral part of the large coherent weather systems (3) limitations of
available computer capacity necessitates severe truncation of the governing
equations, thereby generating errors of approximations (4) the computer
precision related roundoff errors magnify the earlier mentioned uncertainties
exponentially with time and the model predictions become unrealistic. The
accurate modelling of weather phenomena therefore requires alternative concepts
and computational techniques. In this paper a universal theory of deterministic
chaos applicable to the formation of coherent weather structures in the ABL is
presented.

    <title>Instrumentation for atmospheric ion measurements</title>
    <summary>  Small ions are part of the atmospheric aerosol spectrum, and study of
ion-aerosol interactions is fundamental in atmospheric physics. Air ion physics
and instrumentation are reviewed, including the historical context. A
miniaturised Gerdien condenser for ion measurement, operating in situ to
minimise inlet errors, is described. Two operating modes using independent
current and voltage decay measurements are employed. A more sophisticated
self-calibrating and fully programmable ion mobility spectrometer (PIMS) based
on the same principles, is also discussed. Detailed analysis of error terms and
application of new technology is demonstrated to greatly improve its
capability. Self-consistent experimental approaches, including ionisation and
ion concentration instruments, are used for calibration. In developing and
characterising the individual components of the PIMS, favourable and
unfavourable operating regimes are identified: this approach can also be
applied to other aspiration ion counting techniques. Use of a sophisticated
programmable electrometer permits compensation for leakage terms.
Electrically-charged aerosol particles have been found to complicate the ion
measurements. Consequently, conventional ion-aerosol theory, which neglects the
particulate concentration, is thought to be incomplete. The polymodal ion
mobility spectrum is also found to influence the instrument's operation.
Development of the novel programmable ion instrumentation, in conjunction with
consideration of the ion mobility spectrum yields an improved and flexible
approach to in situ atmospheric ion measurements.

    <title>Pattern Informatics and Its Application for Optimal Forecasting of Large
  Earthquakes in Japan</title>
    <summary>  Pattern informatics (PI) technique can be used to detect precursory seismic
activation or quiescence and make earthquake forecast. Here we apply the PI
method for optimal forecasting of large earthquakes in Japan, using the data
catalogue maintained by the Japan Meteorological Agency. The PI method is
tested to forecast large (magnitude m &gt;= 5) earthquakes for the time period
1995-2004 in the Kobe region. Visual inspection and statistical testing show
that the optimized PI method has forecasting skill, relative to the seismic
intensity data often used as a standard null hypothesis. Moreover, we find a
retrospective forecast that the 1995 Kobe earthquake (m = 7.2) falls in a
seismically anomalous area. Another approach to test the forecasting algorithm
is to create a future potential map for large (m &gt;= 5) earthquake events. This
is illustrated using the Kobe and Tokyo regions for the forecast period
2000-2009. Based on the resulting Kobe map we point out several forecasted
areas: the epicentral area of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the Wakayama area, the
Mie area, and the Aichi area. The Tokyo forecasted map was created prior to the
occurrence of the Oct. 23, 2004 Niigata earthquake (m = 6.8) and the principal
aftershocks with m &gt;= 5.0. We find that these events occurred in a forecasted
area in the Tokyo map. The PI technique for regional seismicity observation
substantiates an example showing considerable promise as an intermediate-term
earthquake forecasting in Japan.

    <title>Numerical Methods as an Integrated Part of Physics Education</title>
    <summary>  During the last decade we have witnessed an impressive development in
so-called interpreted languages and computational environments such as Maple,
Mathematica, IDL, Matlab etc. Problems which until recently were typically
solved on mainframe machines and written in computing languages such as Fortran
or C/C++, can now easily be solved on standard PCs with the bonus of immediate
visualizations of the results.
  In our undergraduate programs an often posed question is how to incorporate
and exploit efficiently these advances in the standard physics and mathematics
curriculum, without detracting the attention from the classical and basic
theoretical and experimental topics to be covered. Furthermore, if students are
trained to use such tools at early stages in their education, do such tools
really enhance and improve the learning environment? And, perhaps even more
important, does it lead to a better physics understanding?
  Here we present one possible approach, where computational topics are
gradually baked into our undergraduate curriculum in Mathematics and Physics,
Astronomy and Meteorology. We focus on training our students to use general
programming tools in solving physics problems, in addition to the classical
analytic problems. By this approach, the students gain an expertise that they
can build upon in their future studies and careers. We use mainly Java, Matlab
and Maple as computational environments. Our students are now capable of
handling at an early stage in their education more realistic physics problems
than before. We believe firmly that, in addition to educating modern
scientists, this promotes a better physics understanding for a majority of the
students.

    <title>Atmospheric electrification in the Solar System</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric electrification is not a purely terrestrial phenomenon: all Solar
System planetary atmospheres become slightly electrified by cosmic ray
ionisation. There is evidence for lightning on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune, and it appears likely to exist on Mars, Venus and Titan. Atmospheric
electricity has controversially been implicated in climate on Earth; here, a
comparative approach is employed to review the role of electrification in the
atmospheres of other planets and their moons. This paper reviews planetary
atmospheric electricity including ionisation and ion-aerosol interactions. The
conditions necessary for a global electric circuit, and the likelihood of
meeting these conditions in other planetary atmospheres are briefly discussed.
Atmospheric electrification could be important throughout the Solar System,
particularly at the outer planets which receive little solar radiation,
increasing the significance of electrical forces. Nucleation onto atmospheric
ions has been predicted to affect the evolution and lifetime of haze layers on
Titan, Neptune, and Triton. Atmospheric electrical processes on Titan,
pre-Huygens, are summarised. Closer to Earth, heating from solar radiation
dominates planetary meteorology; however Mars may have a global circuit based
on electrical discharges from dust storms. There is a need for direct
measurements of planetary atmospheric electrification, in particular on Mars,
to assess the risk for future missions. Theoretical understanding could be
increased by cross-disciplinary work to modify and update models and
parameterisations initially developed for specific planetary atmospheres to
make them more broadly applicable.

    <title>The global atmospheric electrical circuit and climate</title>
    <summary>  Evidence is emerging for physical links among clouds, global temperatures,
the global atmospheric electrical circuit and cosmic ray ionisation. The global
circuit extends throughout the atmosphere from the planetary surface to the
lower layers of the ionosphere. Cosmic rays are the principal source of
atmospheric ions away from the continental boundary layer: the ions formed
permit a vertical conduction current to flow in the fair weather part of the
global circuit. Through the (inverse) solar modulation of cosmic rays, the
resulting columnar ionisation changes may allow the global circuit to convey a
solar influence to meteorological phenomena of the lower atmosphere. Electrical
effects on non-thunderstorm clouds have been proposed to occur via the
ion-assisted formation of ultrafine aerosol, which can grow to sizes able to
act as cloud condensation nuclei, or through the increased ice nucleation
capability of charged aerosols. Even small atmospheric electrical modulations
on the aerosol size distribution can affect cloud properties and modify the
radiative balance of the atmosphere, through changes communicated globally by
the atmospheric electrical circuit. Despite a long history of work in related
areas of geophysics, the direct and inverse relationships between the global
circuit and global climate remain largely quantitatively unexplored. From
reviewing atmospheric electrical measurements made over two centuries and
possible paleoclimate proxies, global atmospheric electrical circuit
variability should be expected on many timescales

    <title>A Cell Dynamical System Model for Simulation of Continuum Dynamics of
  Turbulent Fluid Flows</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric flows exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations manifested
as the fractal geometry to the global cloud cover pattern concomitant with
inverse power-law form for power spectra of temporal fluctuations of all scales
ranging from turbulence (millimeters-seconds) to climate (thousands of
kilometers-years). Long-range spatiotemporal correlations are ubiquitous to
dynamical systems in nature and are identified as signatures of self-organized
criticality. Standard models for turbulent fluid flows in meteorological theory
cannot explain satisfactorily the observed multifractal (space-time) structures
in atmospheric flows. Numerical models for simulation and prediction of
atmospheric flows are subject to deterministic chaos and give unrealistic
solutions. Deterministic chaos is a direct consequence of round-off error
growth in iterative computations. Round-off error of finite precision
computations doubles on an average at each step of iterative computations.
Round-off error will propagate to the mainstream computation and give
unrealistic solutions in numerical weather prediction and climate models which
incorporate thousands of iterative computations in long-term numerical
integration schemes. A recently developed non-deterministic cell dynamical
system model for atmospheric flows predicts the observed self-organized
criticality as intrinsic to quantumlike mechanics governing flow dynamics.
Further, the fractal space-time structure to the stringlike atmospheric flow
trajectory is resolved into a continuum of eddies. The eddy circulations obey
Kepler third law of planetary motion and therefore eddy inertial masses obey
Newton inverse square law of gravitation on all scales from microscopic to
macroscale.

    <title>Super-Droplet Method for the Numerical Simulation of Clouds and
  Precipitation: a Particle-Based Microphysics Model Coupled with
  Non-hydrostatic Model</title>
    <summary>  A novel simulation model of cloud microphysics is developed, which is named
Super-Droplet Method (SDM). SDM enables accurate calculation of cloud
microphysics with reasonable cost in computation. A simple SDM for warm rain,
which incorporates sedimentation, condensation/evaporation, stochastic
coalescence, is developed. The methodology to couple SDM and a non-hydrostatic
model is also developed. It is confirmed that the result of our Monte Carlo
scheme for the coalescence of super-droplets agrees fairly well with the
solution of stochastic coalescence equation. A preliminary simulation of a
shallow maritime cumulus formation initiated by a warm bubble is presented to
demonstrate the practicality of SDM. Further discussions are devoted for the
extension and the computational efficiency of SDM to incorporate various
properties of clouds, such as, several types of ice crystals, several sorts of
soluble/insoluble CCNs, their chemical reactions, electrification, and the
breakup of droplets. It is suggested that the computational cost of SDM becomes
lower than spectral (bin) method when the number of attributes $d$ becomes
larger than some critical value, which may be $2\sim4$.

    <title>Radiation-cooled Dew Water Condensers Studied by Computational Fluid
  Dynamic (CFD)</title>
    <summary>  Harvesting condensed atmospheric vapour as dew water can be an alternative or
complementary potable water resource in specific arid or insular areas. Such
radiation-cooled condensing devices use already existing flat surfaces (roofs)
or innovative structures with more complex shapes to enhance the dew yield. The
Computational Fluid Dynamic - CFD - software PHOENICS has been programmed and
applied to such radiation cooled condensers. For this purpose, the sky
radiation is previously integrated and averaged for each structure. The
radiative balance is then included in the CFD simulation tool to compare the
efficiency of the different structures under various meteorological parameters,
for complex or simple shapes and at various scales. It has been used to precise
different structures before construction. (1) a 7.32 m^2 funnel shape was
studied; a 30 degree tilted angle (60 degree cone half-angle) was computed to
be the best compromise for funnel cooling. Compared to a 1 m^2 flat condenser,
the cooling efficiency was expected to be improved by 40%. Seventeen months
measurements in outdoor tests presented a 138 % increased dew yield as compared
to the 1 m^2 flat condenser. (2) The simulation results for 5 various condenser
shapes were also compared with experimental measurement on corresponding pilots
systems: 0.16 m^2 flat planar condenser, 1 m^2 and 30 degree tilted planar
condenser, 30 m^2 and 30 degree tilted planar condenser, 255 m^2 multi ridges,
a preliminary construction of a large scale dew plant being implemented in the
Kutch area (Gujarat, India).

    <title>How unusual was autumn 2006 in Europe?</title>
    <summary>  The temperatures in large parts of Europe have been record high during the
meteorological autumn of 2006. Compared to 1961-1990, the 2m temperature was
more than three degrees Celsius above normal from the North side of the Alps to
southern Norway. This made it by far the warmest autumn on record in the United
Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, with the
records in Central England going back to 1659, in the Netherlands to 1706 and
in Denmark to 1768.
  Assuming that the mean of the temperature distribution changes proportional
to the global mean temperature, but the shape remains the same includes to
first order the effects of global warming. Even under this assumption the
autumn temperatures were very unusual, with estimates of the return time of 200
to 2000 years in this region. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is
more than 100 to 300 years.
  Climate models that simulate the current atmospheric circulation well
underestimate the observed mean rise in autumn temperatures. They do not
simulate a change in the shape of the distribution that would increase the
probability of warm events under global warming. This implies that the warm
autumn 2006 either was a very rare coincidence, or the local temperature rise
is much stronger than modelled, or non-linear physics that is missing from
these models increases the probability of warm extremes.

    <title>Amélioration de l'étude de l'étude de l'humidité de sols par
  radiométrie. Caractérisation et modélisation diélectriques de profils
  géologiques</title>
    <summary>  The surface soil moisture is a key variable to describe the exchange of water
and energy between the land and the atmosphere. In hydrology, and meteorology,
the amount of water in the upper soil layers permits (0-5 cm from the surface)
the evaluation of the relationship between the real evaporation and the
potential evaporation of the bare soil. It is also possible to determine the
distribution of rainfall or other variables such as hydraulic conductivity.
Studies have shown that microwave sensors could be used to scan the surface
soil moisture. The solution choose by the team associated with the SMOS mission
(Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) is to use a radiometer (1.4 GHz) to identify
soil microwave emissions . The measurements are made on the site of CESBIO in
Toulouse where a 1.4 GHz radiometer is installed . The effect of vegetation
cover, soil temperatures, snow cover, topography or moisture variations have an
important role in the broadcast microwave surface. Other parameters such as the
presence of inclusions in the ground (holes, stones), or soil texture can also
disrupt measurements. The aim of the work that we present in this paper is to
develop a numerical model to simulate complex geological structures. This model
must take into account all parameters that can affect the equivalent
permittivity measured by the radiometer (surface, moisture variation ,...
inclusions). The purpose of this model is to calculate the equivalent
permittivity of these geological structures in order to be able to associate
with each radiometer measurement an equivalent moisture.

    <title>From a set of parts to an indivisible whole. Part I: Operations in a
  closed mode</title>
    <summary>  This paper provides a description of a new method for information processing
based on holistic approach wherein analysis is a direct product of synthesis.
The core of the method is iterative averaging of all the elements of a system
according to all the parameters describing the elements. Contrary to common
logic, the iterative averaging of a system's elements does not result in
homogenization of the system; instead, it causes an obligatory subdivision of
the system into two alternative subgroups, leaving no outliers. Within each of
the formed subgroups, similarity coefficients between the elements reach the
value of 1, whereas similarity coefficients between the elements of different
subgroups equal a certain constant value greater than 0 but lower than 1. When
subjected to iterative averaging, any system consisting of three or more
elements of which at least two elements are not completely identical undergo
such a process of bifurcation that occurs non-linearly. Successive iterative
averaging of each of the forming subgroups eventually provides a hierarchical
system that reflects relationships between the elements of an input system
under analysis. We propose a definition of a natural hierarchy that can exist
only in conditions of closeness of a system and can be discovered upon
providing such an effect onto a system which allows its elements interact with
each other based on the principle of self-organization. Self-organization can
be achieved through an overall and total cross-averaging of a system's
elements. We demonstrate the application potentials of the proposed technology
on a number of examples, including a system of scattered points, randomized
datasets, as well as meteorological and demographical datasets.

    <title>Characterization of the tail of the distribution of earthquake
  magnitudes by combining the GEV and GPD descriptions of Extreme Value Theory</title>
    <summary>  We present a generic and powerful approach to study the statistics of extreme
phenomena (meteorology, finance, biology...) that we apply to the statistical
estimation of the tail of the distribution of earthquake sizes. The chief
innovation is to combine the two main limit theorems of Extreme Value Theory
(EVT) that allow us to derive the distribution of T-maxima (maximum magnitude
occurring in sequential time intervals of duration T) for arbitrary T. We
propose a method for the estimation of the unknown parameters involved in the
two limit theorems corresponding to the Generalized Extreme Value distribution
(GEV) and to the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). We establish the direct
relations between the parameters of these distributions, which permit to
evaluate the distribution of the T-maxima for arbitrary T. The duality between
the GEV and GPD provides a new way to check the consistency of the estimation
of the tail characteristics of the distribution of earthquake magnitudes for
earthquake occurring over arbitrary time interval. We develop several
procedures and check points to decrease the scatter of the estimates and to
verify their consistency. We test our full procedure on the global Harvard
catalog (1977-2006) and on the Fennoscandia catalog (1900-2005). For the global
catalog, we obtain the following estimates: Mmax = 9.53 +- 0.52;
quantile(0.97)==9.21 +- 0.20. For Fennoscandia, we obtain Mmax = 5.76 +- 0.165;
quantile(0.97) =5.44 +- 0.073. The estimates of all related parameters for the
GEV and GPD, including the most important form parameter, are also provided.

    <title>Energy- and flux-budget turbulence closure model for stably stratified
  flows. Part II: the role of internal gravity waves</title>
    <summary>  We advance our prior energy- and flux-budget turbulence closure model
(Zilitinkevich et al., 2007, 2008) for the stably stratified atmospheric flows
and extend it accounting for additional vertical flux of momentum and
additional productions of turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent potential energy
(TPE) and turbulent flux of potential temperature due to large-scale internal
gravity waves (IGW). Main effects of IGW are following: the maximal value of
the flux Richardson number (universal constant 0.2-0.25 in the no-IGW regime)
becomes strongly variable. In the vertically homogeneous stratification, it
increases with increasing wave energy and can even exceed 1. In the
heterogeneous stratification, when IGW propagate towards stronger
stratification, the maximal flux Richardson number decreases with increasing
wave energy, reaches zero and then becomes negative. In other words, the
vertical flux of potential temperature becomes counter-gradient. IGW also
reduce anisotropy of turbulence and increase the share of TPE in the turbulent
total energy. Depending on the direction (downward or upward), IGW either
strengthen or weaken the total vertical flux of momentum. Predictions from the
proposed model are consistent with available data from atmospheric and
laboratory experiments, direct numerical simulations and large-eddy
simulations.

    <title>Three Dimensional Modeling of Hot Jupiter Atmospheric Flows</title>
    <summary>  We present a three dimensional hot Jupiter model, extending from 200 bar to 1
mbar, using the Intermediate General Circulation Model from the University of
Reading. Our horizontal spectral resolution is T31 (equivalent to a grid of
48x96), with 33 logarithmically spaced vertical levels. A simplified
(Newtonian) scheme is employed for the radiative forcing. We adopt a physical
set up nearly identical to the model of HD 209458b by Cooper &amp; Showman
(2005,2006) to facilitate a direct model inter-comparison. Our results are
broadly consistent with theirs but significant differences also emerge. The
atmospheric flow is characterized by a super-rotating equatorial jet, transonic
wind speeds, and eastward advection of heat away from the dayside. We identify
a dynamically-induced temperature inversion ("stratosphere") on the planetary
dayside and find that temperatures at the planetary limb differ systematically
from local radiative equilibrium values, a potential source of bias for transit
spectroscopic interpretations. While our model atmosphere is quasi-identical to
that of Cooper &amp; Showman (2005,2006) and we solve the same meteorological
equations, we use different algorithmic methods, spectral-implicit vs.
grid-explicit, which are known to yield fully consistent results in the Earth
modeling context. The model discrepancies identified here indicate that one or
both numerical methods do not faithfully capture all of the atmospheric
dynamics at work in the hot Jupiter context. We highlight the emergence of a
shock-like feature in our model, much like that reported recently by Showman et
al. (2009), and suggest that improved representations of energy conservation
may be needed in hot Jupiter atmospheric models, as emphasized by Goodman
(2009).

    <title>Earthquake Forecasting Based on Data Assimilation: Sequential Monte
  Carlo Methods for Renewal Processes</title>
    <summary>  In meteorology, engineering and computer sciences, data assimilation is
routinely employed as the optimal way to combine noisy observations with prior
model information for obtaining better estimates of a state, and thus better
forecasts, than can be achieved by ignoring data uncertainties. Earthquake
forecasting, too, suffers from measurement errors and partial model information
and may thus gain significantly from data assimilation. We present perhaps the
first fully implementable data assimilation method for earthquake forecasts
generated by a point-process model of seismicity. We test the method on a
synthetic and pedagogical example of a renewal process observed in noise, which
is relevant to the seismic gap hypothesis, models of characteristic earthquakes
and to recurrence statistics of large quakes inferred from paleoseismic data
records. To address the non-Gaussian statistics of earthquakes, we use
sequential Monte Carlo methods, a set of flexible simulation-based methods for
recursively estimating arbitrary posterior distributions. We perform extensive
numerical simulations to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of
forecasting earthquakes based on data assimilation. In particular, we show that
the forecasts based on the Optimal Sampling Importance Resampling (OSIR)
particle filter are significantly better than those of a benchmark forecast
that ignores uncertainties in the observed event times. We use the marginal
data likelihood, a measure of the explanatory power of a model in the presence
of data errors, to estimate parameters and compare models.

    <title>A General Systems Theory for Atmospheric Flows and Atmospheric Aerosol
  Size Distribution</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric flows exhibit selfsimilar fractal spacetime fluctuations
manifested as the fractal geometry to global cloud cover pattern and inverse
power law form for power spectra of meteorological parameters such as
windspeed, temperature, rainfall etc. Inverse power law form for power spectra
indicate long-range spacetime correlations or non-local connections and is a
signature of selforganised criticality generic to dynamical systems in nature
such as river flows, population dynamics, heart beat patterns etc. The author
has developed a general systems theory which predicts the observed
selforganised criticality as a signature of quantumlike chaos in dynamical
systems. The model predictions are (i) The fractal fluctuations can be resolved
into an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory with the quasiperiodic Penrose
tiling pattern for the internal structure. (ii) The probability distribution
represents the power (variance) spectrum for fractal fluctuations and follows
universal inverse power law form incorporating the golden mean. Such a result
that the additive amplitudes of eddies when squared represent probability
distribution is observed in the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems such as
the electron or photon. Therefore the irregular or unpredictable fractal
fluctuations exhibit quantumlike chaos. (iii) Atmospheric aerosols are held in
suspension by the vertical velocity distribution (spectrum). The atmospheric
aerosol size spectrum is derived in terms of the universal inverse power law
characterizing atmospheric eddy energy spectrum. Model predicted spectrum is in
agreement with the following two experimentally determined atmospheric aerosol
data sets, (i) SAFARI 2000 CV-580 Aerosol Data, Dry Season 2000 (CARG) (ii)
World Data Centre Aerosols data sets for the three stations Ny {\AA}lesund,
Pallas and Hohenpeissenberg.

    <title>Nonparametric "regression" when errors are positioned at end-points</title>
    <summary>  Increasing practical interest has been shown in regression problems where the
errors, or disturbances, are centred in a way that reflects particular
characteristics of the mechanism that generated the data. In economics this
occurs in problems involving data on markets, productivity and auctions, where
it can be natural to centre at an end-point of the error distribution rather
than at the distribution's mean. Often these cases have an extreme-value
character, and in that broader context, examples involving meteorological,
record-value and production-frontier data have been discussed in the
literature. We shall discuss nonparametric methods for estimating regression
curves in these settings, showing that they have features that contrast so
starkly with those in better understood problems that they lead to apparent
contradictions. For example, merely by centring errors at their end-points
rather than their means the problem can change from one with a familiar
nonparametric character, where the optimal convergence rate is slower than
$n^{-1/2}$, to one in the super-efficient class, where the optimal rate is
faster than $n^{-1/2}$. Moreover, when the errors are centred in a non-standard
way there is greater intrinsic interest in estimating characteristics of the
error distribution, as well as of the regression mean itself. The paper will
also address this aspect of the problem.

    <title>Supermagnetosonic jets behind a collisionless quasi-parallel shock</title>
    <summary>  The downstream region of a collisionless quasi-parallel shock is structured
containing bulk flows with high kinetic energy density from a previously
unidentified source. We present Cluster multi-spacecraft measurements of this
type of supermagnetosonic jet as well as of a weak secondary shock front within
the sheath, that allow us to propose the following generation mechanism for the
jets: The local curvature variations inherent to quasi-parallel shocks can
create fast, deflected jets accompanied by density variations in the downstream
region. If the speed of the jet is super(magneto)sonic in the reference frame
of the obstacle, a second shock front forms in the sheath closer to the
obstacle. Our results can be applied to collisionless quasi-parallel shocks in
many plasma environments.

    <title>Joint PDF modelling of turbulent flow and dispersion in an urban street

    <summary>  The joint probability density function (PDF) of turbulent velocity and
concentration of a passive scalar in an urban street canyon is computed using a
newly developed particle-in-cell Monte Carlo method. Compared to moment
closures, the PDF methodology provides the full one-point one-time PDF of the
underlying fields containing all higher moments and correlations. The
small-scale mixing of the scalar released from a concentrated source at the
street level is modelled by the interaction by exchange with the conditional
mean (IECM) model, with a micro-mixing time scale designed for geometrically
complex settings. The boundary layer along no-slip walls (building sides and
tops) is fully resolved using an elliptic relaxation technique, which captures
the high anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the Reynolds stress tensor in these
regions. A less computationally intensive technique based on wall functions to
represent boundary layers and its effect on the solution are also explored. The
calculated statistics are compared to experimental data and large-eddy
simulation. The present work can be considered as the first example of
computation of the full joint PDF of velocity and a transported passive scalar
in an urban setting. The methodology proves successful in providing high level
statistical information on the turbulence and pollutant concentration fields in
complex urban scenarios.

    <title>A Proof, Based on the Euler Sum Acceleration, of the Recovery of an
  Exponential (Geometric) Rate of Convergence for the Fourier Series of a
  Function with Gibbs Phenomenon</title>
    <summary>  When a function $f(x)$ is singular at a point $x_{s}$ on the real axis, its
Fourier series, when truncated at the $N$-th term, gives a pointwise error of
only $O(1/N)$ over the entire real axis. Such singularities spontaneously arise
as "fronts" in meteorology and oceanography and "shocks" in other branches of
fluid mechanics. It has been previously shown that it is possible to recover an
exponential rate of convegence at all points away from the singularity in the
sense that $|f(x) - f_{N}^{\sigma}(x) | \sim O(\exp(- q(x) N))$ where
$f_{N}^{\sigma}(x)$ is the result of applying a filter or summability method to
the partial sum $f_{N}(x)$ and $q(x)$ is a proportionality constant that is a
function of $d(x) \equiv |x-x_{s}|$, the distance from $x$ to the singularity.
Here we give an elementary proof of great generality using conformal mapping in
a dummy variable $z$; this is equivalent to applying the Euler acceleration. We
show that $q(x) \approx \log(\cos(d(x)/2))$ for the Euler filter when the
Fourier period is $2 \pi$. More sophisticated filters can increase $q(x)$, but
the Euler filter is simplest. We can also correct recently published claims
that only a root-exponential rate of convergence can be recovered for filters
of compact support such as the Euler acceleration and the Erfc-Log filter.

    <title>Universal Spectrum for Atmospheric Suspended Particulates: Comparison
  with Observations</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric flows exhibit self-similar fractal space-time fluctuations on all
space-time scales in association with inverse power law distribution for power
spectra of meteorological parameters such as wind, temperature, etc., and thus
implies long-range correlations, identified as self-organized criticality
generic to dynamical systems in nature. A general systems theory based on
classical statistical physical concepts developed by the author visualizes the
fractal fluctuations to result from the coexistence of eddy fluctuations in an
eddy continuum, the larger scale eddies being the integrated mean of enclosed
smaller scale eddies. The model satisfies the maximum entropy principle and
predicts that the probability distributions of component eddy amplitudes and
the corresponding variances (power spectra) are quantified by the same
universal inverse power law distribution which is a function of the golden
mean. Atmospheric particulates are held in suspension by the vertical velocity
distribution (spectrum). The atmospheric particulate size spectrum is derived
in terms of the model predicted universal inverse power law characterizing
atmospheric eddy spectrum. Model predicted spectrum is in agreement with the
following four experimentally determined data sets: (i) CIRPAS mission
TARFOX_WALLOPS_SMPS aerosol size distributions (ii) CIRPAS mission ARM-IOP
(Ponca City, OK) aerosol size distributions (iii) SAFARI 2000 CV-580 (CARG
Aerosol and Cloud Data) cloud drop size distributions and (iv) TWP-ICE (Darwin,
Australia) rain drop size distributions.

    <title>The Laboratory Complex for the Calibration of Photometers Using the
  Optical Method for Determination of the Water Vapor Content in the Earth
  Atmosphere</title>
    <summary>  We describe the laboratory complex for the calibration of photometers that
are used in weather service to measure the water vapor content in the Earth
atmosphere. The complex was built up in Pulkovo Observatory and developed
within the framework of collaboration between Pulkovo Observatory and
Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory (Meteorologisches Observatorium
Lindenberg - Richard-A{\ss}mann-Observatorium, Lindenberg, Germany). It is used
to obtain calibration dependences for individual devices, and also to develop
and compare various methods of construction of calibration dependences. These
techniques are based on direct calibration of the photometers, on the use of
spectral laboratory transmission functions for water vapor, on calculation
methods using spectroscopical databases for individual lines. We hope that when
the parameters of the equipment are taken into account in detail and new
results for the absorptive power of water vapor are used, the accuracy of
determination of the water vapor content in the atmosphere of 1-2% may be
attained.

    <title>The Weather and its Role in Captain Robert F. Scott and his Companions'
  Deaths</title>
    <summary>  A long debate has ensued about the relationship of weather conditions and
Antarctic exploration. In no place on Earth is exploration, human existence,
and scientific research so weather dependent. By using an artificial neural
network simulation, historical (Heroic Age) and modern weather data from manned
and automated stations, placed at different locations of the Ross Ice Shelf,
and the Ross Island, I have examined minimum near surface air temperatures. All
modern meteorological data, as well as historical data of Cherry-Garrard, high
correlations between temperatures at different locations, and artificial neural
network retrodiction of modern and historical temperature data, point out the
oddity of Captain Scott's temperature recordings from February 27 - March 19,
1912. I was able to show that in this period the actual minimum near surface
air temperature was on the average about 13{\deg}F(7{\deg}C) above that
reported by Captain Scott and his party. On the basis of the mentioned evidence
I concluded that the real minimum near surface air temperature data was altered
by Lt. Bowers and Captain Scott to inflate and dramatize the weather
conditions.

    <title>Mesoscale optical turbulence simulations above Dome C, Dome A and South
  Pole</title>
    <summary>  In two recent papers the mesoscale model Meso-NH, joint with the
Astro-Meso-NH package, has been validated at Dome C, Antarctica, for the
characterization of the optical turbulence. It has been shown that the
meteorological parameters (temperature and wind speed, from which the optical
turbulence depends on) as well as the Cn2 profiles above Dome C were correctly
statistically reproduced. The three most important derived parameters that
characterize the optical turbulence above the internal antarctic plateau: the
surface layer thickness, the seeing in the free-atmosphere and in the total
atmosphere showed to be in a very good agreement with observations. Validation
of Cn2 has been performed using all the measurements of the optical turbulence
vertical distribution obtained in winter so far. In this paper, in order to
investigate the ability of the model to discriminate between different
turbulence conditions for site testing, we extend the study to two other
potential astronomical sites in Antarctica: Dome A and South Pole, which we
expect to be characterized by different turbulence conditions. The optical
turbulence has been calculated above these two sites for the same 15 nights
studied for Dome C and a comparison between the three sites has been performed.

    <title>Climatology of extratropical atmospheric wave packets in the northern
  hemisphere</title>
    <summary>  Planetary and synoptic scale wave-packets represent one important component
of the atmospheric large-scale circulation. These dissipative structures are
able to rapidly transport eddy kinetic energy, generated locally (e.g. by
baroclinic conversion), downstream along the upper tropospheric flow. The
transported energy, moving faster than individual weather systems, will affect
the development of the next meteorological system on the leading edge of the
wave packet, creating a chain of connections between systems that can be far
apart in time and space, with important implications on predictability. In this
work we present an automated recognition of atmospheric wave packets which
allows the extraction of all the relevant properties, such as location,
duration and velocity. Behind this tool lies the need to investigate
atmospheric variability in its full complexity, bridging the low-frequency
steady-state approach with the storm-tracks lagrangian approach. We have
applied the algorithm to the daily analysis (every 12h) from 1958-2010,
building an extended climatology of waves packets with different spectral
properties. We show that wave packets characteristics over Northern Hemisphere
exhibit a strong seasonal dependence, both in their spectral component and in
their distribution and localization. The maximum activity is reached in the
cold months, from autumn to spring, with a slight weakening in mid-winter and a
clear minimum of activity in summer. Preferential areas of genesis are shown to
be the Western and Central-Pacific and Western-Atlantic while areas of lyses
are the eastern borders of Pacific and Atlantic. We envisage possible
applications of this algorithm also for predictability studies and operational
activities.

    <title>A dedicated tool for a full 3D Cn2 investigation</title>
    <summary>  We present in this study a mapping of the optical turbulence (OT) above
different astronomical sites. The mesoscale model Meso-NH was used together
with the Astro-Meso-Nh package and a set of diagnostic tools allowing for a
full 3D investigation of the Cn2. The diagnostics implemented in the
Astro-Meso-Nh, allowing for a full 3D investigation of the OT structure in a
volumetric space above different sites, are presented. To illustrate the
different diagnostics and their potentialities, we investigated one night and
looked at instantaneous fields of meteorologic and astroclimatic parameters. To
show the potentialities of this tool for applications in an Observatory we ran
the model above sites with very different OT distributions: the antarctic
plateau (Dome C, Dome A, South Pole) and a mid-latitude site (Mt. Graham,
Arizona). We put particular emphasis on the 2D maps of integrated astroclimatic
parameters (seeing, isoplanatic angles) calculated in different slices at
different heights in the troposhere. This is an useful tool of prediction and
investigation of the turbulence structure. It can support the optimization of
the AO, GLAO and MCAO systems running at the focus of the ground-based
telescopes.From this studies it emerges that the astronomical sites clearly
present different OT behaviors. Besides, our tool allowed us for discriminating
these sites.

    <title>Synchronicity From Synchronized Chaos</title>
    <summary>  The synchronization of loosely coupled chaotic oscillators, a phenomenon
investigated intensively for the last two decades, may realize the
philosophical notion of synchronicity. Effectively unpredictable chaotic
systems, coupled through only a few variables, commonly exhibit a predictable
relationship that can be highly intermittent. We argue that the phenomenon
closely resembles the notion of meaningful synchronicity put forward by Jung
and Pauli if one identifies "meaningfulness" with internal synchronization,
since the latter seems necessary for synchronizability with an external system.
Jungian synchronization of mind and matter is realized if mind is analogized to
a computer model, synchronizing with a sporadically observed system as in
meteorological data assimilation. Internal synchronization provides a recipe
for combining different models of the same objective process, a configuration
that may also describe the functioning of conscious brains. In contrast to
Pauli's view, recent developments suggest a materialist picture of
semi-autonomous mind, existing alongside the observed world, with both
exhibiting a synchronistic order. Basic physical synchronicity is manifest in
the non-local quantum connections implied by Bell's theorem. The quantum world
resides on a generalized synchronization "manifold", a view that provides a
bridge between nonlocal realist interpretations and local realist
interpretations that constrain observer choice .

    <title>Present and Last Glacial Maximum climates as states of maximum entropy
  production</title>
    <summary>  The Earth, like other planets with a relatively thick atmosphere, is not
locally in radiative equilibrium and the transport of energy by the geophysical
fluids (atmosphere and ocean) plays a fundamental role in determining its
climate. Using simple energy-balance models, it was suggested a few decades ago
that the meridional energy fluxes might follow a thermodynamic Maximum Entropy
Production (MEP) principle. In the present study, we assess the MEP hypothesis
in the framework of a minimal climate model based solely on a robust radiative
scheme and the MEP principle, with no extra assumptions. Specifically, we show
that by choosing an adequate radiative exchange formulation, the Net Exchange
Formulation, a rigorous derivation of all the physical parameters can be
performed. The MEP principle is also extended to surface energy fluxes, in
addition to meridional energy fluxes. The climate model presented here is
extremely fast, needs very little empirical data and does not rely on ad hoc
parameterizations. We investigate its range of validity by comparing its
performances for pre-industrial climate and Last Glacial Maximum climate with
corresponding simulations with the IPSL coupled atmosphere-ocean General
Circulation Model IPSL_CM4, finding reasonable agreement. Beyond the practical
interest of this result for climate modelling, it supports the idea that, to a
certain extent, climate can be characterized with macroscale features with no
need to compute the underlying microscale dynamics.

    <title>Domenico Pacini, uncredited pioneer of the discovery of cosmic rays</title>
    <summary>  During a series of experiments performed between 1907 and 1911, Domenico
Pacini (Marino 1878-Roma 1934), at that time researcher at the Central Bureau
of Meteorology and Geodynamics in Roma, studied the origin of the radiation
today called "cosmic rays", the nature of which was unknown at that time. In
his conclusive measurements in June 1911 at the Naval Academy in Livorno, and
confirmed in Bracciano a couple of months later, Pacini, proposing a novel
experimental technique, observed the radiation strength to decrease when going
from the surface to a few meters underwater (both in the sea and in the lake),
thus demonstrating that such radiation could not come from the Earth's crust.
Pacini's work was largely overlooked. Hess was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Physics in 1936, two years after the death of Pacini, who had become a full
professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Bari. The discovery of
cosmic rays -a milestone in science- involved several scientists in Europe and
in the United States of America and took place during a period characterized by
nationalism and lack of communication. Historical, political and personal
facts, embedded in the pre- and post-World War I context, might have
contributed to the substantial disappearance of Pacini from the history of
science. This article aims to give an unbiased historical account of the
discovery of cosmic rays; in the centenary of Pacini's pioneering experiments,
his work, which employed a technique that was complementary to, and independent
of that of Hess, will be duly taken into consideration. A translation into
English of three fundamental early articles by Pacini is provided in the
Appendix.

    <title>Universal spectrum for atmospheric aerosol size distribution: comparison
  with pcasp-b observations of vocals 2008</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric flows exhibit scale-free fractal fluctuations. A general systems
theory based on classical statistical physical concepts visualizes the fractal
fluctuations to result from the coexistence of eddy fluctuations in an eddy
continuum, the larger scale eddies being the integrated mean of enclosed
smaller scale eddies. The model predicts (i) the eddy energy (variance)
spectrum and corresponding eddy amplitude probability distribution are
quantified by the same universal inverse power law distribution incorporating
the golden mean. (ii) The steady state ordered hierarchical growth of
atmospheric eddy continuum is associated with maximum entropy production. (iii)
atmospheric particulate size spectrum is derived in terms of the model
predicted universal inverse power law for atmospheric eddy energy spectrum.
Model predictions are in agreement with observations. Universal inverse power
law for power spectra of fractal fluctuations rules out linear secular trends
in meteorological parameters. Global warming related climate change, if any,
will be manifested as intensification of fluctuations of all scales manifested
immediately in high frequency fluctuations. The universal aerosol size spectrum
presented in this paper may be computed for any location with two measured
parameters, namely, the mean volume radius and the total number concentration
and may be incorporated in climate models for computation of radiation budget
of earth-atmosphere system.

    <title>Microburst nowcasting applications of GOES</title>
    <summary>  Recent testing and validation have found that the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) microburst products are effective in the
assessment and short-term forecasting of downburst potential and associated
wind gust magnitude. Two products, the GOES sounder Microburst Windspeed
Potential Index (MWPI) and a new bi-spectral GOES imager brightness temperature
difference (BTD) product have demonstrated capability in downburst potential
assessment. In addition, a comparison study between the GOES-R Convective
Overshooting Top (OT) Detection and MWPI algorithms has been completed for
cases that occurred during the 2007 to 2009 convective seasons over the
southern Great Plains. Favorable results of the comparison study include a
statistically significant negative correlation between the OT minimum
temperature and MWPI values and associated measured downburst wind gust
magnitude. The negative functional relationship between the OT parameters and
wind gust speed highlights the importance of updraft strength, realized by
large CAPE, in the generation of heavy precipitation and subsequent intense
convective downdraft generation. This paper provides an updated assessment of
the GOES MWPI and GOES BTD algorithms, presents case studies demonstrating
effective operational use of the microburst products, and presents results of a
cross comparison study of the GOES-R overshooting top (OT) detection algorithm
over the United States Great Plains region.

    <title>Point process modeling of wildfire hazard in Los Angeles County,
  California</title>
    <summary>  The Burning Index (BI) produced daily by the United States government's
National Fire Danger Rating System is commonly used in forecasting the hazard
of wildfire activity in the United States. However, recent evaluations have
shown the BI to be less effective at predicting wildfires in Los Angeles
County, compared to simple point process models incorporating similar
meteorological information. Here, we explore the forecasting power of a suite
of more complex point process models that use seasonal wildfire trends, daily
and lagged weather variables, and historical spatial burn patterns as
covariates, and that interpolate the records from different weather stations.
Results are compared with models using only the BI. The performance of each
model is compared by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), as well as by the
power in predicting wildfires in the historical data set and residual analysis.
We find that multiplicative models that directly use weather variables offer
substantial improvement in fit compared to models using only the BI, and, in
particular, models where a distinct spatial bandwidth parameter is estimated
for each weather station appear to offer substantially improved fit.

    <title>Astronomical Sky Quality Near Eureka, in the Canadian High Arctic</title>
    <summary>  Nighttime visible-light sky brightness and transparency are reported for the
Polar Environment Research Laboratory (PEARL), located on a 610-m high ridge
near the Eureka research station, on Ellesmere Island, Canada. Photometry of
Polaris obtained in V band with the PEARL All Sky Imager (PASI) over two
winters is supported by standard meteorological measurements and visual
estimates of sky conditions from sea level. These data show that during the
period of the study, October through March of 2008/09 and 2009/10, the sky near
zenith had a mean surface brightness of 19.7 mag/square-arcsec when the sun was
more than 12 deg below the horizon, reaching 20.7 mag/square-arcsec during
astronomical darkness with no moon. Skies were without thick cloud and
potentially usable for astronomy 86% of the time (extinction &lt;2 mag). Up to 68%
of the time was spectroscopic (&lt;0.5 mag), attenuated by ice crystals, or clear
with stable atmospheric transparency. Those conditions can persist for over 100
hours at a time. Further analysis suggests the sky was entirely free of ice
crystals (truly photometric) 48+/-3% of the time at PEARL in winter, and that a
higher elevation location nearby may be better.

    <title>A Low Mach Number Solver: Enhancing Applicability</title>
    <summary>  In astrophysics and meteorology there exist numerous situations where flows
exhibit small velocities compared to the sound speed. To overcome the stringent
timestep restrictions posed by the predominantly used explicit methods for
integration in time the Euler (or Navier-Stokes) equations are usually replaced
by modified versions. In astrophysics this is nearly exclusively the anelastic
approximation. Kwatra et al. have proposed a method with favourable time-step
properties integrating the original equations (and thus allowing, for example,
also the treatment of shocks). We describe the extension of the method to the
Navier-Stokes and two-component equations. - However, when applying the
extended method to problems in convection and double diffusive convection
(semiconvection) we ran into numerical difficulties. We describe our procedure
for stabilizing the method. We also investigate the behaviour of Kwatra et
al.'s method for very low Mach numbers (down to Ma = 0.001) and point out its
very favourable properties in this realm for situations where the explicit
counterpart of this method returns absolutely unusable results. Furthermore, we
show that the method strongly scales over 3 orders of magnitude of processor
cores and is limited only by the specific network structure of the high
performance computer we use.

    <title>Potential vorticity dynamics in the framework of disk shallow-water
  theory: II. Mixed Barotropic-Baroclinic Instability</title>
    <summary>  We extend exploration of potential vorticity instabilities in cold
astrophysical disks whose mean states are baroclinic. In particular, we seek to
demonstrate the potential existence of traditional baroclinic instabilities of
meteorological studies in a simplified two-layer Philips Disk Model. Each disk
layer is of constant but differing densities. The resulting mean azimuthal
velocity profile shows a variation in the vertical direction implying that the
system is baroclinic in the mean state. The stability of the system is treated
in the context of disk shallow water theory wherein azimuthal disturbances are
much longer than the corresponding radial or vertical scales. The normal-mode
problem is solved numerically using two different methods. The results of a
symmetric single layer barotropic model is considered and it is found that
instability persists for models in which the potential vorticity profiles are
not symmetric, consistent with previous results. The instaiblity is interpreted
in terms of interacting Rossby waves. For a two layer system in which the flow
is fundamentally baroclinic we report here that instability takes on the form
of mixed barotropic-baroclinic type: instability occurs but it qualitatively
follows the pattern of instability found in the barotropic models. Instability
arises because of the phase locking and interaction of the Rossby waves between
the two layers. The strength of the instability weakens as the density contrast
between layers increases. (For full abstract see article.)

    <title>Simulations of dispersion and deposition of coarse particulate matter</title>
    <summary>  In order to study the dispersion and deposition of coarse anthropogenic
particulate matter (PMc, aerodynamic diameters&gt; 10 mm), a FORTRAN simulator
based on the numerical integrator of Bulirsch and Stoer has been developed. It
calculates trajectories of particles of several shapes released into the
atmosphere under very general conditions. This first version, fully
three-dimensional, models the meteorology under neutral stability conditions.
The simulations of such pollutants are also important because the standard
software (usually originating in the United States Environmental Protection
Agency-EPA-) describe only the behavior of PM10 (diameter less than 10 mm).
Bulirsch and Stoer integrator of widespread use in astrophysics, is also very
fast and accurate for this type of simulations. We present 2D and 3D
trajectories in physical space and discuss the final deposition in function of
various parameters. PMc simulations results in the range of 50-100 mm and
densities of 5.5 g cm-3 emitted from chimneys, indicate that for the purpose of
deposition, the emission velocities are not as important as wind speed and the
shape of the particles. For densities less than 2 g cm-3, the lack of
consideration of buoyancy introduces important changes in the distribution of
deposited PMc.

    <title>Parallel grid library for rapid and flexible simulation development</title>
    <summary>  We present an easy to use and flexible grid library for developing highly
scalable parallel simulations. The distributed cartesian cell-refinable grid
(dccrg) supports adaptive mesh refinement and allows an arbitrary C++ class to
be used as cell data. The amount of data in grid cells can vary both in space
and time allowing dccrg to be used in very different types of simulations, for
example in fluid and particle codes. Dccrg transfers the data between
neighboring cells on different processes transparently and asynchronously
allowing one to overlap computation and communication. This enables excellent
scalability at least up to 32 k cores in magnetohydrodynamic tests depending on
the problem and hardware. In the version of dccrg presented here part of the
mesh metadata is replicated between MPI processes reducing the scalability of
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to between 200 and 600 processes. Dccrg is free
software that anyone can use, study and modify and is available at
[https://gitorious.org/dccrg]. Users are also kindly requested to cite this
work when publishing results obtained with dccrg.

    <title>Cloud Features and Zonal Wind Measurements of Saturn's Atmosphere as
  Observed by Cassini/VIMS</title>
    <summary>  We present an analysis of data about Saturn's atmosphere from Cassini's
Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS), focusing on the meteorology of
the features seen in the 5-micron spectral window. We present VIMS mosaics and
discuss the morphology and general characteristics of the features backlit by
Saturn's thermal emission. We have also constructed a zonal wind profile from
VIMS feature tracking observation sequences using an automated cloud feature
tracker. Comparison with previously constructed profiles from Voyager and
Cassini imaging data reveals broad similarities, suggesting minimal vertical
shear of the zonal wind. However, areas of apparent wind shear are present in
the VIMS zonal wind profile at jet stream cores. In particular, our analysis
shows that the equatorial jet reaches speeds exceeding 450 m/s, similar to
speeds obtained during the Voyager era. This suggests that recent inferences of
relatively slower jet speeds of ~275-375 m/s are confined to the upper
troposphere and that the deep (&gt;1 bar) jet has not experienced a significant
slowdown. Our measurements of the numerous dark, spotted features seen in the
VIMS mosaics reveals that most of these features have diameters less than 1000
km and reside in confined zonal bands between jet stream cores. We propose that
these spot features are vortices and that VIMS and ISS are sensing the same
vortices at two different pressure levels. The local structure at the zonal jet
streams remains complex, as VIMS may be sensing cloud features that are deeper
than the NH3 cloud deck.

    <title>Saharan mineral dust outbreaks observed over the North Atlantic island
  of La Palma in summertime between 1984 and 2012</title>
    <summary>  We estimate the frequency of Saharan mineral dust outbreak events observed
over the North Atlantic island of La Palma based on in situ nightly atmospheric
extinction measurements recorded almost continuously since 1984 by the
Carlsberg Meridian Telescope at the Roque de los Muchachos observatory. The
outbreak frequency shows a well-defined seasonal peak in the months of July to
September, during which time the occurrence of Saharan dust events (SDEs) is
approximately 28\pm6%. We find considerable year-to-year variability in the
summertime SDEs frequency, observing a steady reduction between 1984 and 1997,
followed by a period of relative mean stability from 1999 to 2012. We
investigated changes in the atmospheric extinction of the SDEs as an indicator
of strength of the episodes and found that this parameter approximately follows
the SDE frequency, however, instrumental limitations prevented us from deriving
precise conclusions regarding their long-term changes. A lagged correlation
analysis between SDE properties and the El Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation
(ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Sahel rainfall index (SRI) was
performed. We found that 55\pm4% of the year-to-year variations in
July-September SDE frequency may be reproduced by a lagged relationship to the
NAO conditions during the preceding October-December period, and 45\pm4% may be
reproduced by a negative correlation to the SRI during the preceding
February-April period. Based on these relationships it may be possible to
obtain an approximate indication of the strength of the upcoming summertime
dust season over the North Atlantic around half a year in advance.

    <title>First measurement of the small-scale spatial variability of the rain
  drop size distribution: Results from a crucial experiment and maximum entropy
  modeling</title>
    <summary>  The main challenges of measuring precipitation are related to the
spatio-temporal variability of the drop-size distribution, to the uncertainties
that condition the modeling of that distribution, and to the instrumental
errors present in the in situ estimations. This PhD dissertation proposes
advances in all these questions. The relevance of the spatial variability of
the drop-size distribution for remote sensing measurements and
hydro-meteorology field studies is asserted by analyzing the measurement of a
set of disdrometers deployed on a network of 5 squared kilometers. This study
comprises the spatial variability of integral rainfall parameters, the ZR
relationships, and the variations within the one moment scaling method. The
modeling of the drop-size distribution is analyzed by applying the MaxEnt
method and comparing it with the methods of moments and the maximum likelihood.
The instrumental errors are analyzed with a compressive comparison of sampling
and binning uncertainties that affect actual devices. These analysis are
further extended in several appendices where an error analysis is developed and
new studies are proposed. The relevance of the pre-processing of disdrometric
measurements is also assessed. The data-sets evaluated comprise experimental
measurements of the GPM (NASA-JAXA) ground validation satellite mission and
synthetic distributions generated computationally.

    <title>Atmospheric Circulation of Hot Jupiters: A Shallow Three-Dimensional
  Model</title>
    <summary>  Remote observing of exoplanetary atmospheres is now possible, offering us
access to circulation regimes unlike any of the familiar Solar System cases.
Atmospheric circulation models are being developed to study these new regimes
but model validations and intercomparisons are needed to establish their
consistency and accuracy. To this end, we present a simple Earth-like
validation of the pseudo-spectral solver of meteorological equations called
IGCM (Intermediate General Circulation Model), based on Newtonian relaxation to
a prescribed latitudinal profile of equilibrium temperatures. We then describe
a straightforward and idealized model extension to the atmospheric flow on a
hot Jupiter with the same IGCM solver. This shallow, three-dimensional hot
Jupiter model is based on Newtonian relaxation to a permanent day-night pattern
of equilibrium temperatures and the absence of surface drag. The baroclinic
regime of the Earth's lower atmosphere is contrasted with the more barotropic
regime of the simulated hot Jupiter flow. For plausible conditions at the 0.1-1
bar pressure level on HD 209458b, the simulated flow is characterized by
unsteadiness, subsonic wind speeds, a zonally-perturbed superrotating
equatorial jet and large scale polar vortices. Violation of the Rayleigh-Kuo
inflexion point criterion on the flanks of the accelerating equatorial jet
indicates that barotropic (horizontal shear) instabilities may be important
dynamical features of the simulated flow. Similarities and differences with
previously published simulated hot Jupiter flows are briefly noted.

    <title>Climate predictions: the chaos and complexity in climate models</title>
    <summary>  Some issues which are relevant for the recent state in climate modeling have
been considered. A detailed overview of literature related to this subject is
given. The concept in modeling of climate, as a complex system, seen through
Godel's Theorem and Rosen's definition of complexity and predictability is
discussed. It is pointed out to occurrence of chaos in computing the
environmental interface temperature from the energy balance equation given in a
difference form. A coupled system of equations, often used in climate models is
analyzed. It is shown that the Lyapunov exponent mostly has positive values
allowing presence of chaos in this systems. The horizontal energy exchange
between environmental interfaces, which is described by the dynamics of driven
coupled oscillators, is analyzed. Their behavior and synchronization, when a
perturbation is introduced in the system, as a function of the coupling
parameters, the logistic parameter and the parameter of exchange, was studied
calculating the Lyapunov exponent under simulations with the closed contour of
N=100 environmental interfaces. Finally, we have explored possible differences
in complexities of two global and two regional climate models using their
output time series by applying the algorithm for calculating the Kolmogorov
complexity.

    <title>On the computation of moist-air specific thermal enthalpy</title>
    <summary>  The specific thermal enthalpy of a moist-air parcel is defined analytically
following a method in which specific moist entropy is derived from the Third
Law of thermodynamics. Specific thermal enthalpy is computed by integrating
specific heat content with respect to absolute temperature and including the
impacts of various latent heats (i.e., solid condensation, sublimation,
melting, and evaporation). It is assumed that thermal enthalpies can be set to
zero at $0$ K for the solid form of the main chemically inactive components of
the atmosphere (solid-$\alpha$ oxygen and nitrogen, hexagonal ice). The moist
thermal enthalpy is compared to already existing formulations of moist static
energy (MSE). It is shown that the differences between thermal enthalpy and the
thermal part of MSE may be quite large. This prevents the use of MSE to
evaluate the enthalpy budget of a moist atmosphere accurately, a situation that
is particularly true when dry-air and cloud parcels mix because of
entrainment/detrainment processes along the edges of cloud. Other differences
are observed when MSE or moist-air thermal enthalpy is plotted on a
psychrometric diagram or when vertical profiles of surface deficit are plotted.

    <title>"Winter is coming"</title>
    <summary>  Those that do not sow care little about such mundane things as equinoxes or
planting seasons, or even crop rotation for that matter. Wherever and whenever
the reavers reave, the mood is always foul and the nights are never warm or
pleasant. For the rest of the good folks of Westeros, however, a decent grasp
of the long-term weather forecast is a necessity. Many a maester have tried to
play the Game of Weather Patterns and foretell when to plant those last turnip
seeds, hoping for a few more years of balmy respite. Tried and failed. For
other than the somewhat vague (if not outright meaningless) omens of "Winter is
Coming", their meteorological efforts have been worse than useless. To right
that appalling wrong, here we attempt to explain the apparently erratic
seasonal changes in the world of G.R.R.M. A natural explanation for such
phenomena is the unique behavior of a circumbinary planet. Thus, by speculating
that the planet under scrutiny is orbiting a pair of stars, we utilize the
power of numerical three-body dynamics to predict that, unfortunately, it is
not possible to predict either the length, or the severity of any coming
winter. We conclude that, alas, the Maesters were right -- one can only throw
their hands in the air in frustration and, defeated by non-analytic solutions,
mumble "Coming winter? May be long and nasty (~850 days, T&lt;268K) or may be
short and sweet (~600 days, T~273K). Who knows..."

    <title>Wind Energy: Forecasting Challenges for Its Operational Management</title>
    <summary>  Renewable energy sources, especially wind energy, are to play a larger role
in providing electricity to industrial and domestic consumers. This is already
the case today for a number of European countries, closely followed by the US
and high growth countries, for example, Brazil, India and China. There exist a
number of technological, environmental and political challenges linked to
supplementing existing electricity generation capacities with wind energy.
Here, mathematicians and statisticians could make a substantial contribution at
the interface of meteorology and decision-making, in connection with the
generation of forecasts tailored to the various operational decision problems
involved. Indeed, while wind energy may be seen as an environmentally friendly
source of energy, full benefits from its usage can only be obtained if one is
able to accommodate its variability and limited predictability. Based on a
short presentation of its physical basics, the importance of considering wind
power generation as a stochastic process is motivated. After describing
representative operational decision-making problems for both market
participants and system operators, it is underlined that forecasts should be
issued in a probabilistic framework. Even though, eventually, the forecaster
may only communicate single-valued predictions. The existing approaches to wind
power forecasting are subsequently described, with focus on single-valued
predictions, predictive marginal densities and space-time trajectories.
Upcoming challenges related to generating improved and new types of forecasts,
as well as their verification and value to forecast users, are finally
discussed.

    <title>Joint probabilistic forecasting of wind speed and temperature using
  Bayesian model averaging</title>
    <summary>  Ensembles of forecasts are typically employed to account for the forecast
uncertainties inherent in predictions of future weather states. However, biases
and dispersion errors often present in forecast ensembles require statistical
post-processing. Univariate post-processing models such as Bayesian model
averaging (BMA) have been successfully applied for various weather quantities.
Nonetheless, BMA and many other standard post-processing procedures are
designed for a single weather variable, thus ignoring possible dependencies
among weather quantities. In line with recently upcoming research to develop
multivariate post-processing procedures, e.g., BMA for bivariate wind vectors,
or flexible procedures applicable for multiple weather quantities of different
types, a bivariate BMA model for joint calibration of wind speed and
temperature forecasts is proposed based on the bivariate truncated normal
distribution. It extends the univariate truncated normal BMA model designed for
post-processing ensemble forecast of wind speed by adding a normally
distributed temperature component with a covariance structure representing the
dependency among the two weather quantities.
  The method is applied to wind speed and temperature forecasts of the
eight-member University of Washington mesoscale ensemble and of the
eleven-member ALADIN-HUNEPS ensemble of the Hungarian Meteorological Service
and its predictive performance is compared to that of the general Gaussian
copula method. The results indicate improved calibration of probabilistic and
accuracy of point forecasts in comparison to the raw ensemble and the overall
performance of this model is able to keep up with that of the Gaussian copula
method.

grids (smart grids) are equipped with smart sensors that allow to gather
real-time information regarding the physical status of all the component
elements belonging to the whole infrastructure (e.g., cables and related
insulation, transformers, breakers and so on). In real-world smart grid
systems, usually, additional information that are related to the operational
status of the grid itself are collected such as meteorological information.
Designing a suitable recognition (discrimination) model of faults in a
real-world smart grid system is hence a challenging task. This follows from the
heterogeneity of the information that actually determine a typical fault
condition. The second point is that, for synthesizing a recognition model, in
practice only the conditions of observed faults are usually meaningful.
Therefore, a suitable recognition model should be synthesized by making use of
the observed fault conditions only. In this paper, we deal with the problem of
modeling and recognizing faults in a real-world smart grid system, which
supplies the entire city of Rome, Italy. Recognition of faults is addressed by
following a combined approach of multiple dissimilarity measures customization
and one-class classification techniques. We provide here an in-depth study
related to the available data and to the models synthesized by the proposed
one-class classifier. We offer also a comprehensive analysis of the fault
recognition results by exploiting a fuzzy set based reliability decision rule.

    <title>Chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks - the effects of viscous
  accretion, turbulent mixing and disk winds</title>
    <summary>  We calculate the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks considering
radial viscous accretion, vertical turbulent mixing and vertical disk winds. We
study the effects on the disk chemical structure when different models for the
formation of molecular hydrogen on dust grains are adopted. Our gas-phase
chemistry is extracted from the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry (Rate06) to
which we have added detailed gas-grain interactions. We use our chemical model
results to generate synthetic near- and mid-infrared LTE line emission spectra
and compare these with recent Spitzer observations. Our results show that if H2
formation on warm grains is taken into consideration, the H2O and OH abundances
in the disk surface increase significantly. We find the radial accretion flow
strongly influences the molecular abundances, with those in the cold midplane
layers particularly affected. On the other hand, we show that diffusive
turbulent mixing affects the disk chemistry in the warm molecular layers,
influencing the line emission from the disk and subsequently improving
agreement with observations. We find that NH3, CH3OH, C2H2 and
sulphur-containing species are greatly enhanced by the inclusion of turbulent
mixing. We demonstrate that disk winds potentially affect the disk chemistry
and the resulting molecular line emission in a similar manner to that found
when mixing is included.

    <title>The available-enthalpy (flow-exergy) cycle. Part-II: applications to
  idealized baroclinic waves</title>
    <summary>  The local available-enthalpy cycle proposed in Part I of this paper is
applied to document energetics of three numerical simulations, representing
life cycles of idealized baroclinic waves. An improved temporal numerical
scheme defined in Part I is used in this study, together with the Arpege-IFS
model using a T42 triangular truncation. A 45{\deg}N and 200 hPa dry unstable
jet is constructed with the most unstable mode at zonal wave number 8.
Energetic impacts of both horizontal and vertical diffusion schemes are
determined separately. The role of ageostrophic winds within the Ekman layer is
investigated, leading to an explanation for large observed values for the
dissipation terms and to a new formulation of the potential-energy conversions.
The magnitudes of these new conversion terms are compared with those of the
usual barotropic and baroclinic conversions. A new version for the
available-enthalpy cycle is proposed. It is suitable for open systems and it
includes explicitly the potential-energy component as a transitional reservoir.
Finally, some results from Intensive Observing Period 15 of the Fronts and
Atlantic Storm-Track EXperiment (FASTEX) are compared with those from the
idealized diabatic experiment.

    <title>On the Motion of Falling Leaves</title>
    <summary>  This paper investigates the motion of falling leaves through modeling using
papers and the corresponding data collected from more than four thousands
experiments. Two series of experiments were designed in order to study the
relationship between different parameters which can affect different paths of
motion in leaves. In the first series of experiments, the shapes of the
potential paths that falling papers can take were investigated as a whole. A
new classification scheme was derived from these experiments, categorizing the
motion of falling sheets of paper based on the deviation from the original
point of release and the shape of the path they take on their descending
journey. We believe this new classification scheme can be very useful with
potential applications in various fields such as biology, meteorology, etc.; it
can also build a foundation for further experiments. The second set of
experiments was focused on the dynamics and shape of the motion of the falling
paper itself. It was observed from these experiments that there should be two
critical values for Froude number in the falling paper motion in regards to the
rotational motion. We also found that the most stable and dominant rotational
motions are those observed around the length axis as well as the ones along the
diagonal axis.

    <title>Power-Expected-Posterior Priors for Variable Selection in Gaussian
  Linear Models</title>
    <summary>  In the context of the expected-posterior prior (EPP) approach to Bayesian
variable selection in linear models, we combine ideas from power-prior and
unit-information-prior methodologies to simultaneously produce a
minimally-informative prior and diminish the effect of training samples. The
result is that in practice our power-expected-posterior (PEP) methodology is
sufficiently insensitive to the size n* of the training sample, due to PEP's
unit-information construction, that one may take n* equal to the full-data
sample size n and dispense with training samples altogether. In this paper we
focus on Gaussian linear models and develop our method under two different
baseline prior choices: the independence Jeffreys (or reference) prior,
yielding the J-PEP posterior, and the Zellner g-prior, leading to Z-PEP. We
find that, under the reference baseline prior, the asymptotics of PEP Bayes
factors are equivalent to those of Schwartz's BIC criterion, ensuring
consistency of the PEP approach to model selection. We compare the performance
of our method, in simulation studies and a real example involving prediction of
air-pollutant concentrations from meteorological covariates, with that of a
variety of previously-defined variants on Bayes factors for objective variable
selection. Our prior, due to its unit-information structure, leads to a
variable-selection procedure that (1) is systematically more parsimonious than
the basic EPP with minimal training sample, while sacrificing no desirable
performance characteristics to achieve this parsimony; (2) is robust to the
size of the training sample, thus enjoying the advantages described above
arising from the avoidance of training samples altogether; and (3) identifies
maximum-a-posteriori models that achieve good out-of-sample predictive
performance.

    <title>Coupled Mesoscale-Large-Eddy Modeling of Realistic Stable Boundary Layer
  Turbulence</title>
    <summary>  Site-specific flow and turbulence information are needed for various
practical applications, ranging from aerodynamic/aeroelastic modeling for wind
turbine design to optical diffraction calculations. Even though highly
desirable, collecting on-site meteorological measurements can be an expensive,
time-consuming, and sometimes a challenging task. In this work, we propose a
coupled mesoscale-large-eddy modeling framework to synthetically generate
site-specific flow and turbulence data. The workhorses behind our framework are
a state-of-the-art, open-source atmospheric model called the Weather Research
and Forecasting (WRF) model and a tuning-free large-eddy simulation (LES)
model.
  Using this coupled framework, we simulate a nighttime stable boundary layer
(SBL) case from the well-known CASES-99 field campaign. One of the unique
aspects of this work is the usage of a diverse range of observations for
characterization and validation. The coupled models reproduce certain
characteristics of observed low-level jets. They also capture various scaling
regimes of energy spectra, including the so-called spectral gap. However, the
coupled models are unable to capture the intermittent nature of the observed
surface fluxes. Lastly, we document and discuss: (i) the tremendous
spatio-temporal variabilities of observed and modeled SBL flow fields, and (ii)
the significant disagreements among different observational platforms. Based on
these results, we strongly recommend that future SBL modeling studies consider
rigorous validation exercises based on multi-sensor/multi-platform datasets.
  In summary, we believe that the numerical generation of realistic SBL is not
an impossible task. Without any doubt, there remain several computational and
fundamental challenges. The present work should be viewed as a first step to
confront some of these challenges.

    <title>The Site of the ASTRI SST-2M Telescope Prototype</title>
    <summary>  ASTRI is a Flagship Project financed by the Italian Ministry of Education,
University and Research, and led by the Italian National Institute of
Astrophysics, INAF. Primary goal of the ASTRI project is the design and
production of an end-to-end prototype of Small Size Telescope for the CTA
(Cherenkov Telescope Array) in a dual-mirror configuration (SST-2M) equipped
with a camera at the focal plane composed by an array of Silicon
Photo-Multipliers and devoted to the investigation of the highest gamma-ray
energy band. The ASTRI SST-2M prototype will be placed at the INAF M.G.
Fracastoro observing station in Serra La Nave on the Etna Mountain near
Catania, Italy. After the verification tests, devoted to probe the
technological solutions adopted, the ASTRI SST-2M prototype will perform
scientific observations on the Crab Nebula and on some of the brightest TeV
sources. Here we present the Serra La Nave site, its meteorological and weather
conditions, the sky darkness and visibility, and the complex of auxiliary
instrumentation that will be used on site to support the calibration and
science verification phase as well as the regular data reconstruction and
analysis of the ASTRI SST-2M prototype.

    <title>Time series modeling with pruned multi-layer perceptron and 2-stage
  damped least-squares method</title>
    <summary>  A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) defines a family of artificial neural networks
often used in TS modeling and forecasting. Because of its "black box" aspect,
many researchers refuse to use it. Moreover, the optimization (often based on
the exhaustive approach where "all" configurations are tested) and learning
phases of this artificial intelligence tool (often based on the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; LMA) are weaknesses of this approach
(exhaustively and local minima). These two tasks must be repeated depending on
the knowledge of each new problem studied, making the process, long, laborious
and not systematically robust. In this paper a pruning process is proposed.
This method allows, during the training phase, to carry out an inputs selecting
method activating (or not) inter-nodes connections in order to verify if
forecasting is improved. We propose to use iteratively the popular damped
least-squares method to activate inputs and neurons. A first pass is applied to
10% of the learning sample to determine weights significantly different from 0
and delete other. Then a classical batch process based on LMA is used with the
new MLP. The validation is done using 25 measured meteorological TS and
cross-comparing the prediction results of the classical LMA and the 2-stage
LMA.

    <title>Logarithmic Wind Profile: A Stability Wind Shear Term</title>
    <summary>  A stability wind shear term of logarithmic wind profile based on the terms of
turbulent kinetic energy equation is proposed. The fraction influenced by
thermal stratification is considered in the shear production term. This
thermally affected shear is compared with buoyant term resulting in a stability
wind shear term. It is also considered Reynolds stress as a sum of two
components associated with wind shear from mechanical and thermal
stratification process. The stability wind shear is responsible to Reynolds
stress of thermal stratification term, and also to Reynolds stress of
mechanical term at no neutral condition. The wind profile and its derivative
are validated with data from Pedra do Sal experiment in a flat terrain and 300m
from shoreline located in northeast coast of Brazil. It is close to the Equator
line, so the meteorological condition are strongly influenced by trade winds
and sea breeze. The site has one 100m tower with five instrumented levels, one
3D sonic anemometer, and a medium-range wind lidar profiler up 500m. The
dataset are processed and filter from September to November of 2013 which
results in about 550 hours of data available. The results show the derivative
of wind profile with R^2 of 0.87 and RMSE of 0.08 m/s. The calculated wind
profile performances well up to 400m at unstable condition and up to 280m at
stable condition with R^2 better than 0.89. The proposed equation is valid for
this specific site and is limited to a stead state condition with constant
turbulent fluxes in the surface layer.

    <title>Gaussian Random Functional Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Discrete
  Time Spatial Time Series Data</title>
    <summary>  Discrete time spatial time series data arise routinely in meteorological and
environmental studies. Inference and prediction associated with them are mostly
carried out using any of the several variants of the linear state space model
that are collectively called linear dynamic spatio-temporal models (LDSTMs).
However, real world environmental processes are highly complex and are seldom
representable by models with such simple linear structure. Hence, nonlinear
dynamic spatio-temporal models (NLDSTMs) based on the idea of nonlinear
observational and evolutionary equation have been proposed as an alternative.
However, in that case, the caveat lies in selecting the specific form of
nonlinearity from a large class of potentially appropriate nonlinear functions.
Moreover, modeling by NLDSTMs requires precise knowledge about the dynamics
underlying the data. In this article, we address this problem by introducing
the Gaussian random functional dynamic spatio-temporal model (GRFDSTM). Unlike
the LDSTMs or NLDSTMs, in GRFDSTM both the functions governing the
observational and evolutionary equations are composed of Gaussian random
functions. We exhibit many interesting theoretical properties of the GRFDSTM
and demonstrate how model fitting and prediction can be carried out coherently
in a Bayesian framework. We also conduct an extensive simulation study and
apply our model to a real, SO2 pollution data over Europe. The results are
highly encouraging.

    <title>Modelling turbulence effects in wildland fire propagation by the
  randomized level-set method</title>
    <summary>  Turbulence is of paramount importance in wildland fire propagation since it
randomly transports the hot air mass that can pre-heat and then ignite the area
ahead the fire. This contributes to give a random character to the firefront
position together with other phenomena as for example fire spotting, vegetation
distribution (patchiness), gaseous combustion fluctuation, small-scale terrain
elevation changes. Here only turbulence is considered. The level-set method is
used to numerically describe the evolution of the fireline contour that is
assumed to have a random motion because of turbulence. The progression of the
combustion process is then described by a level-set contour distributed
according to a weight function given by the probability density function of the
air particles in turbulent motion. From the comparison between the ordinary and
the randomized level-set methods, it emerges that the proposed modelling
approach turns out to be suitable to simulate a moving firefront fed by the
ground fuel and driven, beside the meteorological and orographical factors,
also by the turbulent diffusion of the hot air. This approach allows the
simulation of the fire overcoming of a firebreak zone. The discussed results
are explorative and need to be subjected to a future validation.

    <title>Downburst Prediction Applications of Meteorological Geostationary
  Satellites</title>
    <summary>  A suite of products has been developed and evaluated to assess hazards
presented by convective storm downbursts derived from the current generation of
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) (13-15). The existing
suite of GOES downburst prediction products employs the GOES sounder to
calculate risk based on conceptual models of favorable environmental profiles
for convective downburst generation. A diagnostic nowcasting product, the
Microburst Windspeed Potential Index (MWPI), is designed to infer attributes of
a favorable downburst environment: 1) the presence of large convective
available potential energy (CAPE), and 2) the presence of a surface-based or
elevated mixed layer with a steep temperature lapse rate and vertical relative
humidity gradient. These conditions foster intense convective downdrafts upon
the interaction of sub-saturated air in the elevated or sub-cloud mixed layer
with the storm precipitation core. This paper provides an updated assessment of
the MWPI algorithm, presents recent case studies demonstrating effective
operational use of the MWPI product over the Atlantic coastal region, and
presents validation results for the United States Great Plains and Mid-Atlantic
coastal region. In addition, an application of the brightness temperature
difference (BTD) between GOES imager water vapor (6.5{\mu}m) and thermal
infrared (11{\mu}m) channels that identifies regions where downbursts are
likely to develop, due to mid-tropospheric dry air entrainment, will be
outlined.

    <title>Accounting for model error due to unresolved scales within ensemble
  Kalman filtering</title>
    <summary>  We propose a method to account for model error due to unresolved scales in
the context of the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF). The approach
extends to this class of algorithms the deterministic model error formulation
recently explored for variational schemes and extended Kalman filter. The model
error statistic required in the analysis update is estimated using historical
reanalysis increments and a suitable model error evolution law. Two different
versions of the method are described; a time-constant model error treatment
where the same model error statistical description is time-invariant, and a
time-varying treatment where the assumed model error statistics is randomly
sampled at each analysis step. We compare both methods with the standard method
of dealing with model error through inflation and localization, and illustrate
our results with numerical simulations on a low order nonlinear system
exhibiting chaotic dynamics. The results show that the filter skill is
significantly improved through the proposed model error treatments, and that
both methods require far less parameter tuning than the standard approach.
Furthermore, the proposed approach is simple to implement within a pre-existing
ensemble based scheme. The general implications for the use of the proposed
approach in the framework of square-root filters such as the ETKF are also
discussed.

    <title>Architecture of Environmental Risk Modelling: for a faster and more
  robust response to natural disasters</title>
    <summary>  Demands on the disaster response capacity of the European Union are likely to
increase, as the impacts of disasters continue to grow both in size and
frequency. This has resulted in intensive research on issues concerning
spatially-explicit information and modelling and their multiple sources of
uncertainty. Geospatial support is one of the forms of assistance frequently
required by emergency response centres along with hazard forecast and event
management assessment. Robust modelling of natural hazards requires dynamic
simulations under an array of multiple inputs from different sources.
Uncertainty is associated with meteorological forecast and calibration of the
model parameters. Software uncertainty also derives from the data
transformation models (D-TM) needed for predicting hazard behaviour and its
consequences. On the other hand, social contributions have recently been
recognized as valuable in raw-data collection and mapping efforts traditionally
dominated by professional organizations. Here an architecture overview is
proposed for adaptive and robust modelling of natural hazards, following the
Semantic Array Programming paradigm to also include the distributed array of
social contributors called Citizen Sensor in a semantically-enhanced strategy
for D-TM modelling. The modelling architecture proposes a multicriteria
approach for assessing the array of potential impacts with qualitative rapid
assessment methods based on a Partial Open Loop Feedback Control (POLFC) schema
and complementing more traditional and accurate a-posteriori assessment. We
discuss the computational aspect of environmental risk modelling using
array-based parallel paradigms on High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms,
in order for the implications of urgency to be introduced into the systems
(Urgent-HPC).

    <title>Incorporating geostrophic wind information for improved space-time
  short-term wind speed forecasting</title>
    <summary>  Accurate short-term wind speed forecasting is needed for the rapid
development and efficient operation of wind energy resources. This is, however,
a very challenging problem. Although on the large scale, the wind speed is
related to atmospheric pressure, temperature, and other meteorological
variables, no improvement in forecasting accuracy was found by incorporating
air pressure and temperature directly into an advanced space-time statistical
forecasting model, the trigonometric direction diurnal (TDD) model. This paper
proposes to incorporate the geostrophic wind as a new predictor in the TDD
model. The geostrophic wind captures the physical relationship between wind and
pressure through the observed approximate balance between the pressure gradient
force and the Coriolis acceleration due to the Earth's rotation. Based on our
numerical experiments with data from West Texas, our new method produces more
accurate forecasts than does the TDD model using air pressure and temperature
for 1- to 6-hour-ahead forecasts based on three different evaluation criteria.
Furthermore, forecasting errors can be further reduced by using moving average
hourly wind speeds to fit the diurnal pattern. For example, our new method
obtains between 13.9% and 22.4% overall mean absolute error reduction relative
to persistence in 2-hour-ahead forecasts, and between 5.3% and 8.2% reduction
relative to the best previous space-time methods in this setting.

    <title>Renewable Energy-Aware Information-Centric Networking</title>
    <summary>  The ICT industry today is placed as one of the major consumers of energy,
where recent reports have also shown that the industry is a major contributor
to global carbon emissions. While renewable energy-aware data centers have been
proposed, these solutions have certain limitations. The primary limitation is
due to the design of data centers which focus on large-size facilities located
in selected locations. This paper addresses this problem, by utilizing
in-network caching with each router having storage and being powered by
renewable energy sources (wind and solar). Besides placing contents closer to
end users, utilizing in-network caching could potentially increase probability
of capturing renewable energy in diverse geographical locations. Our proposed
solution is dual- layered: on the first layer a distributed gradient-based
routing protocol is used to discover the paths along routers that are powered
by the highest renewable energy, and on the second layer, a caching mechanism
will pull the contents from the data centre and place them on routers of the
paths that are discovered by our routing protocol. Through our experiments on a
testbed utilizing real meteorological data, our proposed solution has
demonstrated increased quantity of renewable energy consumption, while reducing
the workload on the data centers.

    <title>The effective equation method</title>
    <summary>  In this chapter we present a general method of constructing the effective
equation which describes the behaviour of small-amplitude solutions for a
nonlinear PDE in finite volume, provided that the linear part of the equation
is a hamiltonian system with a pure imaginary discrete spectrum. The effective
equation is obtained by retaining only the resonant terms of the nonlinearity
(which may be hamiltonian, or may be not); the assertion that it describes the
limiting behaviour of small-amplitude solutions is a rigorous mathematical
theorem. In particular, the method applies to the three-- and four--wave
systems. We demonstrate that different possible types of energy transport are
covered by this method, depending on whether the set of resonances splits into
finite clusters (this happens, e.g. in case of the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima
equation), or is connected (this happens, e.g. in the case of the NLS equation
if the space-dimension is at least two). For equations of the first type the
energy transition to high frequencies does not hold, while for equations of the
second type it may take place. In the case of the NLS equation we use next some
heuristic approximation from the arsenal of wave turbulence to show that under
the iterated limit "the volume goes to infinity", taken after the limit "the
amplitude of oscillations goes to zero", the energy spectrum of solutions for
the effective equation is described by a Zakharov-type kinetic equation.
Evoking the Zakharov ansatz we show that stationary in time and homogeneous in
space solutions for the latter equation have a power law form. Our method
applies to various weakly nonlinear wave systems, appearing in plasma,
meteorology and oceanology.

    <title>Exoplanetary Geophysics -- An Emerging Discipline</title>
    <summary>  Thousands of extrasolar planets have been discovered, and it is clear that
the galactic planetary census draws on a diversity greatly exceeding that
exhibited by the solar system's planets. We review significant landmarks in the
chronology of extrasolar planet detection, and we give an overview of the
varied observational techniques that are brought to bear. We then discuss the
properties of the currently known distribution, using the mass-period diagram
as a guide to delineating hot Jupiters, eccentric giant planets, and a third,
highly populous, category that we term "ungiants", planets having masses less
than 30 Earth masses and orbital periods less than 100 days. We then move to a
discussion of the bulk compositions of the extrasolar planets. We discuss the
long-standing problem of radius anomalies among giant planets, as well as
issues posed by the unexpectedly large range in sizes observed for planets with
masses somewhat greater than Earth's. We discuss the use of transit
observations to probe the atmospheres of extrasolar planets; various
measurements taken during primary transit, secondary eclipse, and through the
full orbital period, can give clues to the atmospheric compositions,
structures, and meteorologies. The extrasolar planet catalog, along with the
details of our solar system and observations of star-forming regions and
protoplanetary disks, provide a backdrop for a discussion of planet formation
in which we review the elements of the favored pictures for how the terrestrial
and giant planets were assembled. We conclude by listing several research
questions that are relevant to the next ten years and beyond.

    <title>Forecast of surface layer meteorological parameters at Cerro Paranal
  with a mesoscale atmospherical model</title>
    <summary>  This article aims at proving the feasibility of the forecast of all the most
relevant classical atmospherical parameters for astronomical applications (wind
speed and direction, temperature) above the ESO ground-base site of Cerro
Paranal with a mesoscale atmospherical model called Meso-Nh. In a precedent
paper we have preliminarily treated the model performances obtained in
reconstructing some key atmospherical parameters in the surface layer 0-30~m
studying the bias and the RMSE on a statistical sample of 20 nights. Results
were very encouraging and it appeared therefore mandatory to confirm such a
good result on a much richer statistical sample. In this paper, the study was
extended to a total sample of 129 nights between 2007 and 2011 distributed in
different parts of the solar year. This large sample made our analysis more
robust and definitive in terms of the model performances and permitted us to
confirm the excellent performances of the model. Besides, we present an
independent analysis of the model performances using the method of the
contingency tables. Such a method permitted us to provide complementary key
informations with respect to the bias and the RMSE particularly useful for an
operational implementation of a forecast system.

    <title>Differential measurement of atmospheric refraction with a telescope with
  double fields of view</title>
    <summary>  For the sake of complete theoretical research of atmospheric refraction, the
atmospheric refraction under the condition of lower angles of elevation is
still worthy to be analyzed and explored. In some engineering applications, the
objects with larger zenith distance must be observed sometimes. Carrying out
observational research of the atmospheric refraction at lower angles of
elevation has an important significance. It has been considered difficult to
measure the atmospheric refraction at lower angles of elevation. A new idea for
determining atmospheric refraction by utilizing differential measurement with
double fields of view is proposed. Taking the observational principle of
HIPPARCOS satellite as a reference, a schematic prototype with double fields of
view was developed. In August of 2013, experimental observations were carried
out and the atmospheric refractions at lower angles of elevation can be
obtained by the schematic prototype. The measured value of the atmospheric
refraction at the zenith distance of 78.8 degree is $240.23"\pm0.27"$, and the
feasibility of differential measurement of atmospheric refraction with double
fields of view was justified. The limitations of the schematic prototype such
as inadequate ability of gathering light, lack of accurate meteorological data
recording and lower automatic level of observation and data processing were
also pointed out, which need to be improved in subsequent work.

    <title>Astronomical Site Selection for Turkey Using GIS Techniques</title>
    <summary>  A site selection of potential observatory locations in Turkey have been
carried out by using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) coupled with
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and satellite imagery which in turn
reduced cost and time and increased the accuracy of the final outcome. The
layers of cloud cover, digital elevation model, artificial lights, precipitable
water vapor, aerosol optical thickness and wind speed were studied in the GIS
system. In conclusion of MCDA, the most suitable regions were found to be
located in a strip crossing from southwest to northeast including also a
diverted region in southeast of Turkey. These regions are thus our prime
candidate locations for future on-site testing. In addition to this major
outcome, this study has also been applied to locations of major observatories
sites. Since no goal is set for \textit{the best}, the results of this study is
limited with a list of positions. Therefore, the list has to be further
confirmed with on-site tests. A national funding has been awarded to produce a
prototype of an on-site test unit (to measure both astronomical and
meteorological parameters) which might be used in this list of locations.

    <title>Optical Turbulence Characterization at LAMOST Site: Observations and
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric optical turbulence seriously limits the performance of high
angular resolution instruments. An 8-night campaign of measurements was carried
out at the LAMOST site in 2011, to characterize the optical turbulence. Two
instruments were set up during the campaign: a Differential Image Motion
Monitor (DIMM) used to measure the total atmospheric seeing, and a Single Star
Scidar (SSS) to measure the vertical profiles of the turbulence C_n^2(h) and
the horizontal wind velocity V(h). The optical turbulence parameters are also
calculated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with
the Trinquet-Vernin model, which describes optical effects of atmospheric
turbulence by using the local meteorological parameters. This paper presents
assessment of the optical parameters involved in high angular resolution
astronomy. Its includes seeing, isoplanatic angle, coherence time, coherence
etendue, vertical profiles of optical turbulence intensity _n^2(h)$ and
horizontal wind speed V(h). The median seeing is respectively 1.01 arcsec, 1.17
arcsec and 1.07arcsec as measured with the DIMM, the SSS and predicted with WRF
model. The history of seeing measurements at the LAMOST site are reviewed, and
the turbulence measurements in this campaign are compared with other
astronomical observatories in the world.

    <title>Mixture EMOS model for calibrating ensemble forecasts of wind speed</title>
    <summary>  Ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) is a statistical tool for
post-processing forecast ensembles of weather variables obtained from multiple
runs of numerical weather prediction models in order to produce calibrated
predictive probability density functions (PDFs). The EMOS predictive PDF is
given by a parametric distribution with parameters depending on the ensemble
forecasts. We propose an EMOS model for calibrating wind speed forecasts based
on weighted mixtures of truncated normal (TN) and log-normal (LN) distributions
where model parameters and component weights are estimated by optimizing the
values of proper scoring rules over a rolling training period. The new model is
tested on wind speed forecasts of the 50 member European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble, the 11 member Aire Limit\'ee
Adaptation dynamique D\'eveloppement International-Hungary Ensemble Prediction
System ensemble of the Hungarian Meteorological Service and the eight-member
University of Washington mesoscale ensemble, and its predictive performance is
compared to that of various benchmark EMOS models based on single parametric
families and combinations thereof. The results indicate improved calibration of
probabilistic and accuracy of point forecasts in comparison with the raw
ensemble and climatological forecasts. The mixture EMOS model significantly
outperforms the TN and LN EMOS methods, moreover, it provides better calibrated
forecasts than the TN-LN combination model and offers an increased flexibility
while avoiding covariate selection problems.

    <title>A data-driven method for the stochastic parametrisation of subgrid-scale
  tropical convective area fraction</title>
    <summary>  Observations of tropical convection from precipitation radar and the
concurring large-scale atmospheric state at two locations (Darwin and
Kwajalein) are used to establish effective stochastic models to parameterise
subgrid-scale tropical convective activity. Two approaches are presented which
rely on the assumption that tropical convection induces a stationary
equilibrium distribution. In the first approach we parameterise convection
variables such as convective area fraction as an instantaneous random
realisation conditioned on the large-scale vertical velocities according to a
probability density function estimated from the observations. In the second
approach convection variables are generated in a Markov process conditioned on
the large-scale vertical velocity, allowing for non-trivial temporal
correlations. Despite the different prevalent atmospheric and oceanic regimes
at the two locations, with Kwajalein being exposed to a purely oceanic weather
regime and Darwin exhibiting land-sea interaction, we establish that the
empirical measure for the convective variables conditioned on large-scale
mid-level vertical velocities for the two locations are close. This allows us
to train the stochastic models at one location and then generate time series of
convective activity at the other location. The proposed stochastic
subgrid-scale models adequately reproduce the statistics of the observed
convective variables and we discuss how they may be used in future
scale-independent mass-flux convection parameterisations.

    <title>On the use of Standardized Precipitation Index(SPI) for drought
  intensity assessment</title>
    <summary>  Monthly rainfall data from June to October for 39 years was used to generate
Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values based on Gamma distribution for a
low rainfall and a high rainfall district of Andhra Pradesh state, India.
Comparison of SPI, with actual rainfall and rainfall deviation from the mean
indicated that SPI values under-estimate the intensity of dryness/wetness when
the rainfall is very low/very high respectively. As a result, the SPI in the
worst drought years of 2002 and 2006 in the low rainfall district has indicated
only moderate dryness instead of extreme dryness. The range of SPI values of
the high rainfall district indicated better stretching, compared to that of the
low rainfall district. Further, the SPI values of longer time scale (2-, 3- and
4- months) showed an extended range compared to 1-month, but the sensitivity in
drought years has not improved significantly.
  To ascertain whether non normality of SPI is a possible reason, normality
tests were conducted. The Shapiro-Wilk statistic, p-values and absolute value
of the median confirmed normal distribution of SPI in both the districts
whereas cumulative probability distribution of SPI indicated deviation from
normal probability in the lower and upper ranges.
  Therefore, it is suggested that SPI as a stand alone indicator needs to be
interpreted with caution to assess the intensity of drought. Further
investigations should include; sensitivity of SPI to the estimated shape and
scale at lower and upper bounds of gamma and impact of other distributions such
as Pearson III on SPI computation, to complement the above results.

    <title>Censored and shifted gamma distribution based EMOS model for
  probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasting</title>
    <summary>  Recently all major weather prediction centres provide forecast ensembles of
different weather quantities which are obtained from multiple runs of numerical
weather prediction models with various initial conditions and model
parametrizations. However, ensemble forecasts often show an underdispersive
character and may also be biased, so that some post-processing is needed to
account for these deficiencies. Probably the most popular modern
post-processing techniques are the ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) and
the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) which provide estimates of the density of
the predictable weather quantity.
  In the present work an EMOS method for calibrating ensemble forecasts of
precipitation accumulation is proposed, where the predictive distribution
follows a censored and shifted gamma (CSG) law with parameters depending on the
ensemble members. The CSG EMOS model is tested on ensemble forecasts of 24 h
precipitation accumulation of the eight-member University of Washington
mesoscale ensemble and on the 11 member ensemble produced by the operational
Limited Area Model Ensemble Prediction System of the Hungarian Meteorological
Service. The predictive performance of the new EMOS approach is compared with
the fit of the raw ensemble, the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution
based EMOS model and the gamma BMA method. According to the results, the
proposed CSG EMOS model slightly outperforms the GEV EMOS approach in terms of
calibration of probabilistic and accuracy of point forecasts and shows
significantly better predictive skill that the raw ensemble and the BMA model.

    <title>Atmospheric electrification in dusty, reactive gases in the solar system
  and beyond</title>
    <summary>  Detailed observations of the solar system planets reveal a wide variety of
local atmospheric conditions. Astronomical observations have revealed a variety
of extrasolar planets none of which resembles any of the solar system planets
in full. Instead, the most massive amongst the extrasolar planets, the gas
giants, appear very similar to the class of (young) Brown Dwarfs which are
amongst the oldest objects in the universe. Despite of this diversity, solar
system planets, extrasolar planets and Brown Dwarfs have broadly similar global
temperatures between 300K and 2500K. In consequence, clouds of different
chemical species form in their atmospheres. While the details of these clouds
differ, the fundamental physical processes are the same. Further to this, all
these objects were observed to produce radio and X-ray emission. While both
kinds of radiation are well studied on Earth and to a lesser extent on the
solar system planets, the occurrence of emission that potentially originate
from accelerated electrons on Brown Dwarfs, extrasolar planets and
protoplanetary disks is not well understood yet. This paper offers an
interdisciplinary view on electrification processes and their feedback on their
hosting environment in meteorology, volcanology, planetology and research on
extrasolar planets and planet formation.

    <title>Disaggregation of SMAP L3 Brightness Temperatures to 9km using Kernel
  Machines</title>
    <summary>  In this study, a machine learning algorithm is used for disaggregation of
SMAP brightness temperatures (T$_{\textrm{B}}$) from 36km to 9km. It uses image
segmentation to cluster the study region based on meteorological and land cover
similarity, followed by a support vector machine based regression that computes
the value of the disaggregated T$_{\textrm{B}}$ at all pixels. High resolution
remote sensing products such as land surface temperature, normalized difference
vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, precipitation, soil texture, and
land-cover were used for disaggregation. The algorithm was implemented in Iowa,
United States, from April to July 2015, and compared with the SMAP L3_SM_AP
T$_{\textrm{B}}$ product at 9km. It was found that the disaggregated
T$_{\textrm{B}}$ were very similar to the SMAP-T$_{\textrm{B}}$ product, even
for vegetated areas with a mean difference $\leq$ 5K. However, the standard
deviation of the disaggregation was lower by 7K than that of the AP product.
The probability density functions of the disaggregated T$_{\textrm{B}}$ were
similar to the SMAP-T$_{\textrm{B}}$. The results indicate that this algorithm
may be used for disaggregating T$_{\textrm{B}}$ using complex non-linear
correlations on a grid.

    <title>Spatial Scaling of Satellite Soil Moisture using Temporal Correlations
  and Ensemble Learning</title>
    <summary>  A novel algorithm is developed to downscale soil moisture (SM), obtained at
satellite scales of 10-40 km by utilizing its temporal correlations to
historical auxiliary data at finer scales. Including such correlations
drastically reduces the size of the training set needed, accounts for
time-lagged relationships, and enables downscaling even in the presence of
short gaps in the auxiliary data. The algorithm is based upon bagged regression
trees (BRT) and uses correlations between high-resolution remote sensing
products and SM observations. The algorithm trains multiple regression trees
and automatically chooses the trees that generate the best downscaled
estimates. The algorithm was evaluated using a multi-scale synthetic dataset in
north central Florida for two years, including two growing seasons of corn and
one growing season of cotton per year. The time-averaged error across the
region was found to be 0.01 $\mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{m}^3$, with a standard
deviation of 0.012 $\mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{m}^3$ when 0.02% of the data were used
for training in addition to temporal correlations from the past seven days, and
all available data from the past year. The maximum spatially averaged errors
obtained using this algorithm in downscaled SM were 0.005
$\mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{m}^3$, for pixels with cotton land-cover. When land
surface temperature~(LST) on the day of downscaling was not included in the
algorithm to simulate "data gaps", the spatially averaged error increased
minimally by 0.015 $\mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{m}^3$ when LST is unavailable on the
day of downscaling. The results indicate that the BRT-based algorithm provides
high accuracy for downscaling SM using complex non-linear spatio-temporal
correlations, under heterogeneous micro meteorological conditions.

    <title>Cumulus Parameterization: Those Who Can Remember the Past Are Condemned
  to Repeat It</title>
    <summary>  Moist convection plays a leading role in the dynamics and energy budget of
Earth's tropics and influences the sensitivity of Earth's climate to greenhouse
gas increases. Because individual convective cells are much smaller than the
gridboxes of 3-dimensional global climate models (GCMs), these models
parameterize the effects of an ensemble of moist convective updrafts and
downdrafts on the environment. Cumulus parameterization has been a focus of the
terrestrial meteorology community for half a century. Only in past decade,
however, have GCMs with moist convective physics been applied to other planets.
Given our lack of detailed knowledge about convective clouds except on Earth,
planetary GCMs are often designed with very simple approaches to cumulus
parameterization, adopted from the earliest generations of terrestrial GCMs.
These parameterizations were based on breakthroughs in understanding of
convection in their time. However, at the same time that planetary GCMs have
begun to emerge, a quiet revolution in how we think about terrestrial
convection has started to influence the design of terrestrial GCMs. In this
paper we review how some of the assumptions in the classical cumulus
parameterizations used in planetary GCMs (and still in some terrestrial GCMs)
have given way in recent years to a deeper understanding of how convection
operates and why it matters for atmospheric dynamics and climate - on any
planet.

    <title>Observation of intrinsically bright terrestrial gamma ray flashes from
  the Mediterranean basin</title>
    <summary>  We present three terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) observed over the
Mediterranean basin by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager
(RHESSI) satellite. Since the occurrence of these events in the Mediterranean
region is quite rare, the characterisation of the events was optimised by
combining different approaches in order to better define the cloud of origin.
The TGFs on 7 November 2004 and 16 October 2006 came from clouds with cloud top
higher than 10-12 km where often a strong penetration into the stratosphere is
found. This kind of cloud is usually associated with heavy precipitation and
intense lightning activity. Nevertheless, the analysis of the cloud type based
on satellite retrievals shows that the TGF on 27 May 2004 was produced by an
unusual shallow convection. This result appears to be supported by the model
simulation of the particle distribution and phase in the upper troposphere. The
TGF on 7 November 2004 is among the brightest ever measured by RHESSI. The
analysis of the energy spectrum of this event is consistent with a production
altitude $\leq$12 km, which is in the upper part of the cloud, as found by the
meteorological analysis of the TGF-producing thunderstorm. This event must be
unusually bright at the source in order to produce such a strong signal in
RHESSI. We estimate that this TGF must contain $\sim$3x10$\rm ^{18}$ initial
photons with energy $&gt;$1 MeV. This is 1 order of magnitude brighter than
earlier estimations of an average RHESSI TGF.

    <title>A large-scale view of Space Technology 5 magnetometer response to solar
  wind drivers</title>
    <summary>  In this data report we discuss reprocessing of the Space Technology 5 (ST5)
magnetometer database for inclusion in NASA's Coordinated Data Analysis Web
(CDAWeb) virtual observatory. The mission consisted of three spacecraft flying
in elliptical orbits, from 27 March to 27 June 2006. Reprocessing includes (1)
transforming the data into the Modified Apex Coordinate System for projection
to a common reference altitude of 110km, (2) correcting gain jumps, and (3)
validating the results. We display the averaged magnetic perturbations as a
keogram, which allows direct comparison of the full-mission data with the solar
wind values and geomagnetic indices.With the data referenced to a common
altitude, we find the following: (1) Magnetic perturbations that track the
passage of corotating interaction regions and high-speed solar wind; (2)
unexpectedly strong dayside perturbations during a solstice magnetospheric
sawtooth oscillation interval characterized by a radial interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF) component that may have enhanced the accompanying modest southward
IMF; and (3) intervals of reduced magnetic perturbations or "calms," associated
with periods of slow solar wind, interspersed among variable-length episodic
enhancements. These calms aremost evidentwhen the IMF is northward or
projectswith a northward component onto the geomagnetic dipole. The reprocessed
ST5 data are in very good agreement with magnetic perturbations from the
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft, which we also map
to 110km. We briefly discuss the methods used to remap the ST5 data and the
means of validating the results against DMSP. Our methods form the basis for
future intermission comparisons of space-based magnetometer data.

    <title>A Bayesian hierarchical model for monthly maxima of instantaneous flow</title>
    <summary>  We propose a comprehensive Bayesian hierarchical model for monthly maxima of
instantaneous flow in river catchments. The Gumbel distribution is used as the
probabilistic model for the observations, which are assumed to come from
several catchments. Our suggested latent model is Gaussian and designed for
monthly maxima, making better use of the data than the standard approach using
annual maxima. At the latent level, linear mixed models are used for both the
location and scale parameters of the Gumbel distribution, accounting for
seasonal dependence and covariates from the catchments. The specification of
prior distributions makes use of penalised complexity (PC) priors, to ensure
robust inference for the latent parameters. The main idea behind the PC priors
is to shrink toward a base model, thus avoiding overfitting. PC priors also
provide a convenient framework for prior elicitation based on simple notions of
scale. Prior distributions for regression coefficients are also elicited based
on hydrological and meteorological knowledge. Posterior inference was done
using the MCMC split sampler, an efficient Gibbs blocking scheme tailored to
latent Gaussian models. The proposed model was applied to observed data from
eight river catchments in Iceland. A cross-validation study demonstrates good
predictive performance.

    <title>Optimal combination of energy storages for prospective power supply
  systems based on Renewable Energy Sources</title>
    <summary>  Prospective power supply systems based on Renewable Energy Sources require
measures to balance power generation and load at all times. The utilisation of
storage devices and backup power plants is widely suggested for this purpose,
whereas the best combination is still to be found. In this work, we present a
modelling approach to systematically study scenarios of future power supply
systems with a high share of electricity originating from wind and solar
resources. By considering backup as a subordinate source of electricity with
energy-only costs, the approach is independent of the actual full-load hours of
the backup power plants. Applying the approach to multi-year meteorological
data for Germany, cost-optimised combinations of storage devices and backup
power are identified. We find that even in scenarios with significant excess
generation capacities there is a need for storage devices or backup power
plants with discharging power on the same order as the average load to balance
the system at all times. Furthermore, these capacities seem to be required in
some years of the multi-year period only. Our results imply that the societal
need of having electricity available at all times can likely be satisfied by
installing over-capacities only, whereas a balance has to be found between
installing additional backup or storage or generation capacities.

    <title>pg-Causality: Identifying Spatiotemporal Causal Pathways for Air
  Pollutants with Urban Big Data</title>
    <summary>  Many countries are suffering from severe air pollution. Understanding how
different air pollutants accumulate and propagate is critical to making
relevant public policies. In this paper, we use urban big data (air quality
data and meteorological data) to identify the \emph{spatiotemporal (ST) causal
pathways} for air pollutants. This problem is challenging because: (1) there
are numerous noisy and low-pollution periods in the raw air quality data, which
may lead to unreliable causality analysis, (2) for large-scale data in the ST
space, the computational complexity of constructing a causal structure is very
high, and (3) the \emph{ST causal pathways} are complex due to the interactions
of multiple pollutants and the influence of environmental factors. Therefore,
we present \emph{p-Causality}, a novel pattern-aided causality analysis
approach that combines the strengths of \emph{pattern mining} and
\emph{Bayesian learning} to efficiently and faithfully identify the \emph{ST
causal pathways}. First, \emph{Pattern mining} helps suppress the noise by
capturing frequent evolving patterns (FEPs) of each monitoring sensor, and
greatly reduce the complexity by selecting the pattern-matched sensors as
"causers". Then, \emph{Bayesian learning} carefully encodes the local and ST
causal relations with a Gaussian Bayesian network (GBN)-based graphical model,
which also integrates environmental influences to minimize biases in the final
results. We evaluate our approach with three real-world data sets containing
982 air quality sensors, in three regions of China from 01-Jun-2013 to
19-Dec-2015. Results show that our approach outperforms the traditional causal
structure learning methods in time efficiency, inference accuracy and
interpretability.

    <title>The Statistical Face of a Region under Monsoon Rainfall in Eastern India</title>
    <summary>  A region under rainfall is a contiguous spatial area receiving positive
precipitation at a particular time. The probabilistic behavior of such a region
is an issue of interest in meteorological studies. A region under rainfall can
be viewed as a shape object of a special kind, where scale and rotational
invariance are not necessarily desirable attributes of a mathematical
representation. For modeling variation in objects of this type, we propose an
approximation of the boundary that can be represented as a real valued
function, and arrive at further approximation through functional principal
component analysis, after suitable adjustment for asymmetry and incompleteness
in the data. The analysis of an open access satellite data set on monsoon
precipitation over Eastern India leads to explanation of most of the variation
in shapes of the regions under rainfall through a handful of interpretable
functions that can be further approximated parametrically. The most important
aspect of shape is found to be the size followed by contraction/elongation,
mostly along two pairs of orthogonal axes. The different modes of variation are
remarkably stable across calendar years and across different thresholds for
minimum size of the region.

    <title>Variational integrators for anelastic and pseudo-incompressible flows</title>
    <summary>  The anelastic and pseudo-incompressible equations are two well-known
soundproof approximations of compressible flows useful for both theoretical and
numerical analysis in meteorology, atmospheric science, and ocean studies. In
this paper, we derive and test structure-preserving numerical schemes for these
two systems. The derivations are based on a discrete version of the
Euler-Poincar\'e variational method. This approach relies on a finite
dimensional approximation of the (Lie) group of diffeomorphisms that preserve
{\em weighted-}volume forms. These weights describe the background
stratification of the fluid and correspond to the weighed velocity fields for
anelasic and pseudo-incompressible approximations. In particular, we identify
to these discrete Lie group configurations the associated Lie algebras such
that elements of the latter correspond to weighted velocity fields that satisfy
the divergence-free conditions for both systems. Defining discrete Lagrangians
in terms of these Lie algebras, the discrete equations follow by means of
variational principles. We verify the structure-preserving nature of the
resulting variational integrators applying two test cases. The spectra of
internal gravity waves, emitted by a hydrostatic adjustment process, perfectly
reflects the models' dispersion relations. And, shape and advection speed of a
rising and a falling bubble match very well reference results in literature.
Descending from variational principles, the schemes exhibit further a discrete
version of Kelvin circulation theorem, are applicable to irregular meshes, and
show excellent long term energy behavior.

    <title>Partial wavelet coherence analysis for understanding the standalone
  relationship between Indian Precipitation and Teleconnection patterns</title>
    <summary>  Hydro-meteorological variables, like precipitation, streamflow are
significantly influenced by various climatic factors and large-scale
atmospheric circulation patterns. Efficient water resources management requires
an understanding of the effects of climate indices on the accurate
predictability of precipitation. This study aims at understanding the
standalone teleconnection between precipitation across India and the four
climate indices, namely, Ni\~no 3.4, PDO, SOI, and IOD using partial wavelet
analysis. The analysis considers the cross correlation between the climate
indices while estimating the relationship with precipitation. Previous studies
have overlooked the interdependence between these climate indices while
analysing their effect on precipitation. The results of the study reveal that
precipitation is only affected by Ni\~no 3.4 and IOD and a non-stationary
relationship exists between precipitation and these two climate indices.
Further, partial wavelet analysis revealed that SOI and PDO do not
significantly affect precipitation, but seems the other way because of their
interdependence on Ni\~no 3.4. It was observed that partial wavelet analysis
strongly revealed the standalone relationship of climatic factors with
precipitation after eliminating other potential factors. Keywords: Indian
Precipitation, wavelet coherency, partial wavelet coherence, teleconnections
patterns.

    <title>Global solvability of the rotating Navier-Stokes equations with
  fractional Laplacian in a periodic domain</title>
    <summary>  We consider existence of global solutions to equations for three-dimensional
rotating fluids in a periodic frame provided by a sufficiently large Coriolis
force. The Coriolis force appears in almost all of the models of meteorology
and geophysics dealing with large-scale phenomena. In the spatially decaying
case, Koh, Lee and Takada (2014) showed existence for the large times of
solutions of the rotating Euler equations provided by the large Coriolis force.
In this case the resonant equation does not appear anymore. In the periodic
case, however, the resonant equation appears, and thus the main subject in this
case is to show existence of global solutions to the resonant equation.
Research in this direction was initiated by Babin, Mahalov and Nicolaenko
(1999) who treated the rotating Navier-Stokes equations on general periodic
domains. On the other hand, Golse, Mahalov and Nicolaenko (2008) considered
bursting dynamics of the resonant equation in the case of a cylinder with no
viscosity. Thus we may not expect to show global existence of solutions to the
resonant equation without viscosity in the periodic case. In this paper we show
existence of global solutions for fractional Laplacian case (with its power
strictly less than the usual Laplacian) in the periodic domain with the same
period in each direction. The main ingredient is an improved estimate on
resonant three-wave interactions, which is based on a combinatorial argument.

    <title>Distributions-oriented wind forecast verification by a hidden Markov
  model for multivariate circular-linear data</title>
    <summary>  Winds from the North-West quadrant and lack of precipitation are known to
lead to an increase of PM10 concentrations over a residential neighborhood in
the city of Taranto (Italy). In 2012 the local government prescribed a
reduction of industrial emissions by 10% every time such meteorological
conditions are forecasted 72 hours in advance. Wind forecasting is addressed
using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric simulation system
by the Regional Environmental Protection Agency. In the context of
distributions-oriented forecast verification, we propose a comprehensive
model-based inferential approach to investigate the ability of the WRF system
to forecast the local wind speed and direction allowing different performances
for unknown weather regimes. Ground-observed and WRF-forecasted wind speed and
direction at a relevant location are jointly modeled as a 4-dimensional time
series with an unknown finite number of states characterized by homogeneous
distributional behavior. The proposed model relies on a mixture of joint
projected and skew normal distributions with time-dependent states, where the
temporal evolution of the state membership follows a first order Markov
process. Parameter estimates, including the number of states, are obtained by a
Bayesian MCMC-based method. Results provide useful insights on the performance
of WRF forecasts in relation to different combinations of wind speed and
direction.

    <title>Tensor Graphical Lasso (TeraLasso)</title>
    <summary>  The Bigraphical Lasso estimator was proposed to parsimoniously model the
precision matrices of matrix-normal data based on the Cartesian product of
graphs. By enforcing extreme sparsity (the number of parameters) and explicit
structures on the precision matrix, this model has excellent potential for
improving scalability of the computation and interpretability of complex data
analysis. As a result, this model significantly reduces the size of the sample
in order to learn the precision matrices, and hence the conditional probability
models along different coordinates such as space, time and replicates. In this
work, we extend the Bigraphical Lasso (BiGLasso) estimator to the TEnsor
gRAphical Lasso (TeraLasso) estimator and propose an analogous method for
modeling the precision matrix of tensor-valued data. We establish consistency
for both the BiGLasso and TeraLasso estimators and obtain the rates of
convergence in the operator and Frobenius norm for estimating the precision
matrix. We design a scalable gradient descent method for solving the objective
function and analyze the computational convergence rate, showing that the
composite gradient descent algorithm is guaranteed to converge at a geometric
rate to the global minimizer. Finally, we provide simulation evidence and
analysis of a meteorological dataset, showing that we can recover graphical
structures and estimate the precision matrices, as predicted by theory.

    <title>Modelling the descent of nitric oxide during the elevated stratopause
  event of January 2013</title>
    <summary>  Using simulations with a whole-atmosphere chemistry-climate model nudged by
meteorological analyses, global satellite observations of nitrogen oxide (NO)
and water vapour by the Sub-Millimetre Radiometer instrument (SMR), of
temperature by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), as well as local radar
observations, this study examines the recent major stratospheric sudden warming
accompanied by an elevated stratopause event (ESE) that occurred in January
2013. We examine dynamical processes during the ESE, including the role of
planetary wave, gravity wave and tidal forcing on the initiation of the descent
in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) and its continuation throughout the
mesosphere and stratosphere, as well as the impact of model eddy diffusion. We
analyse the transport of NO and find the model underestimates the large descent
of NO compared to SMR observations. We demonstrate that the discrepancy arises
abruptly in the MLT region at a time when the resolved wave forcing and the
planetary wave activity increase, just before the elevated stratopause reforms.
The discrepancy persists despite doubling the model eddy diffusion. While the
simulations reproduce an enhancement of the semi-diurnal tide following the
onset of the 2013 SSW, corroborating new meteor radar observations at high
northern latitudes over Trondheim (63.4$^{\circ}$N), the modelled tidal
contribution to the forcing of the mean meridional circulation and to the
descent is a small portion of the resolved wave forcing, and lags it by about
ten days.

    <title>Improved Very-short-term Wind Forecasting using Atmospheric
  Classification</title>
    <summary>  We present a regime-switching vector-autoregressive method for
very-short-term wind speed forecasting at multiple locations with regimes based
on large-scale meteorological phenomena. Statistical methods short-term wind
forecasting out-perform numerical weather prediction for forecast horizons up
to a few hours, and the spatio-temporal interdependency between geographically
dispersed locations may be exploited to improve forecast skill. Here we show
that conditioning spatio-temporal interdependency on `atmospheric modes' can
further improve forecast performance. The modes are defined from the
atmospheric classification of wind and pressure fields at the surface level,
and the geopotential height field at the 500hPa level. The data fields are
extracted from the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset with an hourly temporal
resolution over the UK, atmospheric patterns are classified using
self-organising maps and then clustered to optimise forecast performance. In a
case study based on 6 years of measurements from 23 weather stations in the UK,
a set of three atmospheric modes are found to be optimal for forecast
performance. The skill in the one- to six-hour-ahead forecasts is improved at
all sites compared to persistence and competitive benchmarks. Across the 23
test sites, one-hour-ahead root mean squared error is reduced by between 0.3%
and 4.1% compared to the best performing benchmark, and by and average of 1.6%
over all sites; the six-hour-ahead accuracy is improved by an average of 3.1%.

    <title>Spontaneous emergence of rogue waves in partially coherent waves: a
  quantitative experimental comparison between hydrodynamics and optics</title>
    <summary>  Rogue waves are extreme and rare fluctuations of the wave field that have
been discussed in many physical systems. Their presence substantially
influences the statistical properties of an incoherent wave field. Their
understanding is fundamental for the design of ships and offshore platforms.
Except for very particular meteorological conditions, waves in the ocean are
characterised by the so-called JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) spectrum.
Here we compare two unique experimental results: the first one has been
performed in a 270-meter wave tank and the other in optical fibers. In both
cases, waves characterised by a JONSWAP spectrum and random Fourier phases have
been launched at the input of the experimental device. The quantitative
comparison, based on an appropriate scaling of the two experiments, shows a
very good agreement between the statistics in hydrodynamics and optics.
Spontaneous emergence of heavy tails in the probability density function of the
wave amplitude is observed in both systems. The results demonstrate the
universal features of rogue waves and provide a fundamental and explicit bridge
between two important fields of research. Numerical simulations are also
compared with experimental results.

    <title>Sunflower yield and oil quality interactions and variability: analysis
  through a simple simulation model</title>
    <summary>  Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) grain and oil quality are defined by grain
weight and oil percentage, oil fatty acid composition and the amount of
antioxidants. The aim of this work was to establish and validate a simple
model, based on published relationships, which can estimate not only yield and
its components, but also grain and oil quality aspects which are of relevance
for industrial processes or human health. The model we developed provided good
estimations of grain yield (similar to those of a more complex model) and oil
quality from independent experiments. It explained known differences in
potential yield and grain and oil quality between locations, in terms of
differences in incident radiation, mean or minimum temperature. Simulations
showed that recent climatic changes could have caused a decrease in sunflower
yield and changes in oil quality. Our results suggest that at locations at
lower latitudes, sunflower oil with high nutritious value and oxidative
stability could compensate for relatively low yields, while at higher
latitudes, high-linoleic acid oil production should be compatible with high
yield potentials. Our model could facilitate the selection of the best
location, sowing date or density for the production of sunflower oil with
specific quality characteristics.

    <title>A 33-year NPP monitoring study in southwest China by the fusion of
  multi-source remote sensing and station data</title>
    <summary>  Knowledge of regional net primary productivity (NPP) is important for the
systematic understanding of the global carbon cycle. In this study,
multi-source data were employed to conduct a 33-year regional NPP study in
southwest China, at a 1-km scale. A multi-sensor fusion framework was applied
to obtain a new normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series from
1982 to 2014, combining the respective advantages of the different remote
sensing datasets. As another key parameter for NPP modeling, the total solar
radiation was calculated by the improved Yang hybrid model (YHM), using
meteorological station data. The verification described in this paper proved
the feasibility of all the applied data processes, and a greatly improved
accuracy was obtained for the NPP calculated with the final processed NDVI. The
spatio-temporal analysis results indicated that 68.07% of the study area showed
an increasing NPP trend over the past three decades. Significant heterogeneity
was found in the correlation between NPP and precipitation at a monthly scale,
specifically, the negative correlation in the growing season and the positive
correlation in the dry season. The lagged positive correlation in the growing
season and no lag in the dry season indicated the important impact of
precipitation on NPP.

    <title>A probabilistic scheme for joint parameter estimation and state
  prediction in complex dynamical systems</title>
    <summary>  Many problems in the geophysical sciences demand the ability to calibrate the
parameters and predict the time evolution of complex dynamical models using
sequentially-collected data. Here we introduce a general methodology for the
joint estimation of the static parameters and the forecasting of the state
variables of nonlinear, and possibly chaotic, dynamical models. The proposed
scheme is essentially probabilistic. It aims at recursively computing the
sequence of joint posterior probability distributions of the unknown model
parameters and its (time varying) state variables conditional on the available
observations. The latter are possibly partial and contaminated by noise. The
new framework combines a Monte Carlo scheme to approximate the posterior
distribution of the fixed parameters with filtering (or {\em data
assimilation}) techniques to track and predict the distribution of the state
variables. For this reason, we refer to the proposed methodology as {\em nested
filtering}. In this paper we specifically explore the use of Gaussian filtering
methods, but other approaches fit naturally within the new framework. As an
illustrative example, we apply three different implementations of the
methodology to the tracking of the state, and the estimation of the fixed
parameters, of a stochastic two-scale Lorenz 96 system. This model is commonly
used to assess data assimilation procedures in meteorology. For this example,
we compare different nested filters and show estimation and forecasting results
for a 4,000-dimensional system.

    <title>Existence of inelastic supernumerary nuclear rainbow in
  $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C scattering</title>
    <summary>  The existence of a supernumerary nuclear rainbow in inelastic scattering is
reported. This is done by studying inelastic $^{16}$O scattering from $^{12}$C,
exciting the $2^+$ (4.44 MeV) state of $^{12}$C and elastic scattering at the
incident energies in the range 124 to 200 MeV, using the coupled channels
method. An extended double folding potential is used. This is derived from
realistic wave functions for $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O calculated with a
microscopic $\alpha$ cluster model and a finite-range density-dependent
nucleon-nucleon force. Excitations to the $2^+$ (4.44 MeV), 3$^-$ (9.64 MeV)
and $4^+$ (14.08 MeV) states of $^{12}$C, and the $3^-$ (6.13 MeV) and $2^+$
(6.92 MeV) states of $^{16}$O are included in the coupled channels
calculations. The emergence of the supernumerary bow is understood by the
properties of both the Luneburg-lens-like potential in the internal region and
diffuse attraction in the outer region. The existence of a supernumerary
rainbow for inelastic scattering in addition to the existence of a dynamically
created secondary rainbow and a dynamically refracted primary rainbow for
elastic scattering, which are not observed in meteorological rainbows, further
deepens the understanding of nuclear rainbows.

    <title>An objective classification of Saturn cloud features from Cassini ISS
  images</title>
    <summary>  A clustering algorithm is applied to Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem
continuum and methane band images of Saturns northern hemisphere to objectively
classify regional albedo features and aid in their dynamical interpretation.
The procedure is based on a technique applied previously to visible-infrared
images of Earth. It provides a new perspective on giant planet cloud morphology
and its relationship to the dynamics and a meteorological context for the
analysis of other types of simultaneous Saturn observations. The method
identifies six clusters that exhibit distinct morphology, vertical structure,
and preferred latitudes of occurrence. These correspond to areas dominated by
deep convective cells; low contrast areas, some including thinner and thicker
clouds possibly associated with baroclinic instability; regions with possible
isolated thin cirrus clouds; darker areas due to thinner low level clouds or
clearer skies due to downwelling, or due to absorbing particles; and fields of
relatively shallow cumulus clouds. The spatial associations among these cloud
types suggest that dynamically, there are three distinct types of latitude
bands on Saturn: deep convectively disturbed latitudes in cyclonic shear
regions poleward of the eastward jets; convectively suppressed regions near and
surrounding the westward jets; and baroclinically unstable latitudes near
eastward jet cores and in the anti-cyclonic regions equatorward of them. These
are roughly analogous to some of the features of Earths tropics, subtropics,
and midlatitudes, respectively. Temporal variations of feature contrast and
cluster occurrence suggest that the upper tropospheric haze in the northern
hemisphere may have thickened by 2014.

    <title>Constrained Factor Models for High-Dimensional Matrix-Variate Time
  Series</title>
    <summary>  High-dimensional matrix-variate time series data are becoming widely
available in many scientific fields, such as economics, biology, and
meteorology. To achieve significant dimension reduction while preserving the
intrinsic matrix structure and temporal dynamics in such data, Wang et al.
(2017) proposed a matrix factor model that is shown to provide effective
analysis. In this paper, we establish a general framework for incorporating
domain or prior knowledge in the matrix factor model through linear
constraints. The proposed framework is shown to be useful in achieving
parsimonious parameterization, facilitating interpretation of the latent matrix
factor, and identifying specific factors of interest. Fully utilizing the
prior-knowledge-induced constraints results in more efficient and accurate
modeling, inference, dimension reduction as well as a clear and better
interpretation of the results. In this paper, constrained, multi-term, and
partially constrained factor models for matrix-variate time series are
developed, with efficient estimation procedures and their asymptotic
properties. We show that the convergence rates of the constrained factor
loading matrices are much faster than those of the conventional matrix factor
analysis under many situations. Simulation studies are carried out to
demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method and its
associated asymptotic properties. We illustrate the proposed model with three
applications, where the constrained matrix-factor models outperform their
unconstrained counterparts in the power of variance explanation under the
out-of-sample 10-fold cross-validation setting.

    <title>Estimation of time-space-varying parameters in dengue epidemic models</title>
    <summary>  There are nowadays a huge load of publications about dengue epidemic models,
which mostly employ deterministic differential equations. The analytical
properties of deterministic models are always of particular interest by many
experts, but their validity - if they can indeed track some empirical data - is
an increasing demand by many practitioners. In this view, the data can tell to
which figure the solutions yielded from the models should be; they drift all
the involving parameters towards the most appropriate values. By prior
understanding of the population dynamics, some parameters with inherently
constant values can be estimated forthwith; some others can sensibly be
guessed. However, solutions from such models using sets of constant parameters
most likely exhibit, if not smoothness, at least noise-free behavior; whereas
the data appear very random in nature. Therefore, some parameters cannot be
constant as the solutions to seemingly appear in a high correlation with the
data. We were aware of impracticality to solve a deterministic model many times
that exhaust all trials of the parameters, or to run its stochastic version
with Monte Carlo strategy that also appeals for a high number of solving
processes. We were also aware that those aforementioned non-constant parameters
can potentially have particular relationships with several extrinsic factors,
such as meteorology and socioeconomics of the human population. We then study
an estimation of time-space-varying parameters within the framework of
variational calculus and investigate how some parameters are related to some
extrinsic factors. Numerical results for some examples with real data are shown
and discussed in details.

    <title>Bayesian prior elicitation and selection for extreme values</title>
    <summary>  A major issue of extreme value analysis is the determination of the shape
parameter $\xi$ common to Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Generalized
Pareto (GP) distributions, which drives the tail behavior, and is of major
impact on the estimation of return levels and periods. Many practitioners make
the choice of a Bayesian framework to conduct this assessment for accounting of
parametric uncertainties, which are typically high in such analyses
characterized by a low number of observations. Nonetheless, such approaches can
provide large credibility domains for $\xi$, including negative and positive
values, which does not allow to conclude on the nature of the tail. Considering
the block maxima framework, a generic approach of the determination of the
value and sign of $\xi$ arises from model selection between the Fr\'echet,
Gumbel and Weibull possible domains of attraction conditionally to
observations. Opposite to the common choice of the GEV as an appropriate model
for {\it sampling} extreme values, this model selection must be conducted with
great care. The elicitation of proper, informative and easy-to use priors is
conducted based on the following principle: for all parameter dimensions they
act as posteriors of noninformative priors and virtual samples. Statistics of
these virtual samples can be assessed from prior predictive information, and a
compatibility rule can be carried out to complete the calibration, even though
they are only semi-conjugated. Besides, the model selection is conducted using
a mixture encompassing framework, which allows to tackle the computation of
Bayes factors. Motivating by a real case-study involving the elicitation of
expert knowledge on meteorological magnitudes, the overall methodology is
illustrated by toy examples too.

    <title>Minimax Estimation of Large Precision Matrices with Bandable Cholesky
  Factor</title>
    <summary>  Last decade witnesses significant methodological and theoretical advances in
estimating large precision matrices. In particular, there are scientific
applications such as longitudinal data, meteorology and spectroscopy in which
the ordering of the variables can be interpreted through a bandable structure
on the Cholesky factor of the precision matrix. However, the minimax theory has
still been largely unknown, as opposed to the well established minimax results
over the corresponding bandable covariance matrices. In this paper, we focus on
two commonly used types of parameter spaces, and develop the optimal rates of
convergence under both the operator norm and the Frobenius norm. A striking
phenomenon is found: two types of parameter spaces are fundamentally different
under the operator norm but enjoy the same rate optimality under the Frobenius
norm, which is in sharp contrast to the equivalence of corresponding two types
of bandable covariance matrices under both norms. This fundamental difference
is established by carefully constructing the corresponding minimax lower
bounds. Two new estimation procedures are developed: for the operator norm, our
optimal procedure is based on a novel local cropping estimator targeting on all
principle submatrices of the precision matrix while for the Frobenius norm, our
optimal procedure relies on a delicate regression-based block-thresholding
rule. We further establish rate optimality in the nonparanormal model.
Numerical studies are carried out to confirm our theoretical findings.

    <title>Raman Detection Threshold Measurements for Acetic Acid in Martian
  Regolith Simulant JSC-1 in the Presence of Hydrated Metallic Sulfates</title>
    <summary>  Several measurements, including the data from the laser spectrometer in the
Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite on the Curiosity Rover in Gale crater,
have measured seasonal variations in atmospheric methane at the 0.7 ppbv (parts
per billion volume) level. As a result, models have been proposed to understand
the methane production including novel chemical, geological, meteorological,
and biological mechanisms. Biological models often rely on methanogenic
extremophile archaea which might be similar to some Earth based organisms which
can be studied exhaustively in a laboratory setting. Such organisms might
thrive in a subsurface ecosystem involving water and methane and as such could
leave a unique biosignature in the Martian regolith that could be preserved
over extended periods of time. The resulting mixture of carboxyl, acetyl and
hydroxyl groups blended with the metallic sulfates and regolith constituents
could produce a Raman signature detectable on the next rover mission if the
concentration is high enough. Here we measure the 532 nm and the 780 nm Raman
spectra of a variety of molar concentrations of several hydrated metallic
sulfates mixed with JSC-1 Martian regolith simulant to identify the signature
concentration thresholds for the isolated C=O Raman peak from acetic acid. We
find a Raman peak removed from most fragmented molecular Raman bands near 1608
cm-1 using the 532 nm laser for the Fe and Mg sulfates to yield a threshold in
the 120 - 160 ppmv range for a cutoff S/N of 2.

    <title>A Learning Based Approach for Uncertainty Analysis in Numerical Weather
  Prediction Models</title>
    <summary>  Complex numerical weather prediction models incorporate a variety of physical
processes, each described by multiple alternative physical schemes with
specific parameters. The selection of the physical schemes and the choice of
the corresponding physical parameters during model configuration can
significantly impact the accuracy of model forecasts. There is no combination
of physical schemes that works best for all times, at all locations, and under
all conditions. It is therefore of considerable interest to understand the
interplay between the choice of physics and the accuracy of the resulting
forecasts under different conditions. This paper demonstrates the use of
machine learning techniques to study the uncertainty in numerical weather
prediction models due to the interaction of multiple physical processes. The
first problem addressed herein is the estimation of systematic model errors in
output quantities of interest at future times, and the use of this information
to improve the model forecasts. The second problem considered is the
identification of those specific physical processes that contribute most to the
forecast uncertainty in the quantity of interest under specified meteorological
conditions.
  The discrepancies between model results and observations at past times are
used to learn the relationships between the choice of physical processes and
the resulting forecast errors. Numerical experiments are carried out with the
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The output quantity of interest
is the model precipitation, a variable that is both extremely important and
very challenging to forecast. The physical processes under consideration
include various micro-physics schemes, cumulus parameterizations, short wave,
and long wave radiation schemes. The experiments demonstrate the strong
potential of machine learning approaches to aid the study of model errors.

    <title>Evidence for Filamentarity in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey</title>
    <summary>  We apply Shapefinders, statistical measures of `shape' constructed from two
dimensional partial Minkowski functionals, to study the degree of filamentarity
in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). In two dimensions, three Minkowski
functionals characterise the morphology of an object, they are: its perimeter
(L), area (S), and genus. Out of L and S a single dimensionless Shapefinder
Statistic, F can be constructed (0 &lt;=F &lt;=1). F acquires extreme values on a
circle (F = 0) and a filament (F = 1). Using F, we quantify the extent of
filamentarity in the LCRS by comparing our results with a Poisson distribution
with similar geometrical properties and having the same selection function as
the survey. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that the LCRS displays a high
degree of filamentarity both in the Northern and Southern galactic sections a
result that is in general agreement with the visual appearance of the
catalogue. It is well known that gravitational clustering from Gaussian initial
conditions gives rise to the development of non-Gaussianity reflected in the
formation of a network-like filamentary structure on supercluster scales.
Consequently the fact that the smoothed LCRS catalogue shows properties
consistent with those of a Gaussian random field (Colley 1997) whereas the
unsmoothed catalogue demonstrates the presence of filamentarity lends strong
support to the conjecture that the large scale clustering of galaxies is driven
by gravitational instability.

    <title>Estimating the Fractal Dimension, K_2-entropy, and the Predictability of
  the Atmosphere</title>
    <summary>  The series of mean daily temperature of air recorded over a period of 215
years is used for analysing the dimensionality and the predictability of the
atmospheric system. The total number of data points of the series is 78527.
Other 37 versions of the original series are generated, including ``seasonally
adjusted'' data, a smoothed series, series without annual course, etc. Modified
methods of Grassberger and Procaccia are applied. A procedure for selection of
the ``meaningful'' scaling region is proposed. Several scaling regions are
revealed in the ln C(r) versus ln r diagram. The first one in the range of
larger ln r has a gradual slope and the second one in the range of intermediate
ln r has a fast slope. Other two regions are settled in the range of small ln
r. The results lead us to claim that the series arises from the activity of at
least two subsystems. The first subsystem is low-dimensional (d_f=1.6) and it
possesses the potential predictability of several weeks. We suggest that this
subsystem is connected with seasonal variability of weather. The second
subsystem is high-dimensional (d_f&gt;17) and its error-doubling time is about 4-7
days. It is found that the predictability differs in dependence on season. The
predictability time for summer, winter and the entire year (T_2 approx. 4.7
days) is longer than for transition-seasons (T_2 approx. 4.0 days for spring,
T_2 approx. 3.6 days for autumn). The role of random noise and the number of
data points are discussed. It is shown that a 15-year-long daily temperature
series is not sufficient for reliable estimations based on Grassberger and
Procaccia algorithms.

    <title>Evaluating the quality of ground-based microwave radiometer measurements
  and retrievals using detrended fluctuation and spectral analysis methods</title>
    <summary>  Time series both of microwave radiometer brightness temperature measurements
at 23.8 and 31.4 GHz and of retrievals of water vapor and liquid water path
from these brightness temperatures are evaluated using the detrended
fluctuation analysis method. As quantified by the parameter $\alpha$, this
method (i) enables identification of the time scales over which noise dominates
the time series and (ii) characterizes the temporal range of correlations in
the time series. The more common spectral analysis method is also used to
assess the data and its results are compared with those from detrended
fluctuation analysis method. The assumption that measurements should have
certain scaling properties allows the quality of the measurements to be
characterized. The additional assumption that the scaling properties of the
measurements of an atmospheric quantity are preserved in a useful retrieval
provides a means for evaluating the retrieval itself. Applying these two
assumptions to microwave radiometer measurements and retrievals demonstrates
three points. First, the retrieved water vapor path during cloudy-sky periods
can be dominated by noise on shorter than ~30~min time scales
($\alpha$-exponent = 0.1) and exhibits no scaling behavior at longer time
scales. However, correlations in the brightness temperatures and liquid water
path retrievals are found to be consistent with a power-law behavior for time
scales up to 3 hr with an $\alpha$-exponent equal to approximately 0.3, as in
other geophysical phenomena. Second, clear-sky, moist atmospheres show the
expected scaling for both measurements and retrievals of the water vapor path.
Third, during clear-sky, dry atmospheric days, instrument noise from the 31.4
GHz channel compromises the quality of the water vapor path retrieval.

    <title>Application of a Large Eddy Simulation Database to Optimization of First
  Order Closures for Neutral and Stably Stratified Boundary Layers</title>
    <summary>  Large-eddy simulation (LES) is a well-established numerical technique, which
resolves the most energetic turbulent fluctuations in the planetary boundary
layers. Averaging these fluctuations, high-quality profiles of mean values and
turbulence statistics can be obtained in experiments with well-defined initial
and boundary conditions. Hence, the LES data can be beneficial for assessment
and optimization of turbulence closure schemes. A database of 80 LES runs for
neutral and stably stratified PBLs (DATABASE64) is applied in this study to
optimize the first-order turbulence closure (FOC). Approximations for the
mixing length scale and stability correction functions have been tuned to
minimise a relative root-mean square error over the entire DATABASE64. New
stability functions have correct asymptotes describing regimes of strong and
week mixing found in theoretical exercises, atmospheric data and LES. The
correct asymptotes exclude the need for a critical Richardson number in the FOC
formulation. Further, we analysed the FOC quality as functions of the integral
PBL stability and the vertical model resolution. We show that the FOC is never
perfect because the turbulence in the upper half of the PBL is not generated by
the local gradients. Accordingly, the parameterized and LES fluxes decorrelate
in the upper PBL. With this imperfection in mind, we show that there is no
systematic quality deterioration of the FOC in strongly stable PBLs provided
the vertical model resolution is better than 10 levels within the PBL. In
agreement with previous studies, we found that the quality improves slowly with
the vertical resolution refinement. It is generally wise to not overstretch the
mesh in the lowest 500 m of the atmosphere where majority of the observed,
simulated and theoretically predicted stably stratified PBLs are located.

    <title>The climate version of the Eta regional forecast model. 1. Evaluation of
  consistency between the Eta model and HadAM3P global model</title>
    <summary>  The regional climate model prepared from Eta WS forecast model has been
integrated over South America with the horizontal resolution of 40 km for the
period of 1960-1990. The model was forced at its lateral boundaries by the
outputs of HadAM3P. The data of HadAM3P represent simulation of modern climate
with the resolution about 150 km. In order to prepare climate regional model
from the Eta forecast model multiple modifications and corrections were made in
the original model. The run of climate Eta model was made on the supercomputer
SX-6. The detailed analysis of the results of dynamical downscaling experiment
includes an investigation of a consistency between the regional and AGCM models
as well as of ability of the regional model to resolve important features of
climate fields on the finer scale than that resolved by AGCM. In this work the
results of the investigation of a consistency between the output fields of the
Eta model and HadAM3P are presented. The geopotential, temperature and wind
fields of both models were analysed. For the evaluation of the likeness of
these two models outputs,there were used Fourier analysis of time series,
consistency index, constituted from linear regression coefficients, time mean
and space mean models' arithmetic difference and root mean square difference,
dispersion analysis,and some others characteristics. This investigation
demonstrates that there are not significant differences in behaviour and
spatial arragement of large-scale structures of the two models. Also, the
regional model characteristics do not have considerable positive or negative
trend during integration time in relation to the global model characteristics.
  From the total analysis we can affirm that in the description of large-scale
climate structures these two models are in consistency.

    <title>Continuing dynamic assimilation of the inner region data in
  hydrodynamics modelling: Optimization approach</title>
    <summary>  In meteorological and oceanological studies the classical approach for
finding the numerical solution of the regional model consists in formulating
and solving the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem. The related boundary conditions are
obtained by linear interpolation of data available on a coarse grid (global
data), to the boundary of regional model. Errors, in boundary conditions,
appearing owing to linear interpolation may lead to increasing errors in
numerical solution during integration. The methods developed to reduce these
errors deal with continuous dynamic assimilation of known global data available
inside the regional domain. Essentially, this assimilation procedure performs a
nudging of large-scale component of regional model solution to large-scale
global data component by introducing the relaxation forcing terms into the
regional model equations. As a result, the obtained solution is not a valid
numerical solution of the original regional model. In this work we propose the
optimization approach which is free from the above-mentioned shortcoming. The
formulation of the joint problem of finding the regional model solution and
data assimilation, as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, gives the
possibility to obtain the exact numerical solution of the regional model. Three
simple model examples (ODE Burgers equation, Rossby-Oboukhov equation,
Korteweg-de Vries equation) were considered in this paper. The result of
performed numerical experiments indicates that the optimization approach can
significantly improve the precision of the sought numerical solution, even in
the cases in which the solution of Cauchy-Dirichlet problem is very sensitive
to the errors in the boundary condition.

    <title>Chandra and XMM Observations of the Composite Supernova Remnant
  G327.1-1.1</title>
    <summary>  We present new X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of a composite supernova
remnant G327.1-1.1 using the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories.
G327.1-1.1 has an unusual morphology consisting of a symmetric radio shell and
an off center nonthermal component that indicates the presence of a pulsar wind
nebula (PWN). Radio observations show a narrow finger of emission extending
from the PWN structure towards the northwest. X-ray studies with ASCA, ROSAT,
and BeppoSAX revealed elongated extended emission and a compact source at the
tip of the finger that may be coincident with the actual pulsar. The high
resolution Chandra observations provide new insight into the structure of the
inner region of the remnant. The images show a compact source embedded in a
cometary structure, from which a trail of X-ray emission extends in the
southeast direction. The Chandra images also reveal two prong-like structures
that appear to originate from the vicinity of the compact source and extend
into a large bubble that is oriented in the north-west direction, opposite from
the bright radio PWN. The emission from the entire radio shell is detected in
the XMM data and can be characterized by a thermal plasma model with a
temperature of 0.3 keV, which we use to estimate the physical properties of the
remnant. The peculiar morphology of G327.1-1.1 may be explained by the emission
from a moving pulsar and a relic PWN that has been disrupted by the reverse
shock.

    <title>Predictability of PV power grid performance on insular sites without
  weather stations: use of artificial neural networks</title>
    <summary>  The official meteorological network is poor on the island of Corsica: only
three sites being about 50 km apart are equipped with pyranometers which enable
measurements by hourly and daily step. These sites are Ajaccio (seaside),
Bastia (seaside) and Corte (average altitude of 486 meters). This lack of
weather station makes difficult the predictability of PV power grid
performance. This work intends to study a methodology which can predict global
solar irradiation using data available from another location for daily and
hourly horizon. In order to achieve this prediction, we have used Artificial
Neural Network which is a popular artificial intelligence technique in the
forecasting domain. A simulator has been obtained using data available for the
station of Ajaccio that is the only station for which we have a lot of data: 16
years from 1972 to 1987. Then we have tested the efficiency of this simulator
in two places with different geographical features: Corte, a mountainous region
and Bastia, a coastal region. On daily horizon, the relocation has implied
fewer errors than a naive prediction method based on the persistence (RMSE=1468
Vs 1383Wh/m2 to Bastia and 1325 Vs 1213Wh/m2 to Corte). On hourly case, the
results were still satisfactory, and widely better than persistence (RMSE=138.8
Vs 109.3 Wh/m2 to Bastia and 135.1 Vs 114.7 Wh/m2 to Corte). The last
experiment was to evaluate the accuracy of our simulator on a PV power grid
localized at 10 km from the station of Ajaccio. We got errors very suitable
(nRMSE=27.9%, RMSE=99.0 W.h) compared to those obtained with the persistence
(nRMSE=42.2%, RMSE=149.7 W.h).

    <title>Atmospheric Circulation of Exoplanets</title>
    <summary>  We survey the basic principles of atmospheric dynamics relevant to explaining
existing and future observations of exoplanets, both gas giant and terrestrial.
Given the paucity of data on exoplanet atmospheres, our approach is to
emphasize fundamental principles and insights gained from Solar-System studies
that are likely to be generalizable to exoplanets. We begin by presenting the
hierarchy of basic equations used in atmospheric dynamics, including the
Navier-Stokes, primitive, shallow-water, and two-dimensional nondivergent
models. We then survey key concepts in atmospheric dynamics, including the
importance of planetary rotation, the concept of balance, and scaling arguments
to show how turbulent interactions generally produce large-scale east-west
banding on rotating planets. We next turn to issues specific to giant planets,
including their expected interior and atmospheric thermal structures, the
implications for their wind patterns, and mechanisms to pump their east-west
jets. Hot Jupiter atmospheric dynamics are given particular attention, as these
close-in planets have been the subject of most of the concrete developments in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres. We then turn to the basic elements of
circulation on terrestrial planets as inferred from Solar-System studies,
including Hadley cells, jet streams, processes that govern the large-scale
horizontal temperature contrasts, and climate, and we discuss how these
insights may apply to terrestrial exoplanets. Although exoplanets surely
possess a greater diversity of circulation regimes than seen on the planets in
our Solar System, our guiding philosophy is that the multi-decade study of
Solar-System planets reviewed here provides a foundation upon which our
understanding of more exotic exoplanetary meteorology must build.

    <title>Site testing of the Sierra de Javalambre. First results</title>
    <summary>  We present the main characteristics of the proposed location for the
Javalambre Astrophysical Observatory. The measurements have been obtained from
spectrophotometric, photometric and seeing data obtained with different
monitors and instruments on the site and publicly accessible meteorological
satellite data.
  The night-sky optical spectrum observed in a moonless night shows very little
contamination by the typical pollution lines. Their contribution to the
sky-brightness is ~0.06 mag in B, ~0.09 mag in V and ~0.06 mag in R. In
particular, the comparison of the strengths of the Sodium artificial and
natural lines indicates that the site satisfies the IAU recommendations for a
dark site. The zenith-corrected values of the moonless night-sky surface
brightness are B = 22.8 mag arcsec^-2, V = 22.1 mag arcsec^-2, R = 21.5 mag
arcsec^-2, I = 20.4 mag arcsec^-2, which indicates that the site is very dark.
The extinction has been measured for the summer period, with a typical value of
0.22 mag in the V-Band, with the best measured value of 0.18 mag in a totally
photometric night. The median value of the seeing in the V-band for the last
two years (2008-9) is 0.71", with a mode of 0.58". The seeing values present a
seasonal pattern, being smaller in summer (~0.69") than in winter time (0.77").
For 68% of the analyzed nights the seeing was better than 0.8" during the
entire night. The seeing is found to be stable for rather long periods, in
particular for the nights with good seeing values. The typical scale, for
nights with the seeing below 0.8", is about 5 hours for variations within 20%
of the reference value. The fraction of totally clear nights is ~53%, while the
fraction of nights with at least a 30% of the night clear is ~74%.

    <title>Meso-Nh simulations of the atmospheric flow above the Internal Antarctic
  Plateau</title>
    <summary>  Mesoscale model such as Meso-Nh have proven to be highly reliable in
reproducing 3D maps of optical turbulence (see Refs. 1, 2, 3, 4) above
mid-latitude astronomical sites. These last years ground-based astronomy has
been looking towards Antarctica. Especially its summits and the Internal
Continental Plateau where the optical turbulence appears to be confined in a
shallow layer close to the icy surface. Preliminary measurements have so far
indicated pretty good value for the seeing above 30-35 m: 0.36" (see Ref. 5)
and 0.27" (see Refs. 6, 7) at Dome C. Site testing campaigns are however
extremely expensive, instruments provide only local measurements and
atmospheric modelling might represent a step ahead towards the search and
selection of astronomical sites thanks to the possibility to reconstruct 3D Cn2
maps over a surface of several kilometers. The Antarctic Plateau represents
therefore an important benchmark test to evaluate the possibility to
discriminate sites on the same plateau. Our group8 has proven that the analyses
from the ECMWF global model do not describe with the required accuracy the
antarctic boundary and surface layer in the plateau. A better description could
be obtained with a mesoscale meteorological model. In this contribution we
present the progress status report of numerical simulations (including the
optical turbulence - Cn2) obtained with Meso-Nh above the internal Antarctic
Plateau. Among the topic attacked: the influence of different configurations of
the model (low and high horizontal resolution), use of the grid-nesting
interactive technique, forecasting of the optical turbulence during some winter
nights.

    <title>Mesoscale optical turbulence simulations at Dome C: refinements</title>
    <summary>  In a recent paper the authors presented an extended study aiming at
simulating the classical meteorological parameters and the optical turbulence
at Dome C during the winter with the atmospherical mesoscale model Meso-NH. A
statistical analysis has been presented and the conclusions of that paper have
been very promising. Wind speed and temperature fields revealed to be very well
reconstructed by the Meso-NH model with better performances than what has been
achieved with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF)
global model, especially near the surface. All results revealed to be
resolution-dependent and it has been proved that a grid-nesting configuration
(3 domains) with a high horizontal resolution (1km) for the innermost domain is
necessary to reconstruct all the optical turbulence features with a good
correlation to measurements. High resolution simulations provided an averaged
surface layer thickness just ~14 m higher than what is estimated by
measurements, the seeing in the free atmosphere showed a dispersion from the
observed one of just a few hundredths of an arcsecond (~0.05"). The unique
limitation of the previous study was that the optical turbulence in the surface
layer appeared overestimated by the model in both low and high resolution
modes. In this study we present the results obtained with an improved numerical
configuration. The same 15 nights have been simulated, and we show that the
model results now match almost perfectly the observations in all their
features: the surface thickness, the seeing in the free atmosphere as well as
in the surface layer. This result permits us to investigate now other antarctic
sites using a robust numerical model well adapted to the extreme polar
conditions (Meso-NH).

    <title>Predictability of PV power grid performance on insular sites without
  weather stations: use of artificial neural networks</title>
    <summary>  The official meteorological network is poor on the island of Corsica: only
three sites being about 50 km apart are equipped with pyranometers which enable
measurements by hourly and daily step. These sites are Ajaccio (41\degree 55'N
and 8\degree 48'E, seaside), Bastia (42\degree 33'N, 9\degree 29'E, seaside)
and Corte (42\degree 30'N, 9\degree 15'E average altitude of 486 meters). This
lack of weather station makes difficult the predictability of PV power grid
performance. This work intends to study a methodology which can predict global
solar irradiation using data available from another location for daily and
hourly horizon. In order to achieve this prediction, we have used Artificial
Neural Network which is a popular artificial intelligence technique in the
forecasting domain. A simulator has been obtained using data available for the
station of Ajaccio that is the only station for which we have a lot of data: 16
years from 1972 to 1987. Then we have tested the efficiency of this simulator
in two places with different geographical features: Corte, a mountainous region
and Bastia, a coastal region. On daily horizon, the relocation has implied
fewer errors than a "na\"ive" prediction method based on the persistence
(RMSE=1468 Vs 1383Wh/m^2 to Bastia and 1325 Vs 1213Wh/m^2 to Corte). On hourly
case, the results were still satisfactory, and widely better than persistence
(RMSE=138.8 Vs 109.3 Wh/m^2 to Bastia and 135.1 Vs 114.7 Wh/m^2 to Corte). The
last experiment was to evaluate the accuracy of our simulator on a PV power
grid localized at 10 km from the station of Ajaccio. We got errors very
suitable (nRMSE=27.9%, RMSE=99.0 W.h) compared to those obtained with the
persistence (nRMSE=42.2%, RMSE=149.7 W.h).

    <title>Atmospheric circulation of tidally locked exoplanets: a suite of
  benchmark tests for dynamical solvers</title>
    <summary>  The complexity of atmospheric modelling and its inherent non-linearity,
together with the limited amount of data of exoplanets available, motivate
model intercomparisons and benchmark tests. In the geophysical community, the
Held-Suarez test is a standard benchmark for comparing dynamical core
simulations of the Earth's atmosphere with different solvers, based on
statistically-averaged flow quantities. In the present study, we perform
analogues of the Held-Suarez test for tidally-locked exoplanets with the
GFDL-Princeton Flexible Modeling System (FMS) by subjecting both the spectral
and finite difference dynamical cores to a suite of tests, including the
standard benchmark for Earth, a hypothetical tidally-locked Earth, a "shallow"
hot Jupiter model and a "deep" model of HD 209458b. We find qualitative and
quantitative agreement between the solvers for the Earth, tidally-locked Earth
and shallow hot Jupiter benchmarks, but the agreement is less than satisfactory
for the deep model of HD 209458b. Further investigation reveals that closer
agreement may be attained by arbitrarily adjusting the values of the horizontal
dissipation parameters in the two solvers, but it remains the case that the
magnitude of the horizontal dissipation is not easily specified from first
principles. Irrespective of radiative transfer or chemical composition
considerations, our study points to limitations in our ability to accurately
model hot Jupiter atmospheres with meteorological solvers at the level of ten
percent for the temperature field and several tens of percent for the velocity
field. Direct wind measurements should thus be particularly constraining for
the models. Our suite of benchmark tests also provides a reference point for
researchers wishing to adapt their codes to study the atmospheric circulation
regimes of tidally-locked Earths/Neptunes/Jupiters.

    <title>The Determination of the Water Vapor Content in the Pulkovo VKM-100
  Multipass Vacuum Cell Using Polymer Sensors of Humidity</title>
    <summary>  In spectral studies of water vapor under laboratory conditions (determination
of molecular constants, measurement for spectral transmission functions), the
amount of water vapor in the time of the measurements is one of the most
essential parameters, which should be determined accurately. We discuss the
application for this purpose of polymer sensors of humidity manufactured by
Praktik-NC (Moscow) and used in the Pulkovo VKM-100 multipass vacuum cell.
These sensors were examined in the laboratory of Lindenberg Meteorological
observatory (Germany) by comparison between their readings and those of
standard measuring devices for various values of relative humidity, pressure,
and temperature. We also carried out measurements of relative humidity in boxes
with saline solution, in which the relative humidity that corresponds to a
given solution is guaranteed with the accuracy of several tenths of percent.
The analysis of the results of the laboratory examination of the sensors and
extended sets of measurements made with the Pulkovo cell made it possible to
conclude that in measurements in the interval of relative humidity 40-80%, the
~5% accuracy of the measurements for the water vapor content is reached.
Further paths are indicated for the increase of the accuracy of measurements
and extending the interval of the relative humidity, in which accurate
measurements may be carried out.

    <title>Analysis of the application of the optical method to the measurements of
  the water vapor content in the atmosphere - Part 1: Basic concepts of the
  measurement technique</title>
    <summary>  We retrieved the total content of the atmospheric water vapor (or Integrated
Water Vapor, IWV) from extensive sets of photometric data obtained since 1995
at Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory with star and sun photometers.
Different methods of determination of the empirical parameters that are
necessary for the retrieval are discussed. The instruments were independently
calibrated using laboratory measurements made at Pulkovo Observatory with the
VKM-100 multi-pass vacuum cell. The empirical parameters were also calculated
by the simulation of the atmospheric absorption by water vapor, using the
MODRAN-4 program package for different model atmospheres. The results are
compared to those presented in the literature, obtained with different
instruments and methods of the retrieval. The reliability of the empirical
parameters, used for the power approximation that links the water vapor content
with the observed absorption, is analyzed. Currently, the total (from
measurements, calibration, and calculations) errors yield the standard
uncertainty of about 10% in the total column water vapor. We discuss the
possibilities for improving the accuracy of calibration to ~1% as indispensable
condition in order to make it possible to use data obtained by optical
photometry as an independent reference for other methods (GPS, MW-radiometers,
lidar, etc).

    <title>Optical atmospheric extinction over Cerro Paranal</title>
    <summary>  Aims: The present study was conducted to determine the optical extinction
curve for Cerro Paranal under typical clear-sky observing conditions, with an
accuracy of 0.01 mag/airmass. Methods: The extinction curve of Paranal was
obtained through low-resolution spectroscopy of 8 spectrophotometric standard
stars observed with FORS1 mounted at the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope, covering a
spectral range 3300-8000 A. A total of 600 spectra were collected on more than
40 nights distributed over six months, from October 2008 to March 2009. The
average extinction curve was derived using a global fit algorithm, which
allowed us to simultaneously combine all the available data. The main
atmospheric parameters were retrieved using the LBLRTM radiative transfer code,
which was also utilised to study the impact of variability of the main
molecular bands of O2, O3, and H2O, and to estimate their column densities.
Results: In general, the extinction curve of Paranal appears to conform to
those derived for other astronomical sites in the Atacama desert, like La Silla
and Cerro Tololo. However, a systematic deficit with respect to the extinction
curve derived for Cerro Tololo before the El Chichon eruption is detected below
4000 A. We attribute this downturn to a non standard aerosol composition,
probably revealing the presence of volcanic pollutants above the Atacama
desert. An analysis of all spectroscopic extinction curves obtained since 1974
shows that the aerosol composition has been evolving during the last 35 years.
The persistence of traces of non meteorologic haze suggests the effect of
volcanic eruptions, like those of El Chichon and Pinatubo, lasts several
decades. The usage of the standard CTIO and La Silla extinction curves
implemented in IRAF and MIDAS produce systematic over/under-estimates of the
absolute flux.

    <title>Multiscale periodicities in aerosol optical depth over India</title>
    <summary>  Aerosols exhibit periodic or cyclic variations depending on natural and
anthropogenic sources over a region, which can get modulated by synoptic
meteorological parameters such as winds, rainfall and relative humidity, and
long-range transport. Information on periodicity and phase in aerosol
properties assumes significance in prediction as well as to examine the
radiative and climate effects of aerosols including its association with
changes in cloud properties and rainfall. Periodicity in aerosol optical depth,
which is a columnar measure of aerosol distribution, is determined using
continuous wavelet transform over 35 locations in India. Continuous wavelet
transform is used in the study because it is better suited to extract the
periodic and local modulations present at various frequency ranges, as these
features are invisible in conventional methods such as Fourier Transform.
Monthly mean aerosol optical depths (AODs) from MODerate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra satellite from January 2001 to
December 2012 are used. Annual and quasi-biennial oscillations (QBO) in AOD are
evident in addition to the weak semi-annual and quasi-triennial. The
semi-annual and annual oscillations are consistent with the seasonal and yearly
cycle of variations in AODs. The 40-month periodicity indicates the presence of
long term correlations in AOD. The observed periodicities in MODIS Terra AODs
are also evident in the ground-based AOD measurements made over Kanpur in the
Indo-Gangetic Plain. The phase of the periodicity in AOD is stable in the
mid-frequency range, while local disturbances in the high-frequency range and
long term changes in the atmospheric composition give rise to unstable phases
in low-frequency range. That modulations in AOD over one location/region can
influence the other is revealed by the presence of phase relation among
different locations.

    <title>Night-sky brightness monitoring in Hong Kong - a city-wide light
  pollution assessment</title>
    <summary>  Results of the first comprehensive light pollution survey in Hong Kong are
presented. The night-sky brightness was measured and monitored around the city
using a portable light sensing device called the Sky Quality Meter over a
15-month period beginning in March 2008. A total of 1,957 data sets were taken
at 199 distinct locations, including urban and rural sites covering all 18
Administrative Districts of Hong Kong. The survey shows that the environmental
light pollution problem in Hong Kong is severe - the urban night-skies (sky
brightness at 15.0 mag per arcsec square) are on average ~100 times brighter
than at the darkest rural sites (20.1 mag per arcsec square), indicating that
the high lighting densities in the densely populated residential and commercial
areas lead to light pollution. In the worst polluted urban location studied,
the night-sky at 13.2 mag per arcsec square can be over 500 times brighter than
the darkest sites in Hong Kong. The observed night-sky brightness is found to
be affected by human factors such as land utilization and population density of
the observation sites, together with meteorological and/or environmental
factors. Moreover, earlier night-skies (at 9:30pm local time) are generally
brighter than later time (at 11:30pm), which can be attributed to some public
and commercial lightings being turned off later at night. On the other hand, no
concrete relationship between the observed sky brightness and air pollutant
concentrations could be established with the limited survey sampling. Results
from this survey will serve as an important database for the public to assess
whether new rules and regulations are necessary to control the use of outdoor
lightings in Hong Kong.

    <title>An Operational Search and Rescue Model for the Norwegian Sea and the
  North Sea</title>
    <summary>  A new operational, ensemble-based search and rescue model for the Norwegian
Sea and the North Sea is presented. The stochastic trajectory model computes
the net motion of a range of search and rescue objects. A new, robust
formulation for the relation between the wind and the motion of the drifting
object (termed the leeway of the object) is employed. Empirically derived
coefficients for 63 categories of search objects compiled by the US Coast Guard
are ingested to estimate the leeway of the drifting objects. A Monte Carlo
technique is employed to generate an ensemble that accounts for the
uncertainties in forcing fields (wind and current), leeway drift properties,
and the initial position of the search object. The ensemble yields an estimate
of the time-evolving probability density function of the location of the search
object, and its envelope defines the search area. Forcing fields from the
operational oceanic and atmospheric forecast system of The Norwegian
Meteorological Institute are used as input to the trajectory model. This allows
for the first time high-resolution wind and current fields to be used to
forecast search areas up to 60 hours into the future. A limited set of field
exercises show good agreement between model trajectories, search areas, and
observed trajectories for liferafts and other search objects. Comparison with
older methods shows that search areas expand much more slowly using the new
ensemble method with high resolution forcing fields and the new leeway
formulation. It is found that going to higher-order stochastic trajectory
models will not significantly improve the forecast skill and the rate of
expansion of search areas.

    <title>Millimeter and sub-millimeter atmospheric performance at Dome C
  combining radiosoundings and ATM synthetic spectra</title>
    <summary>  The reliability of astronomical observations at millimeter and sub-millimeter
wavelengths closely depends on a low vertical content of water vapor as well as
on high atmospheric emission stability. Although Concordia station at Dome C
(Antarctica) enjoys good observing conditions in this atmospheric spectral
windows, as shown by preliminary site-testing campaigns at different bands and
in, not always, time overlapped periods, a dedicated instrument able to
continuously determine atmospheric performance for a wide spectral range is not
yet planned. In the absence of such measurements, in this paper we suggest a
semi-empirical approach to perform an analysis of atmospheric transmission and
emission at Dome C to compare the performance for 7 photometric bands ranging
from 100 GHz to 2 THz. Radiosoundings data provided by the Routine
Meteorological Observations (RMO) Research Project at Concordia station are
corrected by temperature and humidity errors and dry biases and then employed
to feed ATM (Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves) code to generate synthetic
spectra in the wide spectral range from 100 GHz to 2 THz. To quantify the
atmospheric contribution in millimeter and sub-millimeter observations we are
considering several photometric bands in which atmospheric quantities are
integrated. The observational capabilities of this site at all the selected
spectral bands are analyzed considering monthly averaged transmissions joined
to the corresponding fluctuations. Transmission and pwv statistics at Dome C
derived by our semi-empirical approach are consistent with previous works. It
is evident the decreasing of the performance at high frequencies. We propose to
introduce a new parameter to compare the quality of a site at different
spectral bands, in terms of high transmission and emission stability, the Site
Photometric Quality Factor.

    <title>A 1D microphysical cloud model for Earth, and Earth-like exoplanets.
  Liquid water and water ice clouds in the convective troposphere</title>
    <summary>  One significant difference between the atmospheres of stars and exoplanets is
the presence of condensed particles (clouds or hazes) in the atmosphere of the
latter.
  The main goal of this paper is to develop a self-consistent microphysical
cloud model for 1D atmospheric codes, which can reproduce some observed
properties of Earth, such as the average albedo, surface temperature, and
global energy budget. The cloud model is designed to be computationally
efficient, simple to implement, and applicable for a wide range of atmospheric
parameters for planets in the habitable zone.
  We use a 1D, cloud-free, radiative-convective, and photochemical equilibrium
code originally developed by Kasting, Pavlov, Segura, and collaborators as
basis for our cloudy atmosphere model. The cloud model is based on models used
by the meteorology community for Earth's clouds. The free parameters of the
model are the relative humidity and number density of condensation nuclei, and
the precipitation efficiency. In a 1D model, the cloud coverage cannot be
self-consistently determined, thus we treat it as a free parameter.
  We apply this model to Earth (aerosol number density 100 cm^-3, relative
humidity 77 %, liquid cloud fraction 40 %, and ice cloud fraction 25 %) and
find that a precipitation efficiency of 0.8 is needed to reproduce the albedo,
average surface temperature and global energy budget of Earth. We perform
simulations to determine how the albedo and the climate of a planet is
influenced by the free parameters of the cloud model. We find that the
planetary climate is most sensitive to changes in the liquid water cloud
fraction and precipitation efficiency.
  The advantage of our cloud model is that the cloud height and the droplet
sizes are self-consistently calculated, both of which influence the climate and
albedo of exoplanets.

    <title>Examining a solar climate link in diurnal temperature ranges</title>
    <summary>  A recent study has suggested a link between the surface level diurnal
temperature range (DTR) and variations in the cosmic ray (CR) flux. As the DTR
is an effective proxy for cloud cover, this result supports the notion that
widespread cloud changes may be induced by the CR flux. If confirmed, this
would have significant implications for our understanding of natural climate
forcings. Here, we perform a detailed investigation of the relationships
between DTR and solar activity (total solar irradiance and the CR flux) from
more than 60 years of NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and observations from
meteorological station data. We find no statistically significant evidence to
suggest that the DTR is connected to either long-term solar periodicities (11
or 1.68 year) or short-term (daily-timescale) fluctuations in solar activity,
and we attribute previous reports on the contrary to an incorrect estimation of
the statistical significance of the data. If a CR-DTR relationship exists,
based on the estimated noise in DTR composites during Forbush decrease (FD)
events, the DTR response would need to be larger than 0.03{\deg}C per 1%
increase in the CR flux to be reliably detected. Compared with a much smaller
rough estimate of -0.005{\deg}C per 1% increase in the CR flux expected if
previous claims that FD events cause reductions in the cloud cover are valid,
we conclude it is not possible to detect a solar related responses in
station-based or reanalysis-based DTR datasets related to a hypothesized
CR-cloud link, as potential signals would be drowned in noise.

    <title>Why does air passage over forest yield more rain? Examining the coupling
  between rainfall, pressure and atmospheric moisture content</title>
    <summary>  The influence of forest loss on rainfall remains poorly understood.
Addressing this challenge Spracklen et al. recently presented a pan-tropical
study of rainfall and land-cover that showed that satellite-derived rainfall
measures were positively correlated with the degree to which model-derived air
trajectories had been exposed to forest cover. This result confirms the
influence of vegetation on regional rainfall patterns suggested in previous
studies. However, we find that the conclusion of Spracklen et al. -- that
differences in rainfall reflect air moisture content resulting from
evapotranspiration while the circulation pattern remains unchanged -- appears
undermined by methodological inconsistencies. We identify methodological
problems with the underlying analyses and the quantitative estimates for
rainfall change predicted if forest cover is lost in the Amazon. We discuss
some alternative explanations that include the distinct role of forest
evapotranspiration in creating low pressure systems that draw moisture from the
oceans to the continental hinterland. Our analysis of meteorological data from
three regions in Brazil, including the central Amazon forest, reveal a tendency
for rainy days during the wet season with column water vapor (CWV) exceeding 50
mm to have higher pressure than rainless days; while at lower CWV rainy days
tend to have lower pressure than rainless days. The coupling between
atmospheric moisture content and circulation dynamics underlines that the
danger posed by forest loss is greater than suggested by focusing only on
moisture recycling alone.

    <title>Retrieving Atmospheric Dust Opacity on Mars by Imaging Spectroscopy at
  Large Angles</title>
    <summary>  We propose a new method to retrieve the optical depth of Martian aerosols
(AOD) from OMEGA and CRISM hyperspectral imagery at a reference wavelength of 1
{\mu}m. Our method works even if the underlying surface is completely made of
minerals, corresponding to a low contrast between surface and atmospheric dust,
while being observed at a fixed geometry. Minimizing the effect of the surface
reflectance properties on the AOD retrieval is the second principal asset of
our method. The method is based on the parametrization of the radiative
coupling between particles and gas determining, with local altimetry,
acquisition geometry, and the meteorological situation, the absorption band
depth of gaseous CO2. Because the last three factors can be predicted to some
extent, we can define a new parameter {\beta} that expresses specifically the
strength of the gas-aerosols coupling while directly depending on the AOD.
Combining estimations of {\beta} and top of the atmosphere radiance values
extracted from the observed spectra within the CO2 gas band at 2 {\mu}m, we
evaluate the AOD and the surface reflectance by radiative transfer inversion.
One should note that practically {\beta} can be estimated for a large variety
of mineral or icy surfaces with the exception of CO2 ice when its 2 {\mu}m
solid band is not sufficiently saturated. Validation of the proposed method
shows that it is reliable if two conditions are fulfilled: (i) the observation
conditions provide large incidence or/and emergence angles (ii) the aerosol are
vertically well mixed in the atmosphere. Experiments conducted on OMEGA nadir
looking observations as well as CRISM EPF acquisitions with incidence angles
higher than 65{\deg} and 33{\deg} respectively produce very satisfactory
results. Finally in a companion paper the method is applied to monitoring
atmospheric dust spring activity at high southern latitudes on Mars using
OMEGA.

    <title>Wave dispersion in the hybrid-Vlasov model: verification of Vlasiator</title>
    <summary>  Vlasiator is a new hybrid-Vlasov plasma simulation code aimed at simulating
the entire magnetosphere of the Earth. The code treats ions (protons)
kinetically through Vlasov's equation in the six-dimensional phase space while
electrons are a massless charge-neutralizing fluid [M. Palmroth et al., Journal
of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 99, 41 (2013); A. Sandroos et al.,
Parallel Computing 39, 306 (2013)]. For first global simulations of the
magnetosphere, it is critical to verify and validate the model by established
methods. Here, as part of the verification of Vlasiator, we characterize the
low-$\beta$ plasma wave modes described by this model and compare with the
solution computed by the Waves in Homogeneous, Anisotropic Multicomponent
Plasmas (WHAMP) code [K. R\"onnmark, Kiruna Geophysical Institute Reports 179
(1982)], using dispersion curves and surfaces produced with both programs. The
match between the two fundamentally different approaches is excellent in the
low-frequency, long wavelength range which is of interest in global
magnetospheric simulations. The left-hand and right-hand polarized wave modes
as well as the Bernstein modes in the Vlasiator simulations agree well with the
WHAMP solutions. Vlasiator allows a direct investigation of the importance of
the Hall term by including it in or excluding it from Ohm's law in simulations.
This is illustrated showing examples of waves obtained using the ideal Ohm's
law and Ohm's law including the Hall term. Our analysis emphasizes the role of
the Hall term in Ohm's law in obtaining wave modes departing from ideal
magnetohydrodynamics in the hybrid-Vlasov model.

    <title>TAPAS, a web-based service of atmospheric transmission computation for
  astronomy</title>
    <summary>  Spectra of astronomical targets acquired from ground-based instruments are
affected by the atmospheric transmission. The authors and their institutes are
developing a web-based service, TAPAS (Transmissions of the AtmosPhere for
AStromomical data). This service, freely available, is developed and maintained
within the atmospheric ETHER data center. TAPAS computes the atmospheric
transmission in the line-of-sight to the target indicated by the user. The user
files a request indicating the time, ground location, and either the equatorial
coordinates of the target or the Zenith Angle of the line-of sight (LOS). The
actual atmospheric profile (temperature, pressure, humidity, ozone content) at
that time and place is retrieved from the ETHER atmospheric data base (from a
combination of ECMWF meteorological field and other informations), and the
atmospheric transmission is computed from LBLRTM software and HITRAN data base
for a number of gases: O2, H2O, O3, CO2, and Rayleigh extinction. The first
purpose of TAPAS output is to allow identification of observed spectral
features as being from atmospheric or astrophysical origin. The returned
transmission may also serve for characterizing the spectrometer in wavelength
scale and Instrument Line Spectral Function (ILSF) by comparing one observed
spectrum of an atmospheric feature to the transmission. Finally, the TOA (Top
Of Atmosphere) spectrum may be obtained either by division of the observed
spectrum by the computed transmission or other techniques developed on purpose.
The obtention of transmissions for individual species allows more
potentialities and better adjustments to the data. In this paper, we describe
briefly the mechanism of computation of the atmospheric transmissions, and we
show some results for O2 and H2O atmospheric absorption. The wavelength range
is presently 500-2500 nm. The address is http://ether.ipsl.jussieu.fr/tapas/

    <title>The night-sky at the Calar Alto Observatory II: The sky at the near
  infrared</title>
    <summary>  We present here the characterization of the night sky-brightness at the
near-infrared, the telescope seeing, and the fraction of useful time at the
Calar Alto observatory. For this study we have collected a large dataset
comprising 7311 near-infrared images taken regularly along the last four years
for the ALHAMBRA survey (J, H and Ks-bands), together with a more reduced
dataset of additional near-infrared images taken for the current study. In
addition we collected the information derived by the meteorological station at
the observatory during the last 10 years, together with the results from the
cloud sensor for the last ~2 years. We analyze the dependency of the
near-infrared night sky-brightness with the airmass and the seasons, studying
its origins and proposing a zenithal correction. A strong correlation is found
between the night sky-brightness in the Ks-band and the air temperature, with a
gradient of ~ -0.08 mag per 1 C degree. The typical (darkest) night
sky-brightness in the J, H and Ks-band are 15.95 mag (16.95 mag), 13.99 mag
(14.98 mag) and 12.39 mag (13.55 mag), respectively. These values show that
Calar Alto is as dark in the near-infrared as most of the other astronomical
astronomical sites in the world that we could compare with. Only Mauna Kea is
clearly darker in the Ks-band. The typical telescope seeing at the 3.5m is
~1.0" when converted to the V-band, being only slightly larger than the
atmospheric seeing measured at the same time by the seeing monitor, ~0.9".
Finally we estimate the fraction of useful time based on the relative humidity,
gust wind speed and presence of clouds. This fraction, ~72%, is very similar to
the one derived in Paper I, based on the fraction of time when the extinction
monitor is working.

    <title>On a general definition of the squared Brunt-Väisälä
  Frequency associated with the specific moist entropy potential temperature</title>
    <summary>  The squared Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} Frequency (BVF) is computed in terms of
the moist entropy potential temperature recently defined in Marquet (2011).
Both homogeneously saturated and non-saturated versions of $N^2$ (the squared
BVF) are derived. The method employed for computing these special homogeneous
cases relies on the expression of density written as a function of pressure,
total water content and specific moist entropy only. The associated
conservative variable diagrams are discussed and compared with existing ones.
Despite being obtained without any simplification, the formulations for $N^2$
remain nicely compact and are clearly linked with the squared BVF expressed in
terms of the adiabatic non-saturated and saturated lapse rates. As in previous
similar expressions, the extreme homogeneous solutions for $N^2$ are of course
different, but they are not analytically discontinuous. This allows us to
define a simple bridging expression for a single general shape of $N^2$,
depending only on the basic mean atmospheric quantities and on a transition
parameter, to be defined (or parameterized) in connection with the type of
application sought. This integrated result remains a linear combination (with
complex but purely local weights) of two terms only, namely the environmental
gradient of the moist entropy potential temperature and the environmental
gradient of the total water content. Simplified versions of the various
equations are also proposed for the case in which the moist entropy potential
temperature is approximated by a function of both so-called moist-conservative
variables of Betts (1973).

    <title>El Roque de Los Muchachos Site Characteristics. III. Analysis of
  Atmospheric Dust and Aerosol Extinction</title>
    <summary>  Canary Islands are normally interested by dominant North-East winds that, in
some meteorological conditions, can transport sand at high altitude from the
Sahara desert. The dust may affect the efficiency of the telescopes and
decreases the transparency of the sky. In order to maximize the scientific
return of the telescopes located at the ORM, we present an analysis of the
atmospheric dust content and its effects on astronomical observations. B, V and
I dust aerosol astronomical extinction are derived. Using a 5 years series
database of data taken from the four channel TNG dust monitor, we compute a
mean hourly and daily values of the dust content. We have detected particles
having size 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 um. Using a power law we have derived the
content of 10.0 um particles. We found a typical local dust concentration
ranging from 3x10^6 particles per cubic meter at 0.3 um, to 10^3 at 5.0 um and
10 at 10.0 um, increasing up to 3 order of magnitudes during the dust storms,
with a relative higher increase of 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 um particles. The number
of local dust storm events is the same in winter- and summertime, but, the
average background and storm-related increases in the dust concentration in
summer are significantly higher than in winter. In a uniform approximation,
during the dust storms, an average height of the dust layer of 2.5 km above the
telescope is inferred. During the sand storms La Palma Island is affected by an
almost uniform layer extending up to 5 km above the sea level, down, at least
the height of the telescope. The visible extinction is dominated by particles
at 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 um. In agreement with the results from Carlsberg Automatic
Meridian Circle (CAMC) we find a typical extinction during dust storms of about
0.2 mag/airmass.

    <title>The association between stratospheric weak polar vortex events and cold
  air outbreaks</title>
    <summary>  Previous studies have identified an association between near-surface
temperature anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere and weak stratospheric polar
westerlies. Large regions in northern Asia, Europe and North America have been
found to cool in the mature and late stages of stratospheric weak vortex
events. A substantial part of the temperature changes are associated with
changes to the tropospheric Northern Annular Mode and North Atlantic
Oscillation pressure patterns. The apparent coupling between the stratosphere
and the troposphere may be of relevance for weather forecasting, but only if
the temporal and spatial nature of the coupling is known. Here we show, using
51 winters of re-analysis data, that the tropospheric temperature development
relative to stratospheric weak polar vortex events goes through a series of
well-defined stages, including geographically distinct cold air outbreaks. At
the inception of weak vortex events, a precursor signal in the form of a strong
high-pressure anomaly is found over Northwest Europe. At the same time,
long-lived and robust cold anomalies appear over Asia and Western Europe. A few
weeks later, near the mature stage of weak vortex events, a shorter-lived cold
anomaly emerges off the east coast of North America.The probability of cold air
outbreaks in different phases of the weak vortex life cycle increases by 40-70
% in four key regions. This shows that the stratospheric polar vortex contains
information that can be used to enhance forecasts of cold air outbreaks.
300-year pre-industrial control runs of 11 state-of-the-art coupled climate
models corroborate our results.

    <title>Mesoscale Optical Turbulence simulations at Dome C</title>
    <summary>  These last years ground-based astronomy has been looking towards Antarctica,
especially its summits and the internal continental plateau where the optical
turbulence (OT) appears to be confined in a shallow layer close to the surface.
Preliminary measurements have so far indicated pretty good value for the seeing
above 30-35 m: 0.36" (Agabi et al. 2006), 0.27" (Lawrence et al. 2004) and 0.3"
(Trinquet et al. 2008) at Dome C. Site testing campaigns are however extremely
expensive, instruments provide only local measurements and atmospheric modeling
might represent a step ahead towards the search and selection of astronomical
sites thanks to the possibility to reconstruct 3D Cn2 maps over a surface of
several kilometers. The Antarctic Plateau represents therefore an important
benchmark test to evaluate the possibility to discriminate sites on the same
plateau. Our group (Hagelin et al. 2008) has proven that the analyses from the
ECMWF global model do not describe with the required accuracy the antarctic
boundary and surface layers in the plateau. A better description could be
obtained with a mesoscale model. The Meso-Nh model has proven to be reliable in
reproducing 3D maps of OT above mid-latitude astronomical sites (Masciadri et
al. 1999ab, 2004, Masciadri and Jabouille 2005). In this paper we study the
ability of the Meso-Nh model in reconstructing the meteorological parameters as
well as the OT above Dome C with different model configurations. We concentrate
our attention on the model abilities in reproducing the OT surface layer
thickness Hsl and the integral of the Cn2 in the free atmosphere and in the
surface layer. It is worth to highlight that these are the first estimates ever
done so far with a mesoscale model of the optical turbulence above the internal
Antarctic Plateau.

    <title>Goals and strategies in the global control design of the OAJ Robotic
  Observatory</title>
    <summary>  There are many ways to solve the challenging problem of making a high
performance robotic observatory from scratch. The Observatorio Astrof\'isico de
Javalambre (OAJ) is a new astronomical facility located at the Sierra de
Javalambre (Teruel, Spain) whose primary role will be to conduct all-sky
astronomical surveys. The OAJ control system has been designed under a global
point of view including not only astronomical subsystems but also
infrastructure and other facilities. Three main factors have been considered in
the design of a global control system for the robotic OAJ: quality, reliability
and efficiency. We propose CIA (Control Integrated Architecture) design and OEE
(Overall Equipment Effectiveness) as a key performance indicator in order to
improve operation processes, minimizing resources and obtain high cost
reduction maintaining quality requirements. The OAJ subsystems considered for
the control integrated architecture are the following: two wide-field
telescopes and their instrumentation, active optics subsystems, facilities for
sky quality monitoring (seeing, extinction, sky background, sky brightness,
clouds distribution, meteorological station), domes and several infrastructure
facilities such as water supply, glycol water, water treatment plant, air
conditioning, compressed air, LN2 plant, illumination, surveillance, access
control, fire suppression, electrical generators, electrical distribution,
electrical consumption, communication network, Uninterruptible Power Supply and
two main control rooms, one at the OAJ and other remotely located in Teruel at
40km from the observatory, connected through a microwave radio-link. Here we
present the OAJ strategy in control design to achieve maximum quality
efficiency for the observatory processes and operations, giving practical
examples of our approach.

    <title>E-sail test payload of ESTCube-1 nanosatellite</title>
    <summary>  The scientific mission of ESTCube-1, launched in May 2013, is to measure the
Electric solar wind sail (E-sail) force in orbit. The experiment is planned to
push forward the development of E-sail, a propulsion method recently invented
at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. E-sail is based on extracting momentum
from the solar wind plasma flow by using long thin electrically charged
tethers. ESTCube-1 is equipped with one such tether, together with hardware
capable of deploying and charging it. At the orbital altitude of ESTCube-1
(660--680~km) there is no solar wind present. Instead, ESTCube-1 shall observe
the interaction between the charged tether and the ionospheric plasma. The
ESTCube-1 payload uses a 10-meter, partly two-filament E-sail tether and a
motorized reel on which it is stored. The tether shall be deployed from a
spinning satellite with the help of centrifugal force. An additional mass is
added at the tip of the tether to assist with the deployment. During E-sail
experiment the tether shall be charged to 500~V potential. Both positive and
negative voltages shall be experimented with. The voltage is provided by a
dedicated high voltage source and delivered to the tether through a slip ring
contact. When the negative voltage is applied to the tether, the satellite body
is expected to attract electron flow capable of compensating for the ion flow,
which runs to the tether from the surrounding plasma. With the positive voltage
applied, onboard cold cathode electron guns are used to remove excess electrons
to maintain the positive voltage of the tether. In this paper we present the
design and structure of the tether payload of ESTCube-1.

    <title>Copper passivation procedure for water-filled copper cells for
  applications in metrology</title>
    <summary>  In the framework of the European research project MeteoMet, the LNE-CNAM and
the LNE-CETIAT are developing novel copper cells for the determination of the
water vapour pressure equation and the measurement of the triple point of water
temperature at the highest degree of accuracy.
  The Water Vapour Pressure Equation (WVPE) is the basic formula for the
calculation of the vapour pressure and other humidity related quantities.
Improvement in the uncertainty of the water vapour formulation in the
temperature range between -80^{\cdot}C (and possibly down to -90^{\cdot}C) and
+100^{\cdot}C is needed for the improvement of primary standards in the field
of hygrometry. The Triple Point of Water (TPW, temperature 273,16 K) plays a
key role in thermometry, because of its threefold function. On one side, it
defines the temperature unit, the kelvin. On the other side, it is the
reference point in Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer (SPRT)
calibrations, according to the International Temperature Scale of 1990
(ITS-90). Finally, it is the connection point between the current definition of
the kelvin and the future one, based on the Boltzmann constant.
  Copper cells for WVPE and TPW allow highly accurate temperature control, fast
thermal response time and excellent thermal uniformity, because of the elevated
copper thermal conductivity. Thus, they can be an outstanding tool for reducing
measurement uncertainty. Nevertheless, accurate filling techniques and
procedures are necessary, to minimize water contamination and get stable,
accurate and reproducible results.
  This report describes the filling system and the copper passivation and
cleaning procedure, as well as the method for filling copper cells with
high-purity water.

    <title>Spatiotemporal clustering, climate periodicity, and social-ecological
  risk factors for dengue during an outbreak in Machala, Ecuador, in 2010</title>
    <summary>  The objective of this study was to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics
and climatic and social-ecological risk factors associated with the largest
dengue epidemic to date in Machala, Ecuador, to inform the development of a
dengue EWS. The following data were included in analyses: neighborhood-level
georeferenced dengue cases, national census data, and entomological
surveillance data from 2010; time series of weekly dengue cases (aggregated to
the city-level) and meteorological data from 2003 to 2012. We applied LISA and
Morans I to analyze the spatial distribution of the 2010 dengue cases, and
developed multivariate logistic regression models through a multi-model
selection process to identify census variables and entomological covariates
associated with the presence of dengue at the neighborhood level. Using data
aggregated at the city-level, we conducted a time-series (wavelet) analysis of
weekly climate and dengue incidence (2003-2012) to identify significant time
periods (e.g., annual, biannual) when climate co-varied with dengue, and to
describe the climate conditions associated with the 2010 outbreak. We found
significant hotspots of dengue transmission near the center of Machala. The
best-fit model to predict the presence of dengue included older age and female
gender of the head of the household, greater access to piped water in the home,
poor housing condition, and less distance to the central hospital. Wavelet
analyses revealed that dengue transmission co-varied with rainfall and minimum
temperature at annual and biannual cycles, and we found that anomalously high
rainfall and temperatures were associated with the 2010 outbreak. Our findings
highlight the importance of geospatial information in dengue surveillance and
the potential to develop a climate-driven spatiotemporal prediction models to
inform disease prevention and control interventions.

    <title>A dynamic nonstationary spatio-temporal model for short term prediction
  of precipitation</title>
    <summary>  Precipitation is a complex physical process that varies in space and time.
Predictions and interpolations at unobserved times and/or locations help to
solve important problems in many areas. In this paper, we present a
hierarchical Bayesian model for spatio-temporal data and apply it to obtain
short term predictions of rainfall. The model incorporates physical knowledge
about the underlying processes that determine rainfall, such as advection,
diffusion and convection. It is based on a temporal autoregressive convolution
with spatially colored and temporally white innovations. By linking the
advection parameter of the convolution kernel to an external wind vector, the
model is temporally nonstationary. Further, it allows for nonseparable and
anisotropic covariance structures. With the help of the Voronoi tessellation,
we construct a natural parametrization, that is, space as well as time
resolution consistent, for data lying on irregular grid points. In the
application, the statistical model combines forecasts of three other
meteorological variables obtained from a numerical weather prediction model
with past precipitation observations. The model is then used to predict
three-hourly precipitation over 24 hours. It performs better than a separable,
stationary and isotropic version, and it performs comparably to a deterministic
numerical weather prediction model for precipitation and has the advantage that
it quantifies prediction uncertainty.

    <title>A hierarchy of energy- and flux-budget (EFB) turbulence closure models
  for stably stratified geophysical flows</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we advance physical background of the energy- and flux-budget
turbulence closure based on the budget equations for the turbulent kinetic and
potential energies and turbulent fluxes of momentum and buoyancy, and a new
relaxation equation for the turbulent dissipation time-scale. The closure is
designed for stratified geophysical flows from neutral to very stable and
accounts for the Earth rotation. In accordance to modern experimental evidence,
the closure implies maintaining of turbulence by the velocity shear at any
gradient Richardson number Ri, and distinguishes between the two principally
different regimes: "strong turbulence" at Ri &lt;&lt; 1 typical of boundary-layer
flows and characterised by the practically constant turbulent Prandtl number;
and "weak turbulence" at Ri &gt; 1 typical of the free atmosphere or deep ocean,
where the turbulent Prandtl number asymptotically linearly increases with
increasing Ri (which implies very strong suppression of the heat transfer
compared to the momentum transfer). For use in different applications, the
closure is formulated at different levels of complexity, from the local
algebraic model relevant to the steady-state regime of turbulence to a
hierarchy of non-local closures including simpler down-gradient models,
presented in terms of the eddy-viscosity and eddy-conductivity, and general
non-gradient model based on prognostic equations for all basic parameters of
turbulence including turbulent fluxes.

    <title>Changes in Sea-Level Pressure over South Korea Associated with
  High-Speed Solar Wind Events</title>
    <summary>  We explore a possibility that the daily sea-level pressure (SLP) over South
Korea responds to the high-speed solar wind event. This is of interest in two
aspects: First, if there is a statistical association this can be another piece
of evidence showing that various meteorological observables indeed respond to
variations in the interplanetary environment. Second, this can be a very
crucial observational constraint since most models proposed so far are expected
to preferentially work in higher latitude regions than the low latitude region
studied here. We have examined daily solar wind speed ${\rm V}$, daily SLP
difference ${\rm \Delta SLP}$, and daily ${\rm \log(BV^{2})}$ using the
superposed epoch analysis in which the key date is set such that the daily
solar wind speed exceeds 800 ${\rm kms^{-1}}$. We find that the daily ${\rm
\Delta SLP}$ averaged out of 12 events reaches its peak at day +1 and gradually
decreases back to its normal level. The amount of positive deviation of ${\rm
\Delta SLP}$ is +2.5 hPa. The duration of deviation is a few days. We also find
that ${\rm \Delta SLP}$ is well correlated with both the speed of solar wind
and ${\rm \log(BV^{2})}$. The obtained linear correlation coefficients and
chance probabilities with one-day lag for two cases are $r \simeq 0.81$ with
$P&gt; 99.9%$, and $r \simeq 0.84$ with $P&gt; 99.9%$, respectively. We conclude by
briefly discussing future direction to pursue.

    <title>Determining Key Model Parameters of Rapidly Intensifying Hurricane
  Guillermo(1997) using the Ensemble Kalman Filter</title>
    <summary>  In this work we determine key model parameters for rapidly intensifying
Hurricane Guillermo (1997) using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The
approach is to utilize the EnKF as a tool to only estimate the parameter values
of the model for a particular data set. The assimilation is performed using
dual-Doppler radar observations obtained during the period of rapid
intensification of Hurricane Guillermo. A unique aspect of Guillermo was that
during the period of radar observations strong convective bursts, attributable
to wind shear, formed primarily within the eastern semicircle of the eyewall.
To reproduce this observed structure within a hurricane model, background wind
shear of some magnitude must be specified; as well as turbulence and surface
parameters appropriately specified so that the impact of the shear on the
simulated hurricane vortex can be realized. To identify the complex nonlinear
interactions induced by changes in these parameters, an ensemble of model
simulations have been conducted in which individual members were formulated by
sampling the parameters within a certain range via a Latin hypercube approach.
The ensemble and the data, derived latent heat and horizontal winds from the
dual-Doppler radar observations, are utilized in the EnKF to obtain varying
estimates of the model parameters. The parameters are estimated at each time
instance, and a final parameter value is obtained by computing the average over
time. Individual simulations were conducted using the estimates, with the
simulation using latent heat parameter estimates producing the lowest overall
model forecast error.

    <title>Climate Dynamics: A Network-Based Approach for the Analysis of Global
  Precipitation</title>
    <summary>  Precipitation is one of the most important meteorological variables for
defining the climate dynamics, but the spatial patterns of precipitation have
not been fully investigated yet. The complex network theory, which provides a
robust tool to investigate the statistical interdependence of many interacting
elements, is used here to analyze the spatial dynamics of annual precipitation
over seventy years (1941-2010).
  The precipitation network reveals significant spatial variability with barely
connected regions, as Eastern China and Japan, and highly connected regions,
such as the African Sahel, Eastern Australia and, to a lesser extent, Northern
Europe. Sahel and Eastern Australia are remarkably dry regions, where low
amounts of rainfall are uniformly distributed on continental scales and
small-scale extreme events are rare. As a consequence, the precipitation
gradient is low, making these regions well connected on a large spatial scale.
On the contrary, the Asiatic South-East is often reached by extreme events such
as monsoons, tropical cyclones and heat waves, which can all contribute to
reduce the correlation to the short-range scale only.
  Some patterns emerging between mid-latitude and tropical regions suggest a
possible impact of the propagation of planetary waves on precipitation at a
global scale. Other links can be qualitatively associated to the atmospheric
and oceanic circulation. To analyze the sensitivity of the network to the
physical closeness of the nodes, short-term connections are broken. The African
Sahel, Eastern Australia and Northern Europe regions again appear as the
supernodes of the network, confirming furthermore their long-range connection
structure. Almost all North-American and Asian nodes vanish, revealing that
extreme events can enhance high precipitation gradients, leading to a
systematic absence of long-range patterns.

    <title>An international campaign of the 19th century to determine the solar
  parallax - The US Naval expedition to the southern hemisphere 1849 - 1852</title>
    <summary>  In 1847 Christian Ludwig Gerling, Marburg (Germany), suggested the solar
parallax to be determined by measuring the position of Venus close to its
inferior conjunction, especially at the stationary points, from observatories
on nearly the same meridian but widely differing in latitude. James M.
Gilliss,astronomer at the newly founded U.S. Naval Observatory,
enthusiastically adopted this idea and procured a grant for the young
astronomical community of the United States for an expedition to Chile. There
they were to observe several conjunctions of Venus and oppositions of Mars,
while the accompanying measurements were to be taken at the US Naval
Observatory in Washington D.C. and the Harvard College Observatory at
Cambridge, USA. This expedition was supported by A. v. Humboldt, C.F. Gau{\ss},
J.F. Encke, S.C. Walker, A.D. Bache, B. Peirce and others. From 1849 to 1852
not only were astronomical, but also meteorological and magnetic observations
and measurements recorded, mainly in Santa Lucia close to Santiago, Chile. By
comparing these measurements with those taken simultaneously at other
observatories around the world the solar parallax could be calculated, although
incomplete data from the corresponding northern observatories threatened the
project's success. In retrospect this expedition can be recognized as the
foundation of the Chilean astronomy. The first director of the new National
Astronomical Observatory of Chile was Dr. C.W. Moesta, a Hessian student of
Christian Ludwig Gerling's. The exchange of data between German, American and
other astronomers during this expedition was well mediated by J.G. Fl\"ugel,
consul of the United States of America and representative of the Smithsonian
Institution in Europe, who altogether played a major role in nurturing the
relationship between the growing scientific community in the U.S. and the well
established one in Europe at that time.

    <title>Toward an integrated system for fire, smoke, and air quality simulations</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we describe how WRF-Sfire is coupled with WRF-Chem to
construct WRFSC, an integrated forecast system for wildfire and smoke
prediction. The integrated forecast system has the advantage of not requiring a
simple plume-rise model and assumptions about the size and heat release from
the fire in order to determine fire emissions into the atmosphere. With
WRF-Sfire, wildfire spread, plume and plume-top heights are predicted directly,
at every WRF timestep, providing comprehensive meteorology and fire emissions
to the chemical transport model WRF-Chem. Evaluation of WRFSC was based on
comparisons between available observations to the results of two WRFSC
simulations. The study found overall good agreement between forecasted and
observed fire spread and smoke transport for the Witch-Guejito fire. Also the
simulated PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) peak concentrations matched the
observations. However, the NO and ozone levels were underestimated in the
simulations and the peak concentrations were mistimed. Determining the terminal
or plume-top height is one of the most important aspects of simulating wildfire
plume transport, and the study found overall good agreement between simulated
and observed plume-top heights, with some (10% or less) underestimation by the
simulations. One of the most promising results of the study was the agreement
between passive-tracer modeled plume-top heights for the Barker Canyon fire
simulation and observations. This simulation took only 13h, with the first 24h
forecast ready in almost 3h, making it a possible operational tool for
providing emission profiles for external chemical transport models.

    <title>A new SATIRE-S spectral solar irradiance reconstruction for solar cycles
  21--23 and its implications for stratospheric ozone</title>
    <summary>  We present a revised and extended total and spectral solar irradiance (SSI)
reconstruction, which includes a wavelength-dependent uncertainty estimate,
spanning the last three solar cycles using the SATIRE-S model. The SSI
reconstruction covers wavelengths between 115 and 160,000 nm and all dates
between August 1974 and October 2009. This represents the first full-wavelength
SATIRE-S reconstruction to cover the last three solar cycles without data gaps
and with an uncertainty estimate. SATIRE-S is compared with the NRLSSI model
and SORCE/SOLSTICE ultraviolet (UV) observations. SATIRE-S displays similar
cycle behaviour to NRLSSI for wavelengths below 242 nm and almost twice the
variability between 242 and 310 nm. During the decline of last solar cycle,
between 2003 and 2008, SSI from SORCE/SOLSTICE version 12 and 10 typically
displays more than three times the variability of SATIRE-S between 200 and 300
nm. All three datasets are used to model changes in stratospheric ozone within
a 2D atmospheric model for a decline from high solar activity to solar minimum.
The different flux changes result in different modelled ozone trends. Using
NRLSSI leads to a decline in mesospheric ozone, while SATIRE-S and
SORCE/SOLSTICE result in an increase. Recent publications have highlighted
increases in mesospheric ozone when considering version 10 SORCE/SOLSTICE
irradiances. The recalibrated SORCE/SOLSTICE version 12 irradiances result in a
much smaller mesospheric ozone response than when using version 10 and now
similar in magnitude to SATIRE-S. This shows that current knowledge of
variations in spectral irradiance is not sufficient to warrant robust
conclusions concerning the impact of solar variability on the atmosphere and
climate.

    <title>Estimating precipitation on early Mars using a radiative-convective
  model of the atmosphere and comparison with inferred runoff from
  geomorphology</title>
    <summary>  We compare estimates of atmospheric precipitation during the Martian
Noachian-Hesperian boundary 3.8 Gyr ago as calculated in a radiative-convective
column model of the atmosphere with runoff values estimated from a
geomorphological analysis of dendritic valley network discharge rates. In the
atmospheric model, we assume CO2-H2O-N2 atmospheres with surface pressures
varying from 20 mb to 3 bar with input solar luminosity reduced to 75% the
modern value.
  Results from the valley network analysis are of the order of a few mm d-1
liquid water precipitation (1.5-10.6 mm d-1, with a median of 3.1 mm d-1).
Atmospheric model results are much lower, from about 0.001-1 mm d-1 of snowfall
(depending on CO2 partial pressure). Hence, the atmospheric model predicts a
significantly lower amount of precipitated water than estimated from the
geomorphological analysis. Furthermore, global mean surface temperatures are
below freezing, i.e. runoff is most likely not directly linked to
precipitation. Therefore, our results strongly favor a cold early Mars with
episodic snowmelt as a source for runoff.
  Our approach is challenged by mostly unconstrained parameters, e.g.
greenhouse gas abundance, global meteorology (for example, clouds) and
planetary parameters such as obliquity- which affect the atmospheric result -
as as well as by inherent problems in estimating discharge and runoff on
ancient Mars, such as a lack of knowledge on infiltration and evaporation rates
and on flooding timescales, which affect the geomorphological data.
Nevertheless, our work represents a first step in combining and interpreting
quantitative tools applied in early Mars atmospheric and geomorphological
studies.

    <title>Distinguishing cause from effect using observational data: methods and
  benchmarks</title>
    <summary>  The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational data is a
fundamental problem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal
discovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes
X, given joint observations of two variables X, Y. An example is to decide
whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint
measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of no
confounding, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal
discovery problems are challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for
addressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two
families of such methods: Additive Noise Methods (ANM) and Information
Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CauseEffectPairs
that consists of data for 100 different cause-effect pairs selected from 37
datasets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine,
engineering, economy, etc.) and motivate our decisions regarding the "ground
truth" causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several
bivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in
addition on artificially simulated data. Our empirical results on real-world
data indicate that certain methods are indeed able to distinguish cause from
effect using only purely observational data, although more benchmark data would
be needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. One of the best
performing methods overall is the additive-noise method originally proposed by
Hoyer et al. (2009), which obtains an accuracy of 63+-10 % and an AUC of
0.74+-0.05 on the real-world benchmark. As the main theoretical contribution of
this work we prove the consistency of that method.

    <title>Molecfit: A general tool for telluric absorption correction. I. Method
  and application to ESO instruments</title>
    <summary>  Context: The interaction of the light from astronomical objects with the
constituents of the Earth's atmosphere leads to the formation of telluric
absorption lines in ground-based collected spectra. Correcting for these lines,
mostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on
observations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the
science targets, therefore using precious observing time. Aims: We present
molecfit, a tool for correcting for telluric absorption lines based on
synthetic modelling of the Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is
versatile and can be used with data obtained with various ground-based
telescopes and instruments. Methods: Molecfit combines a publicly available
radiative transfer code, a molecular line database, atmospheric profiles, and
various kernels to model the instrument line spread function. The atmospheric
profiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative
of a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data, and of
dynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, and
humidity. We discuss the various ingredients of the method, its applicability,
and its limitations. We also show examples of telluric line correction on
spectra obtained with a suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.
Results: Compared to previous similar tools, molecfit takes the best results
for temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the observatory
into account. As a result, the standard deviation of the residuals after
correction of unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better than 2% of the
continuum. Conclusion: Molecfit is able to accurately model and correct for
telluric lines over a broad range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions.

    <title>Disaggregation of Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture in Heterogeneous
  Landscapes using Holistic Structure based Models</title>
    <summary>  In this study, a novel machine learning algorithm is presented for
disaggregation of satellite soil moisture (SM) based on self-regularized
regressive models (SRRM) using high-resolution correlated information from
auxiliary sources. It includes regularized clustering that assigns soft
memberships to each pixel at fine-scale followed by a kernel regression that
computes the value of the desired variable at all pixels. Coarse-scale remotely
sensed SM were disaggregated from 10km to 1km using land cover, precipitation,
land surface temperature, leaf area index, and in-situ observations of SM. This
algorithm was evaluated using multi-scale synthetic observations in NC Florida
for heterogeneous agricultural land covers. It was found that the root mean
square error (RMSE) for 96% of the pixels was less than 0.02 $m^3/m^3$. The
clusters generated represented the data well and reduced the RMSE by upto 40%
during periods of high heterogeneity in land-cover and meteorological
conditions. The Kullback Leibler divergence (KLD) between the true SM and the
disaggregated estimates is close to 0, for both vegetated and baresoil
landcovers. The disaggregated estimates were compared to those generated by the
Principle of Relevant Information (PRI) method. The RMSE for the PRI
disaggregated estimates is higher than the RMSE for the SRRM on each day of the
season. The KLD of the disaggregated estimates generated by the SRRM is at
least four orders of magnitude lower than those for the PRI disaggregated
estimates, while the computational time needed was reduced by three times. The
results indicate that the SRRM can be used for disaggregating SM with complex
non-linear correlations on a grid with high accuracy.

    <title>Stellar mixing length theory with entropy rain</title>
    <summary>  The effects of a non-gradient flux term originating from the motion of
convective elements with entropy perturbations of either sign are investigated
and incorporated into a modified version of stellar mixing length theory (MLT).
Such a term, first studied by Deardorff in the meteorological context, might
represent the effects of cold intense downdrafts caused by the rapid cooling in
the granulation layer at the top of the convection zone of late-type stars.
Such intense downdrafts were first seen in the strongly stratified simulations
of Stein &amp; Nordlund in the late 1980s. These downdrafts transport heat
nonlocally, a phenomenon referred to as entropy rain. Moreover, the Deardorff
term can cause upward enthalpy transport even in a weakly Schwarzschild-stably
stratified layer. In that case, no giant cell convection would be excited. This
is interest in view of recent observations, which could be explained if the
dominant flow structures were of small scale even at larger depths. To study
this possibility, three distinct flow structures are examined: one in which
convective structures have similar size and mutual separation at all depths,
one in which the separation increases with depth, but their size is still
unchanged, and one in which both size and separation increase with depth, which
is the standard flow structure. It is concluded that the third possibility with
fewer and thicker downdrafts in deeper layers remains most plausible, but it
may be unable to explain the suspected absence of large-scale flows with speeds
and scales expected from MLT.

    <title>Heat engines and heat pumps in a hydrostatic atmosphere: How surface
  pressure and temperature constrain wind power output and circulation cell
  size</title>
    <summary>  The kinetic energy budget of the atmosphere's meridional circulation cells is
analytically assessed. In the upper atmosphere kinetic energy generation grows
with increasing surface temperature difference \$\Delta T_s\$ between the cold
and warm ends of a circulation cell; in the lower atmosphere it declines. A
requirement that kinetic energy generation is positive in the lower atmosphere
limits the poleward cell extension \$L\$ of Hadley cells via a relationship
between \$\Delta T_s\$ and surface pressure difference \$\Delta p_s\$: an upper
limit exists when \$\Delta p_s\$ does not grow with increasing \$\Delta T_s\$.
This pattern is demonstrated here using monthly data from MERRA re-analysis.
Kinetic energy generation along air streamlines in the boundary layer does not
exceed \$40\$~J~mol\$^{-1}\$; it declines with growing \$L\$ and reaches zero
for the largest observed \$L\$ at 2~km height. The limited meridional cell size
necessitates the appearance of heat pumps -- circulation cells with negative
work output where the low-level air moves towards colder areas. These cells
consume the positive work output of the heat engines -- cells where the
low-level air moves towards the warmer areas -- and can in theory drive the
global efficiency of atmospheric circulation down to zero. Relative
contributions of \$\Delta p_s\$ and \$\Delta T_s\$ to kinetic energy generation
are evaluated: \$\Delta T_s\$ dominates in the upper atmosphere, while \$\Delta
p_s\$ dominates in the lower. Analysis and empirical evidence indicate that the
net kinetic power output on Earth is dominated by surface pressure gradients,
with minor net kinetic energy generation in the upper atmosphere. The role of
condensation in generating surface pressure gradients is discussed.

    <title>A System for Sensing Human Sentiments to Augment a Model for Predicting
  Rare Lake Events</title>
    <summary>  Fish kill events (FKE) in the caldera lake of Taal occur rarely (only 0.5\%
in the last 10 years) but each event has a long-term effect on the
environmental health of the lake ecosystem, as well as a devastating effect on
the financial and emotional aspects of the residents whose livelihood rely on
aquaculture farming. Predicting with high accuracy when within seven days and
where on the vast expanse of the lake will FKEs strike will be a very important
early warning tool for the lake's aquaculture industry. Mathematical models to
predict the occurrences of FKEs developed by several studies done in the past
use as predictors the physico-chemical characteristics of the lake water, as
well as the meteorological parameters above it. Some of the models, however,
did not provide acceptable predictive accuracy and enough early warning because
they were developed with unbalanced binary data set, i.e., characterized by
dense negative examples (no FKE) and highly sparse positive examples (with
FKE). Other models require setting up an expensive sensor network to measure
the water parameters not only at the surface but also at several depths.
Presented in this paper is a system for capturing, measuring, and visualizing
the contextual sentiment polarity (CSP) of dated and geolocated social media
microposts of residents within 10km radius of the Taal Volcano crater
($14^\circ$N, $121^\circ$E). High frequency negative CSP co-occur with FKE for
two occasions making human expressions a viable non-physical sensors for
impending FKE to augment existing mathematical models.

    <title>Further constraints on the optical transmission spectrum of HAT-P-1b</title>
    <summary>  We report on novel observations of HAT-P-1 aimed at constraining the optical
transmission spectrum of the atmosphere of its transiting Hot-Jupiter
exoplanet. Ground-based differential spectrophotometry was performed over two
transit windows using the DOLORES spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo (TNG). Our measurements imply an average planet to star radius ratio
equal to $\rm R_p/R_{\star}$=(0.1159$\pm$0.0005). This result is consistent
with the value obtained from recent near infrared measurements of this object
but differs from previously reported optical measurements being lower by around
4.4 exoplanet scale heights. Analyzing the data over 5 different spectral bins
600\AA$\,$ wide we observed a single peaked spectrum (3.7 $\rm\sigma$ level)
with a blue cut-off corresponding to the blue edge of the broad absorption wing
of sodium and an increased absorption in the region in between 6180-7400\AA. We
also infer that the width of the broad absorption wings due to alkali metals is
likely narrower than the one implied by solar abundance clear atmospheric
models. We interpret the result as evidence that HAT-P-1b has a partially clear
atmosphere at optical wavelengths with a more modest contribution from an
optical absorber than previously reported.

    <title>Reconstructing eruptive source parameters from tephra deposit: a
  numerical approach for medium-sized explosive eruptions</title>
    <summary>  Since the seventies, several reconstruction techniques have been proposed,
and are currently used, to extrapolate and quantify eruptive parameters from
sampled deposit datasets. Discrete numbers of tephra ground loadings or
stratigraphic records are usually processed to estimate source eruptive values.
Reconstruction techniques like Pyle, Power law and Weibull are adopted as
standard to quantify the erupted mass (or volume) whereas Voronoi for
reconstructing the granulometry. Reconstructed values can be affected by large
uncertainty due to complexities occurring within the atmospheric dispersion and
deposition of volcanic particles. Here we want to quantify the sensitivity of
reconstruction techniques, and to quantify how much estimated values of mass
and grain size differ from emitted and deposited ones. We adopted a numerical
approach simulating with a dispersal code a mild explosive event occurring at
Mt. Etna, with eruptive parameters similar to those estimated for eruptions
occurred in the last decade. Then we created a synthetic deposit by integrating
the mass on the ground computed by the model over the computational domain
(&gt;50000 km2). Multiple samplings of the simulated deposit are used for
generating a large dataset of sampling tests afterwards processed with standard
reconstruction techniques. Results are then compared and evaluated through a
statistical analysis, based on 2000 sampling tests of 100 samplings points. On
average, all the used techniques underestimate deposited and emitted mass. A
similar analysis, carried on Voronoi results, shows that information on the
total grain size distribution is strongly deteriorated. Here we present a new
method allowing an estimate of the deficiency in deposited mass for each
simulated class. Finally a sensitivity study on eruptive parameters is
presented in order to generalize our results to a wider range of eruptive
conditions.

    <title>Water-channel study of flow and turbulence past a two-dimensional array
  of obstacles</title>
    <summary>  A neutral boundary layer was generated in the laboratory to analyze the mean
velocity field and the turbulence field within and above an array of
two-dimensional obstacles simulating an urban canopy. Different geometrical
configurations were considered in order to investigate the main characteristics
of the flow as a function of the aspect ratio (AR) of the canopy. To this end,
a summary of the two-dimensional fields of the fundamental turbulence
parameters is given for AR ranging from 1 to 2. The results show that the flow
field depends strongly on AR only within the canyon, while the outer flow seems
to be less sensitive to this parameter. This is not true for the vertical
momentum flux, which is one of the parameters most affected by AR, both within
and outside the canyon. The experiments also indicate that, when (i.e. the
skimming flow regime), the roughness sub-layer extends up to a height equal to
1.25 times the height of the obstacles (H), surmounted by an inertial sub-layer
that extends up to 2.7 H. In contrast, for (i.e. the wake-interference regime)
the inertial sub-layer is not present. This has significant implications when
using similarity laws for deriving wind and turbulence profiles in canopy
flows. Furthermore, two estimations of the viscous dissipation rate of
turbulent kinetic energy of the flow are given. The first one is based on the
fluctuating strain rate tensor, while the second is related to the mean strain
rate tensor. It is shown that the two expressions give similar results, but the
former is more complicated, suggesting that the latter might be used in
numerical models with a certain degree of reliability. Finally, the data
presented can also be used as a dataset for the validation of numerical models.

    <title>Data assimilation for massive autonomous systems based on second-order
  adjoint method</title>
    <summary>  Data assimilation (DA) is a fundamental computational technique that
integrates numerical simulation models and observation data on the basis of
Bayesian statistics. Originally developed for meteorology, especially weather
forecasting, DA is now an accepted technique in various scientific fields. One
key issue that remains controversial is the implementation of DA in massive
simulation models under limited computation time and resources. In this paper,
we propose an adjoint-based DA method for massive autonomous models that
produces optimum estimates and their uncertainties within practical computation
time and resource constraints. The uncertainties are given as several diagonal
components of an inverse Hessian matrix, which is the covariance matrix of a
normal distribution that approximates the target posterior probability density
function in the neighborhood of the optimum. Conventional algorithms for
deriving the inverse Hessian matrix require $O(CN^2+N^3)$ computations and
$O(N^2)$ memory, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom of a given
autonomous system and $C$ is the number of computations needed to simulate time
series of suitable length. The proposed method using a second-order adjoint
method allows us to directly evaluate the diagonal components of the inverse
Hessian matrix without computing all of its components. This drastically
reduces the number of computations to $O(C)$ and the amount of memory to $O(N)$
for each diagonal component. The proposed method is validated through numerical
tests using a massive two-dimensional Kobayashi's phase-field model. We confirm
that the proposed method correctly reproduces the parameter and initial state
assumed in advance, and successfully evaluates the uncertainty of the
parameter. Such information regarding uncertainty is valuable, as it can be
used to optimize the design of experiments.

    <title>Record breaking bursts during the compressive failure of porous
  materials</title>
    <summary>  An accurate understanding of the interplay between random and deterministic
processes in generating extreme events is of critical importance in many
fields, from forecasting extreme meteorological events to the catastrophic
failure of materials and in the Earth. Here we investigate the statistics of
record-breaking events in the time series of crackling noise generated by local
rupture events during the compressive failure of porous materials. The events
are generated by computer simulations of the uni-axial compression of
cylindrical samples in a discrete element model of sedimentary rocks that
closely resemble those of real experiments. The number of records grows
initially as a decelerating power law of the number of events, followed by an
acceleration immediately prior to failure. We demonstrate the existence of a
characteristic record rank k^* which separates the two regimes of the time
evolution. Up to this rank deceleration occurs due to the effect of random
disorder. Record breaking then accelerates towards macroscopic failure, when
physical interactions leading to spatial and temporal correlations dominate the
location and timing of local ruptures. Sub-sequences of bursts between
consecutive records are characterized by a power law size distribution with an
exponent which decreases as failure is approached. High rank records are
preceded by bursts of increasing size and waiting time between consecutive
events and they are followed by a relaxation process. As a reference, surrogate
time series are generated by reshuffling the crackling bursts. The record
statistics of the uncorrelated surrogates agrees very well with the
corresponding predictions of independent identically distributed random
variables, which confirms that the temporal and spatial correlation of cracking
bursts are responsible for the observed unique behaviour.

    <title>A Bayesian Network approach to County-Level Corn Yield Prediction using
  historical data and expert knowledge</title>
    <summary>  Crop yield forecasting is the methodology of predicting crop yields prior to
harvest. The availability of accurate yield prediction frameworks have enormous
implications from multiple standpoints, including impact on the crop commodity
futures markets, formulation of agricultural policy, as well as crop insurance
rating. The focus of this work is to construct a corn yield predictor at the
county scale. Corn yield (forecasting) depends on a complex, interconnected set
of variables that include economic, agricultural, management and meteorological
factors. Conventional forecasting is either knowledge-based computer programs
(that simulate plant-weather-soil-management interactions) coupled with
targeted surveys or statistical model based. The former is limited by the need
for painstaking calibration, while the latter is limited to univariate analysis
or similar simplifying assumptions that fail to capture the complex
interdependencies affecting yield. In this paper, we propose a data-driven
approach that is "gray box" i.e. that seamlessly utilizes expert knowledge in
constructing a statistical network model for corn yield forecasting. Our
multivariate gray box model is developed on Bayesian network analysis to build
a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) between predictors and yield. Starting from a
complete graph connecting various carefully chosen variables and yield, expert
knowledge is used to prune or strengthen edges connecting variables.
Subsequently the structure (connectivity and edge weights) of the DAG that
maximizes the likelihood of observing the training data is identified via
optimization. We curated an extensive set of historical data (1948-2012) for
each of the 99 counties in Iowa as data to train the model.

    <title>A Comparison of Flare Forecasting Methods, I: Results from the
  "All-Clear" Workshop</title>
    <summary>  Solar flares produce radiation which can have an almost immediate effect on
the near-Earth environment, making it crucial to forecast flares in order to
mitigate their negative effects. The number of published approaches to flare
forecasting using photospheric magnetic field observations has proliferated,
with varying claims about how well each works. Because of the different
analysis techniques and data sets used, it is essentially impossible to compare
the results from the literature. This problem is exacerbated by the low event
rates of large solar flares. The challenges of forecasting rare events have
long been recognized in the meteorology community, but have yet to be fully
acknowledged by the space weather community. During the interagency workshop on
"all clear" forecasts held in Boulder, CO in 2009, the performance of a number
of existing algorithms was compared on common data sets, specifically
line-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity images from MDI, with
consistent definitions of what constitutes an event. We demonstrate the
importance of making such systematic comparisons, and of using standard
verification statistics to determine what constitutes a good prediction scheme.
When a comparison was made in this fashion, no one method clearly outperformed
all others, which may in part be due to the strong correlations among the
parameters used by different methods to characterize an active region. For
M-class flares and above, the set of methods tends towards a weakly positive
skill score (as measured with several distinct metrics), with no participating
method proving substantially better than climatological forecasts.

    <title>A Machine Learning Nowcasting Method based on Real-time Reanalysis Data</title>
    <summary>  Despite marked progress over the past several decades, convective storm
nowcasting remains a challenge because most nowcasting systems are based on
linear extrapolation of radar reflectivity without much consideration for other
meteorological fields. The variational Doppler radar analysis system (VDRAS) is
an advanced convective-scale analysis system capable of providing analysis of
3-D wind, temperature, and humidity by assimilating Doppler radar observations.
Although potentially useful, it is still an open question as to how to use
these fields to improve nowcasting. In this study, we present results from our
first attempt at developing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Box-based nOWcasting
(SBOW) method under the machine learning framework using VDRAS analysis data.
The key design points of SBOW are as follows: 1) The study domain is divided
into many position-fixed small boxes and the nowcasting problem is transformed
into one question, i.e., will a radar echo &gt; 35 dBZ appear in a box in 30
minutes? 2) Box-based temporal and spatial features, which include time trends
and surrounding environmental information, are elaborately constructed, and 3)
The box-based constructed features are used to first train the SVM classifier,
and then the trained classifier is used to make predictions. Compared with
complicated and expensive expert systems, the above design of SBOW allows the
system to be small, compact, straightforward, and easy to maintain and expand
at low cost. The experimental results show that, although no complicated
tracking algorithm is used, SBOW can predict the storm movement trend and storm
growth with reasonable skill.

    <title>Analysis of antenna position measurements and weather station network
  data during the ALMA Long Baseline Campaign of 2015</title>
    <summary>  In a radio interferometer, the determination of geometrical antenna positions
relies on accurate calibration of the dry and wet delay of the atmosphere above
each antenna. For the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA),
which has baseline lengths up to 16 kilometers, the geography of the site
forces the height above mean sea level of the more distant antenna pads to be
significantly lower than the central array. Thus, both the ground level
meteorological values and the total water column can be quite different between
antennas in the extended configurations. During 2015, a network of six
additional weather stations was installed to monitor pressure, temperature,
relative humidity and wind velocity, in order to test whether inclusion of
these parameters could improve the repeatability of antenna position
determinations in these configurations. We present an analysis of the data
obtained during the ALMA Long Baseline Campaign of Oct. through Nov. 2015. The
repeatability of antenna position measurements typically degrades as a function
of antenna distance. Also, the scatter is more than three times worse in the
vertical direction than in the local tangent plane, suggesting that a
systematic effect is limiting the measurements. So far we have explored
correcting the delay model for deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium in the
measured air pressure and separating the partial pressure of water from the
total pressure using water vapor radiometer (WVR) data. Correcting for these
combined effects still does not provide a good match to the residual position
errors in the vertical direction. One hypothesis is that the current model of
water vapor may be too simple to fully remove the day-to-day variations in the
wet delay. We describe possible avenues of improvement, including measuring and
applying more accurate values of the sky coupling efficiency of the WVRs.

    <title>Dimension Splitting and a Long Time-Step Multi-Dimensional Scheme for
  Atmospheric Transport</title>
    <summary>  Dimensionally split advection schemes are attractive for atmospheric
modelling due to their efficiency and accuracy in each spatial dimension.
Accurate long time-steps can be achieved without significant cost using the
flux-form semi-Lagrangian technique. The dimensionally split scheme used here
is constructed from the one-dimensional Piecewise Parabolic Method and extended
to two dimensions using COSMIC splitting. The dimensionally split scheme is
compared with a genuinely multi-dimensional, method of lines scheme with
implicit time-stepping which is stable for large Courant numbers.
  Two-dimensional advection test cases on Cartesian planes are proposed that
avoid the complexities of a spherical domain or multi-panel meshes. These are
solid body rotation, horizontal advection over orography and deformational
flow. The test cases use distorted meshes either to represent sloping terrain
or to mimic the distortions of a cubed sphere.
  Such mesh distortions are expected to accentuate the errors associated with
dimension splitting, however, the dimensionally split scheme is very accurate
on orthogonal meshes and accuracy decreases only a little in the presence of
large mesh distortions. The dimensionally split scheme also loses some accuracy
when long time-steps are used. The multi-dimensional scheme is almost entirely
insensitive to mesh distortions and asymptotes to second-order accuracy at high
resolution. As is expected for implicit time-stepping, phase errors occur when
using long time-steps but the spatially well resolved features are advected at
the correct speed and the multi-dimensional scheme is always stable.
  An estimate of computational cost reveals that the implicit scheme is the
most expensive, particularly for large Courant numbers. If the
multi-dimensional scheme is used instead with explicit time-stepping, the cost
becomes similar to the dimensionally split scheme.

    <title>Vertical Bifacial Solar Farms: Physics, Design, and Global Optimization</title>
    <summary>  There have been sustained interest in bifacial solar cell technology since
1980s, with prospects of 30-50% increase in the output power from a stand-alone
single panel. Moreover, a vertical bifacial panel reduces dust accumulation and
provides two output peaks during the day, with the second peak aligned to the
peak electricity demand. Recent commercialization and anticipated growth of
bifacial panel market have encouraged a closer scrutiny of the integrated
power-output and economic viability of bifacial solar farms, where mutual
shading will erode some of the anticipated energy gain associated with an
isolated, single panel. Towards that goal, in this paper we focus on
geography-specific optimizations of ground mounted vertical bifacial solar
farms for the entire world. For local irradiance, we combine the measured
meteorological data with the clear-sky model. In addition, we consider the
detailed effects of direct, diffuse, and albedo light. We assume the panel is
configured into sub-strings with bypass-diodes. Based on calculated light
collection and panel output, we analyze the optimum farm design for maximum
yearly output at any given location in the world. Our results predict that,
regardless of the geographical location, a vertical bifacial farm will yield
10-20% more energy than a traditional monofacial farm for a practical
row-spacing of 2m (1.2m high panels). With the prospect of additional 5-20%
energy gain from reduced soiling and tilt optimization, bifacial solar farm do
offer a viable technology option for large-scale solar energy generation.

    <title>Lithium depletion in solar-like stars: effect of overshooting based on
  realistic multi-dimensional simulations</title>
    <summary>  We study lithium depletion in low-mass and solar-like stars as a function of
time, using a new diffusion coefficient describing extra-mixing taking place at
the bottom of a convective envelope. This new form is motivated by
multi-dimensional fully compressible, time implicit hydrodynamic simulations
performed with the MUSIC code. Intermittent convective mixing at the convective
boundary in a star can be modeled using extreme value theory, a statistical
analysis frequently used for finance, meteorology, and environmental science.
In this letter, we implement this statistical diffusion coefficient in a
one-dimensional stellar evolution code, using parameters calibrated from
multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a young low-mass star. We propose
a new scenario that can explain observations of the surface abundance of
lithium in the Sun and in clusters covering a wide range of ages, from $\sim$
50 Myr to $\sim$ 4 Gyr. Because it relies on our physical model of convective
penetration, this scenario has a limited number of assumptions. It can explain
the observed trend between rotation and depletion, based on a single additional
assumption, namely that rotation affects the mixing efficiency at the
convective boundary. We suggest the existence of a threshold in stellar
rotation rate above which rotation strongly prevents the vertical penetration
of plumes and below which rotation has small effects. In addition to providing
a possible explanation for the long standing problem of lithium depletion in
pre-main sequence and main sequence stars, the strength of our scenario is that
its basic assumptions can be tested by future hydrodynamic simulations.

    <title>Tibet's Ali: A New Window to Detect the CMB Polarization</title>
    <summary>  The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Polarization plays an important role in
current cosmological studies. CMB B-mode polarization is the most effective
probe to primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) and a test of the inflation as
well as other theories of the early universe such as bouncing and cyclic
universe. So far, major ground-based CMB polarization experiments are located
in the southern hemisphere.Recently, China has launched the Ali CMB
Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) in Tibetan Plateau to measure CMB B mode
polarization and detect the PGWs in northern hemisphere. AliCPT include two
stages, the first one is to build a telescope at the 5250m site (AliCPT-1) and
the second one is to have a more sensitive telescope at a higher altitude of
about 6000m (AliCPT-2). In this paper, we report the atmospherical conditions,
sky coverage and the current infrastructure associated with AliCPT. We analyzed
the reanalysis data from MERRA-2 together with radiosonde data from the Ali
Meteorological Service and found that the amount of water vapor has a heavy
seasonal variation and October to March is the suitable observation time. We
also found 95/150 GHz to be feasible for AliCPT-1 and higher frequencies to be
possible for AliCPT-2. Then we analyzed the observable sky and the target
fields, and showed that Ali provides us a unique opportunity to observe CMB
with less foreground contamination in the northern hemisphere and is
complementary to the existed southern CMB experiments. Together with the
developed infrastructure, we point out that Ali opens a new window for CMB
observation and will be one of the major sites in the world along with
Antarctic and Atacama.

    <title>The Arctic Ocean seasonal cycles of heat and freshwater fluxes:
  observation-based inverse estimates</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents the first estimate of the seasonal cycle of ocean and sea
ice net heat and freshwater (FW) fluxes around the boundary of the Arctic
Ocean. The ocean transports are estimated primarily using 138 moored
instruments deployed in September 2005 to August 2006 across the four main
Arctic gateways: Davis, Fram and Bering Straits, and the Barents Sea Opening
(BSO). Sea ice transports are estimated from a sea ice assimilation product.
Monthly velocity fields are calculated with a box inverse model that enforces
volume and salinity conservation. The resulting net ocean and sea ice heat and
FW fluxes (annual mean $\pm$ 1 standard deviation) are 175 $\pm$48 TW and 204
$\pm$85 mSv (respectively; 1 Sv = 10$^{6} m^{3} s^{-1}$). These boundary fluxes
accurately represent the annual means of the relevant surface fluxes. Oceanic
net heat transport variability is driven by temperature variability in upper
part of the water column and by volume transport variability in the Atlantic
Water layer. Oceanic net FW transport variability is dominated by Bering Strait
velocity variability. The net water mass transformation in the Arctic entails a
freshening and cooling of inflowing waters by 0.62$\pm$0.23 in salinity and
3.74$\pm$0.76C in temperature, respectively, and a reduction in density by
0.23$\pm$0.20 kg m$^{-3}$. The volume transport into the Arctic of waters
associated with this water mass transformation is 11.3$\pm$1.2 Sv, and the
export is -11.4$\pm$1.1 Sv. The boundary heat and FW fluxes provide a benchmark
data set for the validation of numerical models and atmospheric re-analyses
products.

    <title>Reproducible Floating-Point Aggregation in RDBMSs</title>
    <summary>  Industry-grade database systems are expected to produce the same result if
the same query is repeatedly run on the same input. However, the numerous
sources of non-determinism in modern systems make reproducible results
difficult to achieve. This is particularly true if floating-point numbers are
involved, where the order of the operations affects the final result.
  As part of a larger effort to extend database engines with data
representations more suitable for machine learning and scientific applications,
in this paper we explore the problem of making relational GroupBy over
floating-point formats bit-reproducible, i.e., ensuring any execution of the
operator produces the same result up to every single bit. To that aim, we first
propose a numeric data type that can be used as drop-in replacement for other
number formats and is---unlike standard floating-point formats---associative.
We use this data type to make state-of-the-art GroupBy operators reproducible,
but this approach incurs a slowdown between 4x and 12x compared to the same
operator using conventional database number formats. We thus explore how to
modify existing GroupBy algorithms to make them bit-reproducible and efficient.
By using vectorized summation on batches and carefully balancing batch size,
cache footprint, and preprocessing costs, we are able to reduce the slowdown
due to reproducibility to a factor between 1.9x and 2.4x of aggregation in
isolation and to a mere 2.7% of end-to-end query performance even on
aggregation-intensive queries in MonetDB. We thereby provide a solid basis for
supporting more reproducible operations directly in relational engines.
  This document is an extended version of an article currently in print for the
proceedings of ICDE'18 with the same title and by the same authors. The main
additions are more implementation details and experiments.

    <title>Manganese in the West Atlantic Ocean in context of the first global
  ocean circulation model of manganese</title>
    <summary>  Dissolved manganese (Mn) is a biologically essential element, and its
oxidised form is involved in the removal of trace elements from ocean waters.
Recently, a large number of highly accurate Mn measurements have been obtained
in the Atlantic, Indian and Arctic Oceans as part of the GEOTRACES programme.
The goal of this study is to combine these new observations with
state-of-the-art modelling to give new insights into the main sources and
redistribution of Mn throughout the ocean. To this end, we simulate the
distribution of dissolved Mn using a global-scale circulation model. This first
model includes simple parameterisations to account, realistically, for the
sources, processes and sinks of Mn in the ocean. Whereas oxidation and
(photo)reduction, as well as aggregation and settling are parameterised in the
model, biological uptake is not yet taken into account by the model. Our model
reproduces observations accurately and provides the following insights:
  - The high surface concentrations of manganese are caused by the combination
of photoreduction and sources to the upper ocean. The most important sources
are dust, then sediments, and, more locally, rivers.
  - Results show that surface Mn in the Atlantic Ocean moves downwards into the
North Atlantic Deep Water, but because of strong removal rates the Mn does not
propagate southwards.
  - There is a mostly homogeneous background concentration of dissolved Mn of
about 0.10 to 0.15 nM throughout most of the deep ocean. The model reproduces
this by means of a threshold on manganese oxides of 25 pM, suggesting that a
minimal concentration of Mn is needed before aggregation and removal become
efficient.
  - The observed sharp hydrothermal signals are produced by assuming both a
high source and a strong removal of Mn near hydrothermal vents.

    <title>Description of Atmospheric Conditions at the Pierre Auger Observatory
  using the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)</title>
    <summary>  Atmospheric conditions at the site of a cosmic ray observatory must be known
for reconstructing observed extensive air showers. The Global Data Assimilation
System (GDAS) is a global atmospheric model predicated on meteorological
measurements and numerical weather predictions. GDAS provides
altitude-dependent profiles of the main state variables of the atmosphere like
temperature, pressure, and humidity. The original data and their application to
the air shower reconstruction of the Pierre Auger Observatory are described. By
comparisons with radiosonde and weather station measurements obtained on-site
in Malarg\"ue and averaged monthly models, the utility of the GDAS data is
shown.
