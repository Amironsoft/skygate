Summary 
One  of  the  biggest  practical  problems  with  the  optimization  of  shale  gas  stimulation  design  is  estimating  post-fracture 
production  rate,  production  decline,  and  ultimate  recovery.  Without  a  realistic  prediction  of  the  production  decline  trend 
resulting  from  a  given  completion  and  reservoir  properties,  it  is  impossible  to  evaluate  the  economic  viability  of  producing 
natural gas from shale plays.  

Traditionally, decline curve analysis (DCA) is commonly used to predict gas production and its decline trend to determine the 
estimated  ultimate  recovery  (EUR),  but  its  analysis  cannot  be  used  to  analyze  what  factors  influence  the  production  decline 
trend  due  to  lack  of  underlying  support  of  physics,  which  make  it  difficult  to  guide  completion  designs  or  optimize  field 
development. 

In this article, we presented a unified shale gas reservoir model, which incorporates real gas transport, nano-flow mechanisms 
and  geomechanics  into  fractured  shale  system.  This  model  is  used  to  predict  shale  gas  production  under  different  reservoir 
scenarios and investigate  what factors control its  decline trend. The results and analysis presented in the article provide us a 
better  understanding  of  gas  production  and  decline  mechanisms  in  a  shale  gas  well  with  certain  conditions  of  the  reservoir 
characteristics.  More  in-depth  knowledge  regarding  the  effects  of  factors  controlling  the  behavior  of  the  gas  production  can 
help us develop more reliable models to forecast shale gas decline trend and ultimate recovery. This article also reveals that 
some  commonly  hold  beliefs  may  sound  reasonable  to  infer  production  decline  trend,  but  may  not  be  true  in  a  coupled 
reservoir system in reality.  

Introduction 
With  ever  increasing  demanding  for  cleaner  energy,  unconventional  gas  reservoirs  are  expected  to  play  a  vital  role  in 
satisfying the global needs for gas in the future. The major component of unconventional gas reservoirs comprises of shale gas. 
Shales and silts are the most abundant sedimentary rocks in the earth‚Äôs crust and it is evident from the recent year‚Äôs activities 
in shale gas plays that in the future shale gas will constitute the largest component in gas production globally, as conventional 
reservoirs continue declines (Energy  Information  Administration 2015). According to  GSGI, there are  more than 688  shales 
worldwide in 142 basins and 48 major shale basins are located in 32 countries (Newell 2011). Better reservoir knowledge and 
advancing horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies make the production of shale gas resources economically 
viable and more efficient.  

Unlike conventional reservoirs, the shale gas reservoirs tend to be more expensive to develop and require special technologies 
to  enable  the  gas  to  be  produced  at  an  economical  rate  due  to  its  extremely  low  matrix  permeability  and  porosity.  Thus 
modeling the shale gas production and its declines correctly is essential to predict how fast the gas can be produced and turned 
into revenue from each well, and the economic viability of producing natural gas from the operated shale plays. Fig.1 shows 
the average gas production rate per well, for wells that grouped by their first production date in different shale basin across the 
United States. It can be observed that gas production rate declines rapidly within the first a few months of production. We can 
also notice that the peak of production rate does not occur in the first month, this is because early time production are affected 
by wellbore clean-up effects, when gas are produced with water and fracturing fluids.

The  estimated  ultimate  recovery  (EUR)  of  shale  gas  wells  has  been  forecasted  in  a  number  of  ways  within  the  industry, 
primarily  based  on  initial  production  rates  (IPs)  and  decline  trends.  The  decline  curve  analysis  (DCA)  is  probably  the  most

frequently  used  production  forecasting  tool  for  shale  gas  reservoirs  due  to  its  relative  simplicity  and  speed.  The  common 
methods  used  to  estimate  oil  and  gas  reserves  rely  on  a  set  of  empirical  production  decline  curves  based  on  the  following 
hyperbolic function (Arps 1945):  

ùëûùë° = ùëûùëñ(1 + ùëèùê∑ùëñùë°)

‚àí1
ùëè  

where ùëûùë° is the production rate at time t, ùëûùëñ is the initial production rate at time t = 0, ùê∑ùëñ and ùëè are two constants (the former is 
the initial rate of decline in production and ùëè is the rate of change in ùê∑ùëñ over time, which control the curvature of the decline 
trend). 

The Arps equation was designed for conventional reservoirs where the boundary-dominated flow is the norm. However, shale 
gas reservoirs are characterized by transient production behavior and in general boundary-dominated flow only occurs in later 
times. Shale  gas production rates generally  have steep initial decline trends and  gradually  flatten out (also shown in  Fig. 1). 
The  resulting  DCA  can  often  yield  b  values  greater  than  1.0.  This  not  only  gives  higher  EUR  values,  but  also  leads  to  an 
extrapolation  of  infinite  EUR.  When  this  occurs,  production  decline  curve  must  be  converted  to  another  type  of  function  at 
some point so as to restrict the EUR to be finite. In addition, the Arps model has too few freely adjustable parameters to fit the 
data fully, so biased and subjective extrapolation could be off the accepted range (e.g., during early well productions, models 
with vastly different b values all look similar). The differences only show up in the long-term, leading to vastly different EUR 
values. 

The flaws in Arps model has led to the development of many new DCA models for predicting estimated EUR in the shale gas 
wells,  such  as  the  power  law  exponential  model  (Ilk  et  al.  2008),  logistic  growth  analysis  (Clark  et  al.  2011)  and  Duong‚Äôs 
model (Duong 2011), etc. Even though all these models were formulated differently, they are all empirical equations and lack 
of underlying support of physics, so the same production data may lead to different estimation of EUR and production decline 
trend, with different practice of tuning parameters. Moreover, shale has very distinct characteristics even it lays next to each 
other in the same area, and decline rate may differ from stage to stage, well to well (King 2010), thus make it impossible to 
extrapolate the results of DCA model from one well to another.   

In  general,  few  shale  wells  have  gone  through  whole  life  cycles,  and  there  are  significant  uncertainties  that  associated  with 
different decline models when trying to estimate the volume of technically recoverable reserves. Since production decline most 
dramatically in the first a few years and the economically preferred completion designs may be more driven by the net present 
value derived in the Ô¨Årst 5 years of production rather than the ultimate recovery of the well (Barree et al. 2015). This early 5-
year  period  that  represents  most  of  the  useful  economic  life  of  the  well,  is  hard  to  predict  with  enough  confidence  using 
empirical models due to short of production data. In addition, empirical models cannot be used to analyze what factors cause 
the shift of production decline curve in field cases with different practices, which makes it impossible to assign value to one 
design  over  another  and  equally  impossible  to  optimize  the  treatment  for  whichever  goal  is  sought,  either  acceleration  of 
recovery or increase in reserves. 

A better understanding of gas production and its decline trend in a shale gas well, in particular, regions with certain conditions 
of  the  reservoir  characteristics,  will  give  a  better  insight  of  whether  the  DCA  model  used  is  appropriate.  More  in-depth 
knowledge regarding the effects of factors controlling the behavior of the production decline can help us develop more reliable 
models to forecast shale gas production, decline trend and ultimate recovery. In this study, a unified shale gas reservoir model 
is used to investigate what factors control shale gas production and its decline trend in a systematic manner. The results of this 
study provide us a comprehensive  understanding of the correlations  between  various factors and production decline trend in 
hydraulic fractured, horizontal gas wells.  

The  structure  of  this  article  is  as  follows.  First,  some  unique  characteristics  that  influence  shale  gas  production  and  decline 
trend  are  reviewed  and  discussed.  Next,  a  unified  reservoir  model  is  used  to  predict  the  long-term  well  performance  of 
hydraulically  fractured  wells  under  different  reservoir  in-situ  conditions.  Then,  the  simulation  results  are  analyzed  and 
compared  to  examine  what  factors  mostly  control  shale  gas  production  and  decline  trend.  Finally,  conclusion  remarks  and 
discussions are presented. The proposed mathematical framework for unified shale gas reservoir modeling, which incorporates 
real gas transport, nano-flow mechanisms and geomechanics into fractured shale system, is presented in Appendix. 

Shale Gas Production and Physical Mechanisms  
In  this  section,  some  important  mechanisms  that  may  control  shale  gas  production  and  decline  trend  are  presented  and 
discussed, those factors and their coupled effects on the overall horizontal gas well performance will be examined extensively 
throughout this article. 

Adsorption Gas  

In shale gas reservoirs, gas can be stored as compressed fluid inside the pores or it can be adsorbed by the solid matrix. The 
gas adsorption in  shale-gas system is primarily controlled by the presence of organic  matter and the gas adsorption capacity 
depends on TOC (Total Organic Carbon), organic matter type, thermal maturity and clay minerals. Generally, the higher the 
TOC content, the greater the gas adsorption capacity. In addition, a large number of nanopores lead to significant nanoporosity 
in  shale  formations,  which  increases  the  gas  adsorption  surface  area  substantially  (Javadpour  et  al.  2007).  The  amount  of 
adsorbed  gas  varies  from  35-58%  (Barnett  Shale,  USA)  up  to  60-85%  (Lewis  Shale,  USA)  of  total  gas  initial  in-place 

(Darishchev  et  al.  2013).  Fig.  2  shows  laboratory  measurement  of  gas  adsorption  capacity  from  a  shale  sample  at  different 
temperatures.  It  can  be  observed  that  the  reservoir  pressure  must  be  sufficiently  low  to  liberate  the  adsorbed  gas.  For 
organically rich shales, the ultimately recoverable amount of gas is largely a function of the adsorbed gas that can be released 
(desorbed). Because most adsorbed gas can only be released at low reservoir pressure, due to the extremely low permeability 
of  shale  matrix,  even  with  hydraulic  fracturing,  there  is  still  significant  amount  of  residual  absorption  gas  that  cannot  be 
produced, unless additional stimulation methods are used, such as thermal stimulation (Wang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2015a; 
Yue et al. 2015). Understanding the effects that initial adsorption, and moreover, desorption has on gas production and decline 
trend will increase the effectiveness of reservoir management and economic evaluations.

Matrix Apparent Permeability and Its Evolution 

 

Darcy‚Äôs  equation,  which  models  pressure-driven  viscous  flow,  works  properly  for  reservoirs  where  continuum  theory  holds 
and fluid velocity can be assumed to be zero at the pore wall (Sherman 1969). However, in shale reservoirs which have pore 
throat  radii  in  the  range  of  nanometers,  fluid  continuum  theory  breaks  down  and  gas  molecules  follow  a  somewhat  random 
path while still maintaining a general flow direction governed by the pressure gradient. Molecules strike against the pore walls 
and tend to slip at pore walls instead of having zero velocity. In order to propose corrections for non-Darcy flow over different 
flow regions in nanopore space, numerous authors (Civan 2010; Darabi et al. 2012; Fathi et al. 2012; Sakhaee-Pour and Bryant 
2012;  Singh  et  al.  2014)  have  quantified  these  effects  by  modifying  the  slippage  factor   or  determining  the  apparent 
permeability as a function of Knudsen number.  

Even  though  numerous  theoretical  and  empirical  models  have  been  developed  for  apparent  permeability  enhancement  in 
nanopore  structures,  to  account  for  the  effects  of  non-Darcy  flow/gas-slippage  behavior,  they  ignore  the  changes  in  pore 
structure geometry induced by stress variations and the release of the adsorption gas layer during production. The assumption 
of constant pore radius is valid under steady-state flow, however, within these ranges of ultralow permeability, transient and 
pseudo-steady-state flow dominate the entire production life of shale formations. With constant decreasing pore pressure and 
increasing  effective  stress,  the  formation  microstructure  will  be  affected.  Wang  and  Marongiu-Porcu  (2015)  presented  a 
comprehensive  literature  review  on  the  evolution  of  matrix  permeability  during  pressure  depletion  and  proposed  a  unified 
matrix permeability model which incorporates the mechanisms of non-Darcy flow/Gas-Slippage, the release of the adsorption 
gas layer and geomechanical effects into a coherent global model, as shown in Fig.  3. Their works indicate that despite rock 
compaction, the apparent permeability in shale matrix increases  during production due to the combined effects of  non-Darcy 
flow/gas-slippage  and  release  of  the  adsorption  gas  layer.  The  evolution  of  matrix  permeability  as  reservoir  pore  pressure 
declines can also make a difference in determining gas production rate. In this article, a more general formula for global shale 
matrix permeability evolution is implemented in the model and will be presented in Appendix.

Fracture Networks and Pressure/Stress-Dependent Conductivity 

Many  field  experiments  demonstrated  that  a  propagating  hydraulic  fracture  encountering  natural  fractures  may  lead  to  the 

 

arrest  of  fracture  propagation,  fluid  flow  into  natural  fracture,  the  creation  of  multiple  fractures  and  fracture  offsets.  Under 
some specific stress conditions and the perturbations of hydraulic fracturing, the natural fractures may coalesce to form very 
conductive, larger scale channels and completely change the formation rock flow properties. Now it is a well-known fact that 
most  brittle  shale  formations  have  massive  pre-existing  natural  fracture  networks  that  are  generally  sealed  by  precipitated 
materials  weakly  bonded  with  mineralization.  Such  poorly  sealed  natural  fractures  can  interact  heavily  with  the  hydraulic 
fractures during the injection treatments, serving as preferential paths for the growth of complex fracture network (Cipolla et 
al. 2011; Zakhour et al. 2015). However, the permeability/conductivity of the fracture networks (include both propped and un-
propped  fractures)  is  a  function  of  confining  stress,  fluid  and  proppant  type  for  a  specific  reservoir  (Fredd  et  al.  2000; 
Ghassemi  and  Suarez-Rivera  2012).  Laboratory  experiment  can  be  used  to  determine  the  expected  reduction  in  fracture 
conductivity  caused  by  the  increasing  effective  stress  by  using  correlations  (Cho  et  al.  2013).  The  reduction  of  fracture 
conductivity due to proppant/asperities crash or embedment, when fluid pressure declines in the fracture system, can strongly 
influence the efficiency of the fracture networks and gas production rate.  

Non-Stimulated Reservoir Volume  

The interaction between pre-existing natural fractures and the advancing hydraulic fracture is a key issue leading to complex 
fracture  patterns.  Large  populations  of  natural  fractures  are  sealed  by  precipitated  cement  which  is  weakly  bonded  with 
mineralization  that  even  if  there  is  no  porosity  in  the  sealed  fractures,  they  may  still  serve  as  weak  paths  for  the  growing 
hydraulic  fractures.  Even  if  the  proppant  material  cannot  reach  a  certain  branch  of  the  network,  or  even  if  the  branch  is  not 
connected  to  the  perforations,  the  slippage  caused  residual  opening  or  some  other  type  of  ‚Äúrock  failure‚Äù  provides  increased 
flow capacity within its vicinity. The observations of fracture complexity have led to the introduction of Stimulated Reservoir 
Volume  (SRV),  which  is  used  to  describe  the  shape  and  size  of  a  fracture  network  created  by  hydraulic  fracturing  in  low-
permeability  reservoirs.  SRV  is  considered  as  an  important  parameter  for  well  performance  in  low  permeability  reservoirs 
because  their  productivity  depends  primarily  on  enhanced  permeability  of  the  SRV  and  the  reservoir  area  contacted  by  the 
SRV (Jackson et al. 2013; Palmer et al. 2014; Suliman et al. 2013). 

When  the  fracture  spacing  design  is  not  optimized  (e.g.,  a  large  number  of  tightly  spaced  perforation  clusters  are 
simultaneously  propagating  fractures),  the  stress  interference  may  prohibit  some  fractures  from  growing  (Shin  and  Sharma 
2014). Field study (Minner et al. 2003) also indicates that 80% fracture volume created at the heel and toe of a horizontal well 
and  only  20%  fracture  volume  created  at  the  mid-lateral,  due  to  poor  stimulation  design.  If  rock  property  is  heterogeneous 
along the horizontal wellbore, fractures may only grow in brittle sections and leave the ductile sections unstimulated, because 
lower pressure is needed to initiate and propagate in brittle rocks (Wang 2015; Wang 2016b; Wang et al. 2016). Sub-optimal 
hydraulic fracture design and reservoir heterogeneity may lead to large reservoir volume unstimulated. The reservoir volumes, 
that are not overlapped by SRV and remain its original flow capacity,  will be classified and investigated as Non-SRV in the 
following sections. 

Numerical Modeling and Base Case Simulation  

In  order  to  investigate  the  impact  of  various  mechanisms  on  shale  gas  production  process,  a  unified  shale  gas  reservoir 
simulator is developed. The fully coupled physical process implemented involves fluid flow within the formation matrix and 
fractures,  shale  gas  adsorption  and  desorption,  real  gas  properties  and  in-situ  stress  that  changes  dynamically  during 
production. This state of the art simulator enables us to investigate what factors have the most influential impact on the global 
well  performance  and  ultimate  recovery  in  shale  gas  formations,  by  combining  real-gas  nano-flow  mechanisms  and 
geomechanical  effects  in  fracture  systems.  For  easy  interpretation  and  generality  of  analysis,  wellbore  clean-up  process  will 
not be modeled and discussed in this study.  

Even  though  it  is  possible  to  simulate  a  complete  section  of  a  horizontal  well  with  multiple  transverse  fractures,  it  is  more 
efficient to simulate a unit stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and apply symmetric boundary conditions along the boundaries, 
and then the total gas production from a horizontal well can be determined by adding the contributions from each SRV unit.  
Fig. 4 shows the plane view of SRV unit with a hydraulic fracture that penetrates into the formation  from the horizontal well 
bore  and  intercepts  by  abundant  natural  fractures  (the  red  line  depicts  horizontal  wellbore,  the  blue  line  and  the  randomly 
distributed line segments represent the hydraulic fracture and natural fractures respectively).  Constant production pressure is 
applied at the wellbore and no-flux conditions are applied at SRV boundaries.

In practice, the primary hydraulic fracture and secondary fracture networks within each SRV  unit, can be created statistically 
by using seismic, well and core data (Ahmed et al. 2013; Cornette et al. 2012 ) and by matching hydraulic fracture propagation 
models. Hydraulic fracture models that commonly used in industry relies on linear elastic fracture  mechanics (LEFM) (Johri 
and Zoback  2013; Weng  2014), but it is only valid for brittle rocks (Wang et al. 2016), recent studies demonstrate that using 
energy  based  cohesive  zone  model  can  resolve  the  issue  of  singularity  at  the  fracture  tip  and  these  cohesive  zone  based 
hydraulic  fracture  models  not only can be used in both brittle and ductile  formations, but also can capture complex fracture 
evolution, such as natural fracture interactions (Guo et al. 2015), fracture reorientation from different perforation angles (Wang 
2015),  producing  well  interference  (Wang  2016a),  the  effects  of  fracturing  spacing  and  sequencing  on  fracture 
interaction/coalescence  from  single  and  multiple  horizontal  wells  (Wang  2016b)  and  integrate  microseismic  data  with  non-
planar  fracture  modeling  (Haddad  et  al.  2016).  Combine  hydraulic  fracture  modeling  and  microseismic  data,  the  spatial 
distribution of fracture networks can be estimated or calibrated by various methods (Aimene and Ouenes, 2015; Huang et al. 
2014;  Johri  and  Zoback  2013;  Yu  et  al.  2014).  And  the  properties  of  the  propped  fracture  and  un-propped  fracture  can  be 
determined through conductivity test under various pressures and confining stresses (Fredd et al. 2000; Ghassemi and Suarez-
Rivera  2012),  so  that  the  parameters  define  transport  capacity  of  fractures  can  be  determined  (e.g.,  fitting  Eq.A.8  with 
laboratory data). With all these information, the spatial and intrinsic properties of DFNs can be estimated. How to map fracture 
networks across different fracturing stages based on microseismic data/hydraulic  fracture modeling and fully characterize the 
entire horizontal completion is beyond the  scope of this  article. Because  natural  fractures are formed  within  geological time 
scale and the formation itself may have gone through multiple tectonic  events, the distribution and orientation of the natural 
fractures  do  not  necessarily  relate  to  the  current  in-situ  stresses.  The  distribution  and  orientation  of  natural  fractures  are 
randomly placed inside SRV in this study. We first specify the density of DFNs (how many DFNs we need in our given SRV), 
then the center points of each DFN is arbitrarily generated in the SRV, and a random DFN orientation and DFN length (within 
predefine  range)  are  assigned  to  each  center  point  to  generate  two  end  points  of  DFN,  connect  these  two  points  and  all  the 
DFNs are created in the simulation domain. The final distribution of natural fractures is pictured in Fig. 4.  

Table  1  shows  all  the  input  parameters  used  for  the  base  case  simulation,  which  includes  reservoir  conditions,  drainage 
geometry, fracture conductivity, real gas properties, and gas adsorption parameters. All these input parameters are reasonably 
designed to reflect a typical shale reservoir formation, where around 60% of initial gas-in-place comes from adsorbed gas, this 
can be the case in many organic-rich shale formations (Darishchev et al., 2013). The impact adsorption gas on total material 
balance  and  gas  production  will  be  examined  later.  For  the  base  case  simulation,  the  evolutions  of  matrix  and  fracture 
permeability are disabled (matrix and fracture permeability maintain constant during production) and their effects on gas well 
performance will be investigated separately the following sections.

Fig. 5 shows the pressure distribution in the simulated SRV unit after 1 and 12 months of production. It can be observed that 
the pressure  transient behavior has reached the boundary after  one  month of production,  owing to the existence of abundant 
and  well-connected  conductive  fracture  networks,  and  pseudo-steady-state  flow  has  already  ensued  from  the  initial  transient 
flow,  to  dominate  the  rest  of  the  production  history.  After  12  months  of  production,  most  of  the  area  that  penetrated  by  the 
main hydraulic fracture has been well depleted due to the well-connected fracture system and effective linear flow from matrix 
to fracture, but the area in front the main hydraulic fracture tip still remain largely untapped.

Fig.  6  shows  the  gas  viscosity,  gas  density,  fraction  of  adsorption  gas  produced  and  mean  effective  stress  profiles  in  the 
simulated  SRV  after  1  month  of  production,  all  of  which  are  time-space  dependent  as  pore  pressure  declines.  It  can  be 
observed that gas viscosity and gas density are lower in the region that adjacent to the hydraulic fracture, where pore pressure 
is also lower. And the highest mean effects stress also concentrates around the low-pressure zone. The lower the pore pressure, 
the  higher  the  effective  stress.  It  can  be  further  noticed  that,  at  most,  around  53%  of  adsorption  gas  can  be  produced  in  the 
region that close to hydraulic fracture surface with current operation conditions (i.e., 5 MPa wellbore pressure) and adsorption 
gas  properties  (  determined  by  Langmuir  volume  and  pressure  constant).  This  implies  that  there  are  still  a  large  amount  of 
residual  adsorption  gas  cannot  be  ever  recovered  no  matter  how  long  it  takes,  unless  lower  bottom-hole  pressure  or  other 
stimulation methods are applied.

Fig.  7 shows pressure profile along the  hydraulic  fracture  after 1 and 12  months of production. The  hydraulic  fracture  half-
length is 80  meters (on the  horizontal  axis, 0 and 80 represent the  wellbore and fracture tip, respectively). It is obvious that 
pressure  drop  does  exist  along  the  fracture  length,  but  the  magnitude  of  pressure  loss  is  insignificant,  and  becomes  even 
smaller as time goes on. This is due to the fact that the matrix permeability is extremely small and turbulence flow is unlikely 

to  happen  under  such  low  level  of  flow  rate,  and  the  permeability  of  the  fracture  is  large  enough.  In  late  times,  when  the 
pressure drop is even smaller along the fracture path, the hydraulic fracture can be viewed as infinite conductivity.

Fig. 8 shows the cumulative production and average monthly production rate. It clearly demonstrates that the  production rate 
declines  dramatically  in  the  first  two  years,  and  becomes  more  stable  in  later  times.  Fig.  9  shows  the  monthly  production 
decline rate and normalized production rate (monthly production rate divided by production rate for the first month). It can be 
observed that the gas production rate declines at 20%-40% per month in the first a few months and the decline rate stabilizes 
around 5% per month after 20 months of production. It can be also noticed that the monthly production rate declines 90% at 
the end of the second year of production, which is a very typical scenario for unconventional reservoirs.

Impact of Adsorption Gas 

 

In  the  above  base  case  simulation,  around  60%  gas  initially  in  place  is  adsorption  gas.  In  the  section,  we  remove  all  the 
adsorbed gas and leave only free gas in the porous medium, to examine its impact on gas production and decline trend. Fig. 10 
shows the pressure distribution in the simulated SRV unit after 1 and 12 months of production. Compared with Fig. 5, where 
adsorption gas is included, the results indicate that pressure declines more rapidly and a larger area in the simulated SRV can 

be depleted with the same production time.  
 

Fig. 10 Pressure distribution in the SRV after 1 and 12 months of production, without adsorption gas 

 

 
Fig. 11 demonstrates that more gas can be produced when adsorption gas is included in the model, because there is much less 
total initial gas in place if only consider free gas alone. Fig.  12  indicates that the existence of adsorption gas indeed reduces 
production decline rate, especially in the early stages. This can be explained by the fact that the release of adsorption gas can 
compensate pressure loss in the SRV to some degree, so more gas can be produced at the same pressure level. However, in the 
later  stage,  the  impact  of  adsorption  gas  on  pressure  declines  becomes  less  obvious,  this  is  because  most  of  the  recoverable 
adsorption gas have been produced as the overall pressure declines in the SRV, and the remaining adsorption gas contribute 
much less portion of total gas produced, as the pressure declines further. It is contrary to the common belief that adsorption gas 
becomes  important  only  when  the  average  pressure  in  the  reservoir  drops  to  a  certain  level  during  the  state  of  pseudo-state 
flow.  In  fact,  adsorption  gas  has  more  impact  in  early  transient  flow  stages  when  the  desorbed  gas  continues  compensating 
pressure  loss  inside  the  matrix  that  is  depleting  by  the  adjacent  low-pressure  sinks  (i.e.,  well-connected  fracture  networks). 
Combine Fig.11 and Fig.12, we can conclude that adsorption gas has more impact on cumulative production (as governed by 
Eq.A.2 and A3, from a material balance perspective) than it has on long-term production decline trend.

modified to be 10 nd and 500  nd from the base case simulation (matrix permeability is  100 nd).  Fig.  13  shows the pressure 
profiles in the SRV after 1 month of production with different matrix permeability. It can be clearly noticed that when matri x 
permeability is only 10 nd, pressure depletion is constrained to the close vicinity of fracture networks that  well-connected the 
hydraulic  fracture.  However,  when  the  matrix  permeability  increases  to  500  nd,  the  hydraulic  fracture  becomes  the  main 
pressure sink source and the role of natural fractures become less significant. 
 

Fig. 13 Pressure distribution in the SRV after 1 month of production with different matrix permeability 

 

 
As mentioned in the previous section, the apparent permeability in the matrix of shale gas formations can be altered by non-
Darcy  flow,  gas  slippage,  the  release  of  adsorption  layer  and  rock  compaction  during  production.  A  unified  shale  matrix 
permeability  model  (Eq.A.27)  that  encompasses  all  these  mechanisms  is  implemented  in  the  simulator.  When  the  matrix 
permeability is allowed to evolve as pore pressure declines, the in-situ matrix permeability will be space and time dependent, 
as opposed to maintaining its initial matrix permeability.  Fig.  14 shows the values of Knudsen Number and matrix apparent 
permeability in the SRV after 1 month of production. The Knudsen number is a dimensionless parameter that can be used to 
differentiate Ô¨Çow regimes in conduits at micro and nanoscale, and Darcy‚Äôs law is only valid when Knudsen number is less than 
10‚àí3 (Knudsen 1909). The simulation results indicate that Knudsen Number increases as pore pressure declines, and the value 
of Knudsen Number reveals that slip and transition flow regimes are most likely to be encountered. It can be also observed that 
the matrix apparent permeability is the highest (around 227 nd) in the low-pressure zone region, while remaining the same as 
initial matrix permeability (100 nd) in the region that has not been tapped by pressure depletion. The local matrix permeability 
will evolve as pressure transient front edge continues to propagate: starting from areas that are close to pressure sink to the rest 
of the SRV.  
 

Fig. 14 Knudsen Number and matrix apparent permeability profiles in the SRV after 1 month of production, Km=100 nd 

 

Fig.  15  shows  the  cumulative  production  of  different  matrix  permeability.  The  results  demonstrate  that  more  gas  can  be 
produced  with  higher  matrix  permeability,  and  the  evolution  of  matrix  permeability  during  production  can  indeed  make  a 
difference in gas production, due to the enhanced local matrix apparent permeability. Fig. 16 shows the normalized production 
with different permeability. It indicates that, even though, higher matrix permeability contributes to higher production rate, it 
also increases production decline rate.

It  seems  the  impact  of  matrix  permeability  evolution  during  production  has  limited  impact  on  overall  gas  production.  It  is 
possible  that  with  abundant,  conductive  fracture  networks,  the  general  the  role  of  matrix  permeability  itself  is  diminished. 
Next, all the natural fractures are removed from the simulation domain and the hydraulic fracture serves as the only conductive 
path for gas flow. Fig. 17 and Fig. 18 show the cumulative production and normalized production rate with and without matrix 
permeability  evolution.  The  results  demonstrate  that  matrix  permeability  evolution  has  a  more  pronounced  impact  on 
cumulative production if fracture networks are not included, but it has a negligible impact on production decline trend.

Impact of Non-SRV 

As discussed earlier, sub-optimal completion design (stress interference) and reservoir heterogeneity (brittle and ductile rocks) 
can  lead  to  unevenly  stimulated  reservoir  volume  along  the  horizontal  wellbore.  In  order  to  investigate  the  impact  of  Non-
SRV,  where  the  pre-existing  natural  fractures  have  not  been  activated  by  the  stimulation  job,  the  simulation  domain  is 
extended beyond the SRV regime, as shown in Fig. 19.  All the input parameters and boundary conditions remain the same as 
the base case. 
 

Fig. 19  A plane view of multiple transverse fractures and simulation domain that contain Non-SRV 

 

 

Fig. 20 shows the pressure profiles in the simulated domain after 1 and 12 months of production. It can be observed that after 1 
month  of  production,  the  front  edge  of  transient  flow  regime  has  reached  the  boundary  of  SRV,  and  after  12  months  of 
production, most area within the SRV, that penetrated by the hydraulic fracture, has been well depleted. But the pressure in the 
Non-SRV regime still remains relatively high.

Fig.  21  shows the impact of Non-SRV on cumulative production with different matrix permeability. The results  indicate the 

matrix  permeability have a vital role in  determining the influence of Non-SRV. When  matrix permeability is high (e.g., 100 
nd),  less  time  is  needed  to  observe  the  effects  of  Non-SRV  and  much  more  gas  can  be  produced  from  Non-SRV.  On  the 
contrary, when matrix permeability is small (e.g., 10 nd), the effects of Non-SRV on gas production is restricted. The smaller 
the matrix permeability, the lesser impact that Non-SRV has on production. The results also demonstrate the existence of Non-
SRV amplifies the effects on matrix evolution. It should be mentioned that accumulative production assumed the same number 
of unit production pattern. If the length of a horizontal well is fixed, larger fracture spacing, with the inclusion of Non-SRV, 
shall have less production, due to less number of unit production pattern.

Fig.  22 shows the impact of Non-SRV on production decline with different matrix permeability. The results indicate that the 
gas  production  decline  rate  can  be  mitigated  if  Non-SRV  exists.  And  the  matrix  permeability  plays  a  different  role  in 
production decline trend, compared with the case where only SRV is considered: The higher the matrix permeability, the lower 
the  decline  rate,  because  pressure  loss  in  the  SRV  can  be  compensated  more  quickly  by  the  surrounding  Non-SRV.  This  is 
contradictory to the effect of matrix permeability on decline trend that is shown in Fig. 16, where only SRV is included.

Next, we investigate effects of the density of conductive natural fractures inside the SRV, by reducing the number of  natural 
fractures from previous simulation case. Fig. 23 shows the pressure profiles in the simulated domain after 1 and 12 months of 
production when the fracture network in the SRV is sparse.  Compared with Fig. 20, where the density of natural fractures is 
much higher, fewer reservoir volumes are depleted during the same production period.

Fig. 24 and Fig. 25 demonstrate the impact of fracture network density in the SRV on cumulative production and production 
decline trend. No surprising that dense fracture networks lead to higher production rate and higher cumulative production, but 
it also results in more rapid production decline rate.

Impact of Fracture Networks  

In this section, the role of natural fractures, their distribution and pressure/stress dependent conductivity on gas production and 
production  decline  trend  will  be  extensively  examined.  Fig.  26  shows  the  relationships  between  fluid  pressure  and  fracture 
permeability that will be implemented as pressure-dependent-permeability for fractures in the following simulation. As can be 
seen, when the fluid pressure declines from initial pore pressure (35 MPa) to bottom-hole pressure (5MPa), the permeability of 
hydraulic fracture reduced to 78% of its initial  value, while the permeability of natural fractures reduced to 10% of its  initial 
value.  Ideally,  laboratory  experiment  should  be  used  to  determine  the  propped  and  un-propped  fracture  conductivity  as  a 
function of effective stress (Fredd et al. 2000; Ghassemi  and Suarez-Rivera  2012), and in the reservoir, local effective stress 
increases  as  pore  pressure  decreases  during  depletion.  For  the  purpose  of  simplicity  and  easy  interpret  results,  the  local 
relationship between fracture conductivity and pore pressure is represented by the  relationship between fracture permeability 
and pore pressure, by assuming the fracture width remains the same. Because fracture conductivity is the product of fracture 
permeability  and  fracture  width,  shift  fracture  permeability  has  the  same  effect  as  shift  fracture  conductivity  on  simulation 
results. In addition, the fracture storage effects have negligible impact on gas production, because the driving forces of primary 
shale  gas  recovery  come  from  the  gas  volume  expansion  and  gas  desorption  with  declining  pressure.  The  conception  of 
pressure-dependent-permeability  for  fractures,  can  sometimes  be  referred  to  as  pressure-dependent-conductivity,  stress-
dependent-permeability  or  stress-dependent-conductivity  in  literature.  For  consistency,  the  term  ‚Äúpressure-dependent-
permeability (PDP)‚Äù, will be used throughout  this article, to represent the changes in  fracture conductivity as  local effective 
stress increases and fluid pressure declines.

Fig. 26 Pressure dependent fracture permeability 

 

 

Fig.  27 shows the cumulative production under different scenarios. In order to have a  more comprehensive comparison, the 
cases of a vertical well and no fracture networks are included. The ‚ÄúDense Fracture Networks‚Äù represents the fracture network 
topology  in  the  base  case  simulation  (as  shown  in  Fig.  5), while  the  ‚ÄúSparse  Fracture  Networks‚Äù  represent  much  less  dense 
fracture networks in the SRV (as shown in Fig. 23). The results indicate that the denser the fracture networks, the larger the 
fracture  surface  area,  the  higher  the  gas  production.  The  pressure  dependent  fracture  permeability  indeed  reduced  the 
production by impairing the efficiency of fracture conductivity on fluid transport. Fig. 28 shows the corresponding production 
decline  trend.  Combined  with  Fig.  27,  it  can  be  concluded  that  even  though,  dense  fracture  networks  with  large  fracture 
surface  area  lead  to  higher  absolute  production  rate  and  cumulative  production,  but  they  also  result  in  higher  production 
decline rate.

Next,  the  matrix  permeability  is  reduced  to  10  nd,  Fig.  29  and  Fig.  30  shows  the  impact  of  matrix  permeability  on  gas 
production and its decline trend in different scenarios. Compared with previous results, it can be observed that the existence of 
fracture networks has more impact on gas production when matrix permeability is lower (i.e., the cumulative production in the 
case of dense fracture networks is more than 2 times of that with sparse fracture networks when matrix permeability is 10 nd, 
while the cumulative production in the case of dense fracture networks is only around a quarter more than that sparse fracture 
networks  when  matrix  permeability  is  100  nd).  It  can be  also  noticed  that  regardless  of  matrix  permeability,  denser  fracture 
networks and larger fracture surface area inside SRV always lead to higher production and higher decline rate over time.

Previous study (Baihly et al. 2010) claims that the production decline trend in Barnett Shales is more gradual than other shale 
plays, mainly because  the natural fracture set in Barnett Shales are more abundant, better connected and the conductivity is 
less pressure dependent. However, our above analysis leads to opposite conclusions.  More adsorption gas and the inclusion of 
Non-SRV  can  reduce  the  production  decline  rate,  but  a  higher  density  of  natural  fracture  networks  with  better  conductivity 
always lead to steeper production decline trend. This can be explained by simple reasoning: with more natural fractures that 
connected  to  the  hydraulic  fracture,  more  gas  can  be  produced  initially  due  to  more  reservoir  contact  area.  But  as  the  shale 
matrix that  close to the  fracture surface depleted, it is  more difficult  to deplete the gas inside shale  matrix that at a distance 
away  from  the  fracture  surface,  so  the  relative  production  rate  declines  more  rapidly  with  larger  fracture  surface  area  with 
higher initial production rate. At the same time, higher production rate lead to sooner termination of transient flow inside SRV 
and the ensued steady-steady, boundary dominated flow makes the production rate declines further. 

It  is  intuitive  to  think  that  fracture  dependent  permeability/conductivity  reduce  overall  production  and  increase  production 
decline rate.  Baihly et al. (2010) also reported that the Haynesville and Eagle Ford Shales have steeper decline rates because 
of  the  degradation  of  fracture  network  conductivity  during  production.    However,  the  results  from  our  above  study  indicate 
that  pressure  dependent  fracture  permeability  does  impair  the  overall  production,  but  it  actually  reduces  production  decline 
rate,  regardless  of  matrix  permeability.  If  we  re-examine  Fig.  7,  it  can  be  noticed  that  the  pressure  drop  along  the  path  of 
fracture is small and if the all the conductive fractures are well connected initially, once a low-pressure sink is imposed at the 
wellbore or perforation tunnel, the pressure transient behavior can dissipate very quickly and the fluid pressure inside all the 
well-connected  fracture  networks  drops  to  the  level  of  wellbore  pressure.  This  means  the  reduction  of  fracture  conductivity 
(due  to  increased  effective  stress)  happens  once  production  starts,  instead  of  occurring  gradually  as  reservoir  pore  pressure 
declines.  Fig. 31 shows the impact of pressure dependent fracture permeability on gas production in the first month, it is clear 
that the reduction of fracture permeability reduces initial production rate. Even tough pressure dependent fracture permeability 

reduces  production  decline  rate,  it  also  reduces  absolute  production  rate  at  the  very  beginning,  and  that  it  why  it  harms  the 
overall cumulative production.

It  seems  that  effects  of  fracture  PDP  on  production  decline  trend  contradict  common  beliefs  at  this  point.  Next,  the  natural 
fractures in the SRV are re-organized, such that they are poorly connected and do not intercept by hydraulic fracture. Then the 
low-pressure  sink  along  the  hydraulic  fracture  will  not  impact  the  conductivity  of  natural  fractures  at  the  beginning  of 
production.  Fig.  32  shows  the  pressure  distribution  inside  SRV  after  1  and  12  months  of  production  with  poorly  connected 
natural fractures. Compared with Fig. 5, where the fracture networks are well connected, the role of hydraulic fracture is more 
dominant in the depletion process. 
 

Fig. 32 Pressure distribution in the SRV after 1 and 12 months of production with poorly connected fracture networks 

 

 

Fig. 33 and Fig. 34 show the impact of fracture connectivity and pressure dependent fracture permeability on gas production 
and production decline. The results pressure dependent fracture permeability does impact gas production and  its decline trend 
if the fracture networks are well connected, as analyzed above. However, if the fractures are sparsely distributed in the SRV 
and not hydraulic coroneted to each other, it has negligible influence on well performance, if it has any at all. That‚Äôs why the 
density of micro-seismic events generally do not correlate to production, because it does not reflect the connectivity of fracture 
networks and only these stimulated fractures that well connected to the main fracture can enhance the overall flow capacity in 
the SRV.

Fig. 34 Normalized production rate with different fracture connectivity 

 
Here,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  sharp  production  decline  trend  in  some  shale  plays  cannot  be  caused  purely  by  pressure 
dependent  fracture  permeability/conductivity.  However,  it  is  possible  that  rock  creep  or  visco-elasto-plastic  behaviors  can 
reduce  propped  or  un-propped  fracture  conductivity  over  time,  which  can  cause  steeper  decline  of  production  rate.  Even 
though there are abundant literature on the changes of fracture permeability/conductivity as a function of pressure or confining 
stress, the time-dependent reduction in fracture permeability/conductivity is still limited, hence, will not be discussed further in 
this article. 
 
Finally, the impact of initial reservoir pressure on the effects of  pressure-dependent permeability is investigated.  Fig.  35  and 
Fig. 36 show the impact of initial reservoir pressure. The results demonstrate that lower initial reservoir pressure leads to lower 
production and lower production decline rate. This is due to the fact that lower reservoir pressure result in less pressure drive 
for gas  flow (under the same  bottom-hole pressure) and less initial gas in place (less gas exists in the  form of adsorption or 
compressed  in  pore  space).  In  addition,  the  comparative  reduction  in  fracture  permeability  is  less  when  initial  reservoir 
pressure  is  low  (i.e.,  percentage  of  reduction  in  fracture  permeability  is  lower  if  pressure  declines  from  20  MPa  to  5  M 
Pa, instead of dropping from 35 MPa to 5 MPa, as reflected in Fig.26).

Field Data Interpretation 

Valk√≥ and Lee (2010) compiled monthly incremental production from selected Barnett Shale well groups, as shown in Fig. 37. 
The beginning of production from each  well group starts from July of 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. From the graph, it 
can be observed that  wells that  are completed later, have  higher  initial production rate, but the  production rate also declines 
faster. This can be explained by the fact that the improvement in technology and field operations makes well stimulation more 
efficient over time. With  more hydraulic fracturing stages  and better hydraulic fracture design, denser fracture networks and 
larger  fracture  surface  area  can  be  created,  thus  both  initial  production  and  production  decline  rate  increase,  which  concurs 
well with above modeling results and analysis. Even though better stimulation design and larger effective fracture surface area 
lead to steeper production decline trend, they do enhance long-term recovery because of much higher production rate for both 
initial and later production stages.

Conclusions and Discussions 
Predict  post-fracture  production  rate  and  its  decline  trend  in  shale  reservoirs  with  enough  certainty  is  crucial  for  ultimate 
recovery  estimation  and  economic  decisions.  Decline  curve  analysis  is  commonly  used  to  determine  EUR  and  in-place 
reserves are based on conventional reservoir performance assumptions. In unconventional reservoirs, these assumptions may 
not be valid, or they may be valid only so late in the reservoir life as to be little useful. Depending on the size of SRV, matrix 
permeability and the density, connectivity, conductivity of fracture networks, boundary dominated flow may not be apparent in 
the  first  a  few  years,  making  traditional  decline  curve  analysis  ineffective.  In  addition,  empirical  models  for  decline  curve 
analysis cannot be used to analyze what factors influence the production  and decline trend, which makes it difficult to guide 
completion designs or optimize field development. 

In this article, we first presented some possible mechanisms that may impact shale gas production and its decline trend. Then, 
a proposed unified shale gas reservoir model, which is capable of modeling real gas transport and nano-flow mechanisms in 
fractured  shale  systems,  is  used  to  investigate  what  factors  influence  gas  production  and  decline  trend  under  coupled, 
multiphysics effects. The results of this study provide us a comprehensive understanding of the correlations between  various 
factors and production in fractured shale gas wells. More in-depth knowledge regarding the effects of factors controlling the 
behavior of gas  flow in  stimulated  wells can  help  us develop more reliable  models to  forecast shale  gas production, decline 
trend and ultimate recovery. Conclusions reached from the analysis presented in this paper include 

 

1.  The  existence  of  adsorption  gas  increases  overall  production  and  decreases  the  production  decline  rate.  However,  
contrary to the common belief that adsorption gas becomes important only when the average pressure in the reservoir 
drops  to  a  certain  level  during  boundary  dominated  flow,  the  adsorption  gas  plays  a  more  important  role  in  early 
transient flow stages when the desorbed gas continues compensating pressure loss. And in the late time of pseudo-state 
flow, the further release of residual adsorption gas has much less influence on gas production. 

2.  Even  though  higher  matrix  permeability  contributes  to  higher  production  rate,  it  also  leads  to  steeper  production 
decline trend in bounded SRV. And matrix permeability becomes less influential on gas production in the presence of 
abundant, conductive fracture networks.  

3.  The evolution of shale matrix apparent permeability during production can increase overall production, but has limited 
impact  on  production  decline  trend.  If  dense,  well-connected  fracture  networks  dominate  the  overall  reservoir  flow 
capacity, then the changes in matrix apparent permeability in nano-pores have a negligible impact on production and 
decline trend. 

4.  When SRV is surrounded by Non-SRV, production rate declines more gradually. The higher the matrix permeability, 
the  lower  the  decline  rate,  because  pressure  loss  in  the  SRV  can  be  compensated  more  quickly  by  the  surrounding 
Non-SRV 

5.  The  density,  conductivity  and  connectivity  of  fracture  networks  have  dominant  impacts  on  gas  production  and  its 
decline trend, especially when matrix permeability is low. Fracture networks with dense, highly conductive and well-
connected fractures, always lead to higher production rate and more rapid production decline.  

6. 

It is a common misconception to think that the pressure (stress) dependent fracture permeability /conductivity reduce 
overall  production  and  increase  production  decline  rate.  However,  this  study  reveals  that  the  pressure  dependent 
fracture permeability does impair the overall production, but it actually reduce production decline rate, regardless of 
matrix permeability. This is due to the  fact that the reduction of fracture conductivity  happens  soon after  production 
start, instead of occurring gradually as reservoir pore pressure declines. 

7. 

If  the  fractures  are  sparsely  distributed  in  the  SRV  and  not  hydraulically  well  connected,  then  these  fractures  have 
negligible influence on well performance, if it has any at all. So does their conductivity evolutions. 

8.  The reason for much higher production decline rate in unconventional reservoirs than that in conventional reservoirs is 
due  to  the  fact  that  more  reservoir  contact  area  that  contributes  to  production  in  unconventional  reservoirs.  If  gas  is 
produced  from  a  single  vertical  well,  then  the  production  decline  trend  is  stable  and  gradual,  regardless  whether  the 
reservoir  itself  is  unconventional  or  not.  So  to  maintain  the  overall  production  output  in  unconventional  reservoir 
fields, new wells have to be drilled and completed at a much faster pace to compensate high production decline rate. 

In  general,  more  adsorption  gas  and  the  existence  of  Non-SRV  can  reduce  the  production  decline  rate,  and  denser,  more 
conductive, better-connected fracture networks, with larger effective fracture surface areas in the SRV, always lead to higher 
production  rate  and  steeper  production  decline  trend.  Once  the  drawdown  begins,  the  increase  of  effective  stress  around 
conductive  fractures  result  in  degradation  of  fracture  (propped  and  un-propped)  conductivity,  which  decreases  initial 
production  rate,  but  also  reduces  production  decline  rate.  So  the  reason  for  the  cases  of  steep  production  decline  in  some 
ductile  formations,  such  as  Haynesville  and  Eagle  Ford  Shale,  cannot  be  explained  by  lower  matrix  permeability,  less 
abundant natural fractures or pressure (stress) dependent fracture permeability/conductivity. The possible mechanism of rapid 
production  decline  trend  in  ductile  shale  plays  may  result  from  rock  creep  and  visco-elasto-plastic  behaviors  that  reduce 
fracture  conductivity  over  time  (e.g.,  gradual  embedment  of  proppant),  instead  of  response  to  the  increase  of  effects  stress 

promptly. Quantitative characterization of the visco-elasto-plastic and ductility of tight shale reservoirs using indicators, such 
as rock mechanic properties, clay content/ maturation and organic content, is important to evaluate long-term production. Even 
though  numerous  literature  have  discussed  the  pressure  (stress)  dependent  fracture  permeability/conductivity,  our 
understanding of the coupled physical process in  time-dependent rock deformation and its effects on fracture conductivity is 
still limited, and more research efforts in this area are certainly needed.

Appendix 
Formulations of Real Gas Transport and Nano-Flow Mechanisms in Fractured Shales 
In  this  section,  the  mathematical  formulas  that  implemented  in  our  unified  shale  gas  reservoir  simulator  for  modeling  and 
simulating  gas  production  in  fractured  shale  systems  are  presented  and  discussed.  The  fully  coupled  process  in  shale  gas 
reservoirs  involves  fluid  flow  within  the  formation  matrix  and  fractures,  shale  gas  adsorption  and  desorption,  real  gas 
properties  and  in-situ  stress  that  affected  by  local  pressure.  The  mathematical  framework  for  developing  shale  gas  reservoir 
models presented here enables us to investigate the interactions among multi-physics phenomena in shale gas formations and 
examine their implications  for flow in  nano-porous medium, global  well performance, production decline trend and  ultimate 
recovery.  All  the  equations  presented  in  this  section  do  not  have  any  unit  conversion  parameters,  any  unit  system  can  be 
applied (e.g., SI unit or Oil Field unit) as long as they are consistent.

fracture width and ‚àáTP is the pressure gradient tangent to the fracture surface. The expected reduction in fracture permeability 
caused by  the  increasing effective  stress during production is can be described by power law relationship (Cho et al.  2013),

where ùëòùëì is the fracture permeability, ùëòùëì,ùëñ is the fracture permeability at initial reservoir conditions, B is a fracture compaction 
parameter that can be determined from  experimental data, and ùúéùëö is the mean effective stress, which is the mean total stress 
minus pore pressure. In our presented cases, the relationship between fracture permeability and local pore pressure is reflected 
in Fig.26. It assumes the fact that the conductivity of natural fracture is much smaller than that of hydraulic fracture and it is 
more sensitive to pressure/stress changes.

Real Gas Properties and Rock-Fluid Coupling

                                                                                              (A. 11) 

 
T is the reservoir temperature, M is the gas average molecular weight and R is the universal gas constant. The Z-factor can be 
estimated by solving Equation of State (EOS) or using correlations for the gas mixtures. In this study, the Z-factor is calculated 
using an explicit correlation (Mahmoud, 2013) based on the pseudo-reduced pressure (ppr) and pseudo-reduced temperature 
(Tpr): 
 

ùëç = (0.702ùëí‚àí2.5ùëáùëùùëü)(ùëùùëùùëü

The  advantage  of  using  explicit  correlation  is  to  avoid  solving  higher  order  equations  respect  to  Z-factor,  which  leads  to 
multiple solutions and increases computation efforts. 
 
Gas  viscosity  is  an  intrinsic  property  of  gas  itself,  which  can  be  determined  based  on  its  compositions,  pressure  and 
temperature. Lee et al. Correlation (1966) is used to estimate the gas viscosity:

The porous medium is assumed to be perfectly elastic so that no plastic deformation occurs. The constitutive equation can be 
expressed in terms of effective stress ( ùúéùëñùëó, ), strain ( ùúÄùëñùëó ), and pore pressure (P):

Shale Gas Apparent Permeability Correction 

Darcy‚Äôs  law  cannot  describe  the  actual  gas  behavior  and  transport  phenomena  in  nano-porous  media.  In  such  nano-pore 
structure, fluid flow departs from the well-understood continuum regime, in favor of other mechanisms such as slip, transition, 
and  free  molecular  conditions.  The  Knudsen  number  (Knudsen,  1909)  is  a  dimensionless  parameter  that  can  be  used  to 
differentiate Ô¨Çow regimes in conduits at micro and nanoscale, for conduit with radius r, it can be estimated by

The apparent permeability of shale matrix can be represented by the following general form: 
 

ùëòùëé = ùëò‚àû ùëì(ùêæùëõ)                                                                                                  (A. 19) 

 
where ùëò‚àû is the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium, which is defined as the permeability for  a viscous, non-reacting 
ideal liquid, and it is determined by the nano-pore structure of porous medium itself. ùëì(ùêæùëõ) is the correlation term that relates 
the matrix apparent permeability and intrinsic permeability. Sakhaee-Pour and Bryant (2012) developed correlations which are 
based  lab  experiments.  They  proposed  a  first-order  permeability  model  in  the  slip  regime  and  a  polynomial  form  for  the 
permeability enhancement in the transition regime using regression method: 
 

ùëì(ùêæùëõ) = {

   1 + ùõº1ùêæùëõ                                                       Slip Regime

2         Transition Regime  0.1  <   ùêæùëõ   <  0.8

           (A. 20) 

 

where ùõº1 is  permeability  enhancement  coefficient  in  slip  regime.  To  ensure  the  approximation  of  continuity  of ùëì(ùêæùëõ) at  the 
boundary region of slip and transition regime, where no existing model available, ùõº1 is set to be 4.  Intuitively, Eqs. (A.18) and 
(A.20) predict net increases of ùêæùëõ and ùëì(ùêæùëõ) with decreasing pore pressure, respectively. However, decreasing pore pressure 
can also lead to reduction in pore radii and, in turn, reduce the intrinsic permeability ùëò‚àû. It can be seen from Eq. (A.19) that 

the  evolution  of  matrix  apparent  permeability ùëòùëé is  determined  by  two  combined  mechanisms  (i.e.,  the  variations  in ùëò‚àû and 
ùëì(ùêæùëõ) during production).  
 
Even  though  numerous  studies  (Lunati  and  Lee  2014;  Sigal  and  Qin  2008;  Shabro  et  al.  2012)  have  developed  various 
theoretical  models  to  account  for  the  effects  of  gas  diffusion  in  kerogen  in  permeability  enhancement,  but  how  to  quantify 
these effects in complex, heterogeneous shale systems are still not well understood within scientific and industry community. 
In  addition,  all  these  proposed  models  do  not  account  for  the  dynamic  changes  of  stress  and  adsorption  layer  as  pressure 
declines (as reflected in Fig.3) in a fractured system, which can significantly overestimate the effects of molecule diffusion on 
gas  production.  Recent  study  (Wang  et  al  2015b)  also  reveals  that  under  most  real  shale-gas-reservoir  conditions,  gas 
adsorption and the non-Darcy flow are dominant mechanisms in affecting apparent permeability, while the effects of surface 
diffusion caused by adsorbed gas can be largely overlooked. So in this article, molecule diffusion will not be discussed in the 
following derivations for matrix apparent permeability. 
 
Wang and Marongiu-Porcu (2015) conducted a comprehensive literature review on gas flow behavior in shale nano-pore space 
and proposed a unified matrix apparent permeability model, which bridges the effects of geomechanics, non-Darcy flow and 
gas  adsorption  layer  into  a  single  mode,  by  considering  the  microstructure  changes  in  nano-pore  space.  In  a  general  porous 
media, the loss in cross-section area is equivalent to the loss of porosity,

where variables with a subscript 0 correspond to their value at the reference state, which can be laboratory or initial reservoir 
conditions. Laboratory measurements by Dong  et al. (2010) show that the relationship between porosity and stress follows a 
power  law  relationship,  and  can  be  expressed  using  the  concept  of  mean  effective  stress ùúéùëö (Wang  and  Marongiu-Porcu 
2015):

ùê∂‚àÖ is a dimensionless material-specific constant that can be determined by lab experiments. For silty-shale samples, the values 
of ùê∂‚àÖ range from 0.014 to 0.056 (Dong et al., 2010). Combining Eq. (A. 21) and Eq. (A. 22) leads to the relationship between 
pore radius and local stress

When the adsorption layer is considered, the thickness of the gas adsorption layer, Œ¥ , can be interpolated based on a Langmuir 
type functional relationship:

where ùëëùëö is the average diameter of gas molecules residing on the pore surface. And the effective pore radius (A. 23) can be 
modified as: 
 

r = ùëü0 (

where ùõΩ is the coefficient that define the sensitivity of permeability to the changes of pore radius. Different shale formations 
may have different nano-pore structure typology, which leads to different values of ùõΩ. In this study,  ùõΩ equals 2 by assuming 
the overall all intrinsic permeability resembles fluid flow in a capillary tube (Beskok and Karniadakis 1999).  Combining Eq. 
(A. 25), Eq. (A. 26) and Eq. (A. 19), we have the final expression of matrix apparent permeability:

Compared  with  the  apparent  matrix  permeability  model  proposed  by  Wang  and  Marongiu-Porcu  (2015),  Eq.  (A.27)  is  a 
general formula for shale matrix apparent permeability, with additional parameter ùõÉ to relate the changes in pore radius to the 
alterations in intrinsic permeability.  
Based on the formulations introduced above, a unified shale gas reservoir simulator was constructed, with embedded discrete 
fracture networks and unstructured meshes. Newton-Raphson method (Ypma, 1995) and finite element analysis (Zienkiewicz 
and  Taylor,  2005)  are  used  to  solve  all  the  coupled  equations  numerically.  The  overall  flow  capacity  inside  the  stimulated 
reservoir volume is controlled by both matrix apparent permeability and the properties (density, connectivity and conductivity) 
of discrete fracture network.
