    <title>Modelling Geomechanical Impact of CO2 Injection Using Precomputed
  Response Functions</title>
    <summary>  When injecting CO2 or other fluids into a geological formation, pressure
plays an important role both as a driver of flow and as a risk factor for
mechanical integrity.
  The full effect of geomechanics on aquifer flow can only be captured using a
coupled flow-geomechanics model. In order to solve this computationally
expensive system, various strategies have been put forwards over the years,
with some of the best current methods based on sequential splitting.
  In the present work, we seek to approximate the full geomechanical effect on
flow without the need of coupling with a geomechanics solver during simulation,
and at a computational cost comparable to that of an uncoupled model. We do
this by means of precomputed pressure response functions. At grid model
generation time, a geomechanics solver is used to compute the mechanical
response of the aquifer for a set of pressure fields. The relevant information
from these responses is then stored in a compact form and embedded with the
grid model.
  We test the accuracy and computational performance of our approach on a
simple 2D and a more complex 3D model, and compare the results with those
produced by a fully coupled approach as well as from a simple decoupled method
based on Geertsma's uniaxial expansion coefficient.

    <title>Testing a coupled hydro-thermo-chemo-geomechanical model for gas hydrate
  bearing sediments using triaxial compression lab experiments</title>
    <summary>  Natural gas hydrates are considered a potential resource for gas production
on industrial scales. Gas hydrates contribute to the strength and stiffness of
the hydrate-bearing sediments. During gas production, the geomechanical
stability of the sediment is compromised. Due to the potential geotechnical
risks and process management issues, the mechanical behavior of the gas
hydrate-bearing sediments needs to be carefully considered. In this study, we
describe a coupling concept that simplifies the mathematical description of the
complex interactions occuring during gas production by isolating the effects of
sediment deformation and hydrate phase changes. Central to this coupling
concept is the assumption that the soil grains form the load-bearing solid
skeleton, while the gas hydrate enhances the mechanical properties of this
skeleton. We focus on testing this coupling concept in capturing the overall
impact of geomechanics on gas production behavior though numerical simulation
of a high-pressure isotropic compression experiment combined with methane
hydrate formation and dissociation. We consider a linear-elastic stress-strain
relationship because it is uniquely defined and easy to calibrate. Since, in
reality, the geomechanical response of the hydrate bearing sediment is
typically inelastic and is characterized by a significant shear-volumetric
coupling, we control the experiment very carefully in order to keep the sample
deformations small and well within the assumptions of poro-elasticity. The
closely co-ordinated experimental and numerical procedures enable us to
validate the proposed simplified geomechanics-to-flow coupling, and set an
important precursor towards enhancing our coupled hydro-geomechanical hydrate
reservoir simulator with more suitable elasto-plastic constitutive models.

    <title>Direct observation of coupled geochemical and geomechanical impacts on
  chalk microstructural evolution under elevated CO2 pressure. Part I</title>
    <summary>  The dissolution of porous media in a geologic formation induced by the
injection of massive amounts of CO2 can undermine the mechanical stability of
the formation structure before carbon mineralization takes place. The
geomechanical impact of geologic carbon storage is therefore closely related to
the structural sustainability of the chosen reservoir as well as the
probability of buoyancy driven CO2 leakage through caprocks. Here we show, with
a combination of ex situ nanotomography and in situ microtomography, that the
presence of dissolved CO2 in water produces a homogeneous dissolution pattern
in natural chalk microstructure. This pattern stems from a greater apparent
solubility of chalk and therefore a greater reactive subvolume in a sample.
When a porous medium dissolves homogeneously in an imposed flow field, three
geomechanical effects were observed: material compaction, fracturing and grain
relocation. These phenomena demonstrated distinct feedbacks to the migration of
the dissolution front and severely complicated the infiltration instability
problem. We conclude that the presence of dissolved CO2 makes the dissolution
front less susceptible to spatial and temporal perturbations in the strongly
coupled geochemical and geomechanical processes.

    <title>Pore-scale modeling of fluid-particles interaction and emerging
  poromechanical effects</title>
    <summary>  A micro-hydromechanical model for granular materials is presented. It
combines the discrete element method (DEM) for the modeling of the solid phase
and a pore-scale finite volume (PFV) formulation for the flow of an
incompressible pore fluid. The coupling equations are derived and contrasted
against the equations of conventional poroelasticity. An analogy is found
between the DEM-PFV coupling and Biot's theory in the limit case of
incompressible phases. The simulation of an oedometer test validates the
coupling scheme and demonstrates the ability of the model to capture strong
poromechanical effects. A detailed analysis of microscale strain and stress
confirms the analogy with poroelasticity. An immersed deposition problem is
finally simulated and shows the potential of the method to handle phase
transitions.

    <title>Multi-rate time stepping schemes for hydro-geomechanical model for
  subsurface methane hydrate reservoirs</title>
    <summary>  We present an extrapolation-based semi-implicit multirate time stepping (MRT)
scheme and a compound-fast MRT scheme for a naturally partitioned,
multi-time-scale hydro-geomechanical hydrate reservoir model. We evaluate the
performance of the two MRT methods compared to an iteratively coupled solution
scheme and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The performance of the
two MRT methods is evaluated in terms of speed-up and accuracy by comparison to
an iteratively coupled solution scheme. We observe that the extrapolation-based
semi-implicit method gives a higher speed-up but is strongly dependent on the
relative time scales of the latent (slow) and active (fast) components. On the
other hand, the compound-fast method is more robust and less sensitive to the
relative time scales, but gives lower speed up as compared to the semi-implicit
method, especially when the relative time scales of the active and latent
components are comparable.

    <title>Virtual Element Method for geomechanics on reservoir grids</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we study the use of Virtual Element method for geomechanics.
Our emphasis is on applications to reservoir simulations. The physical
processes that form the reservoirs, such as sedimentation, erosion and
faulting, lead to complex geometrical structures. A minimal representation,
with respect to the physical parameters of the system, then naturally leads to
general polyhedral grids. Numerical methods which can directly handle this
representation will be highly favorable, in particular in the setting of
advanced work-flows. The Virtual Element method is a promising candidate to
solve the linear elasticity equations on such models. In this paper, we
investigate some of the limits of the VEM method when used on reservoir models.
First, we demonstrate that care must be taken to make the method robust for
highly elongated cells, which is common in these applications, and show the
importance of calculating forces in terms of traction on the boundary of the
elements for elongated distorted cells. Second, we study the effect of
triangulations on the surfaces of curved faces, which also naturally occur in
subsurface models. We also demonstrate how a more stable regularization term
for reservoir application can be derived.

    <title>Iterative coupling of flow, geomechanics and adaptive phase-field
  fracture including level-set crack width approaches</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we present numerical studies of fixed-stress iterative coupling
for solving flow and geomechanics with propagating fractures in a porous
medium. Specifically, fracture propagations are described by employing a
phase-field approach. The extension to fixed-stress splitting to propagating
phase-field fractures and systematic investigation of its properties are
important enhancements to existing studies. Moreover, we provide an accurate
computation of the fracture opening using level-set approaches and a subsequent
finite element interpolation of the width. The latter enters as fracture
permeability into the pressure diffraction problem which is crucial for fluid
filled fractures. Our developments are substantiated with several numerical
tests that include comparisons of computational cost for iterative coupling and
nonlinear and linear iterations as well as convergence studies in space and
time.

    <title>A laboratory investigation of thermally induced pore pressures in the
  Callovo-Oxfordian Claystone</title>
    <summary>  In the framework of research into radioactive waste disposal, it was decided
to investigate the thermally induce pore pressure occurring in the
Callovo-Oxfordian claystone, a possible host rock in which the ANDRA
underground laboratory of Bure (East of France) has been excavated. Thermal
pore pressures appear in low permeability soils and rocks because the thermal
expansion coefficient of water is significantly higher than that of the solid
grains (Campanella and Mitchell; 1968 [1], Ghabezloo and Sulem; 2009 [2]). This
phenomenon has clearly been observed in various in-situ heating tests conducted
in Opalinus claystone in the Mont-Terri Underground Research Laboratory (URL)
in Switzerland (HE-D test) and in Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) claystone in the Bure
URL in France (TER test, Wileveau and Su; 2007 [3]) The processes of coring,
transportation, storage and specimen trimming induce some desaturation in the
sample. Due to the very low permeability (10-20 m2) of the COx claystone, a
long period of time is necessary to properly resaturate the sample, a mandatory
condition to satisfactorily investigate thermal pressurisation. Particular
emphasis was hence put on the previous saturation procedure that was carried
out under in-situ effective stress condition. Thermal pressurization has been
investigated by performing undrained heating tests while measuring pore
pressures changes in a specially adapted thermal isotropic compression cell.
Special care was devoted to calibration procedures to account for the effects
of the system on the pore pressure measurements. The thermal pressurization
coefficient measured appeared to change with temperature, mainly because of the
changes with temperature of both the water thermal expansion coefficient of
water and the drained compression coefficient of the claystone.

    <title>Numerical Simulation of Gas Storage Caverns in Qom Region</title>
    <summary>  The rock mechanical design of gas storage cavern in salt requires the
analysis of the stability and the usability of the cavern over the planned
operating time period. The design includes the build up of a rock mass model
and a numerical model taking into account the geological situation, load
condition, geometrical condition, and material parameters. In this paper
multiple caverns in salt formation with geological and geomechanical situation
in Qom (central part of Iran) was investigated a using creep model. Minimum
safe center to center distances (CTCD) of multiple horizontal caverns also were
studied. CTCD of caverns interact at less than two times of cavern diameter.
With increasing the CTCD to 2.5 times cavern diameters, diminish most
interaction.

    <title>Total-variation minimization with bound constraints</title>
    <summary>  We present a powerful and easy-to-implement algorithm for solving constrained
optimization problems that involve $L_1$/total-variation regularization terms,
and both equality and inequality constraints. We discuss the relationship of
our method to earlier works of Goldstein and Osher (2009) and Chartrand and
Wohlberg (2010), and demonstrate that our approach is a combination of the
augmented Lagrangian method with splitting and model projection. We test the
method on a geomechanical problem and invert highly compartmentalized pressure
change from noisy surface uplift observations. We conclude the paper with a
discussion of possible extension to a wide class of regularized optimization
problems with bound and equality constraints.

    <title>Robust joint full-waveform inversion of time-lapse seismic data sets
  with total-variation regularization</title>
    <summary>  We present a technique for reconstructing subsurface velocity model changes
from time-lapse seismic survey data using full-waveform inversion (FWI). The
technique is based on simultaneously inverting multiple survey vintages, with
model difference regularization using the total variation (TV) seminorm. We
compare the new TV-regularized time-lapse FWI with the $L_2$-regularized joint
inversion proposed in our earlier work, using synthetic data sets that exhibit
survey repeatability issues. The results demonstrate clear advantages of the
proposed TV-regularized joint inversion over alternatives methods for
recovering production-induced model changes that are due to both fluid
substitution and geomechanical effects.

    <title>A Numerical Study of Thermal-Hydraulic-Mechanical (THM) Simulation with
  the Application of Thermal Recovery in Fractured Shale Gas Reservoirs</title>
    <summary>  We presented a general multi-physics model for shale gas flow in fractured
systems, first the first time, with fully coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical
(THM) properties. The impact of gas adsorption, real gas properties, gas flow
in nano-scale pore space and geomechanics effects on total gas flow capacity
are investigated. We also showed that by elevating shale rock temperature, the
characteristic of gas adsorption behavior can be substantially altered.

    <title>A parallel-in-time fixed-stress splitting method for Biot's
  consolidation model</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we study the parallel-in-time iterative solution of coupled
flow and geomechanics in porous media, modelled by a two-field formulation of
the Biot's equations. In particular, we propose a new version of the fixed
stress splitting method, which has been widely used as solution method of these
problems. This new approach forgets about the sequential nature of the temporal
variable and considers the time direction as a further direction for
parallelization. We present a rigorous convergence analysis of the method and a
numerical experiment to demonstrate the robust behaviour of the algorithm.

    <title>GeoMFree3D: An Under-Development Meshfree Software Package for
  Geomechanics</title>
    <summary>  This paper briefly reports the GeoMFree3D, a meshfree / meshless software
package designed for analyzing the problems of large deformations and crack
propagations of rock and soil masses in geotechnics. The GeoMFree3D is
developed based on the meshfree RPIM, and accelerated by exploiting the
parallel computing on multi-core CPU and many-core GPU. The GeoMFree3D is
currently being under intensive developments. To demonstrate the correctness
and effectiveness of the GeoMFree3D, several simple verification examples are
presented in this paper. Moreover, future work on the development of the
GeoMFree3D is introduced.

    <title>Non-Isothermal, Multi-phase, Multi-component Flows through Deformable
  Methane Hydrate Reservoirs</title>
    <summary>  We present a hydro-geomechanical model for subsurface methane hydrate
systems. Our model considers kinetic hydrate phase change and non-isothermal,
multi-phase, multi-component flow in elastically deforming soils. The model
accounts for the effects of hydrate phase change and pore pressure changes on
the mechanical properties of the soil, and also for the effect of soil
deformation on the fluid-solid interaction properties relevant to reaction and
transport processes (e.g., permeability, capillary pressure, reaction surface
area). We discuss a 'cause-effect' based decoupling strategy for the model and
present our numerical discretization and solution scheme. We then identify the
important model components and couplings which are most vital for a
hydro-geomechanical hydrate simulator, namely, 1) dissociation kinetics, 2)
hydrate phase change coupled with non-isothermal two phase two component flow,
3) two phase flow coupled with linear elasticity (poroelasticity coupling), and
finally 4) hydrate phase change coupled with poroelasticity
(kinetics-poroelasticity coupling) and present numerical examples where, for
each example, one of the aforementioned model components/couplings is isolated.
A special emphasis is laid on the kinetics-poroelasticity coupling. We also
present a more complex 3D example based on a subsurface hydrate reservoir which
is destabilized through depressurization using a low pressure gas well. In this
example, we simulate the melting of hydrate, methane gas generation, and the
resulting ground subsidence and stress build-up in the vicinity of the well.

    <title>Modeling 1-D elastic P-waves in a fractured rock with hyperbolic jump
  conditions</title>
    <summary>  The propagation of elastic waves in a fractured rock is investigated, both
theoretically and numerically. Outside the fractures, the propagation of
compressional waves is described in the simple framework of one-dimensional
linear elastodynamics. The focus here is on the interactions between the waves
and fractures: for this purpose, the mechanical behavior of the fractures is
modeled using nonlinear jump conditions deduced from the Bandis-Barton model
classicaly used in geomechanics. Well-posedness of the initial-boundary value
problem thus obtained is proved. Numerical modeling is performed by coupling a
time-domain finite-difference scheme with an interface method accounting for
the jump conditions. The numerical experiments show the effects of contact
nonlinearities. The harmonics generated may provide a non-destructive means of
evaluating the mechanical properties of fractures.

    <title>Small World Property of a Rock Joint(Complexity of Frictional
  Interfaces: A Complex Network Perspective)</title>
    <summary>  The shear strength and stick-slip behavior of a rough rock joint are analyzed
using the complex network approach. We develop a network approach on
correlation patterns of void spaces of an evolvable rough fracture (crack type
II). Correlation among networks properties with the hydro -mechanical
attributes (obtained from experimental tests) of fracture before and after slip
is the direct result of the revealed non-contacts networks. Joint distribution
of locally and globally filtered correlation gives a close relation to the
contact zones attachment-detachment sequences through the evolution of shear
strength of the rock joint. Especially spread of node's degree rate to spread
of clustering coefficient rate yielded possible stick and slip sequences during
the displacements. Our method can be developed to investigate the complexity of
stick-slip behavior of faults as well as energy /stress localization on
crumpled shells/sheets in which ridge networks are controlling the energy
distribution.

    <title>Interaction between Injection Points during Hydraulic Fracturing</title>
    <summary>  We present a model of the hydraulic fracturing of heterogeneous poroelastic
media. The formalism is an effective continuum model that captures the coupled
dynamics of the fluid pressure and the fractured rock matrix and models both
the tensile and shear failure of the rock. As an application of the formalism,
we study the geomechanical stress interaction between two injection points
during hydraulic fracturing (hydrofracking) and how this interaction influences
the fracturing process. For injection points that are separated by less than a
critical correlation length, we find that the fracturing process around each
point is strongly correlated with the position of the neighboring point. The
magnitude of the correlation length depends on the degree of heterogeneity of
the rock and is on the order of 30-45 m for rocks with low permeabilities. In
the strongly correlated regime, we predict a novel effective fracture-force
that attracts the fractures toward the neighboring injection point.

    <title>Thermo-Poro-Mechanical Properties of Clayey Gouge and Application to
  Rapid Fault Shearing</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, the mechanism of fault pressurization in rapid slip events is
analyzed on the basis of a complete characterization of the
thermo-poro-mechanical behavior of a clayey gouge extracted at 760m depth in
Aigion fault in the active seismic zone of the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. It is
shown that the thermally collapsible character of this clayey gouge can be
responsible for a dramatic reduction of effective stress and a full
fluidization of the material. The thickness of the 'ultra localized' zone of
highly strained material is a key parameter that controls the competing
phenomena of pore pressure increase leading to fluidization of the fault gouge
and temperature increase leading to pore fluid vaporization.

    <title>Lattice-Boltzmann Method for Geophysical Plastic Flows</title>
    <summary>  We explore possible applications of the Lattice-Boltzmann Method for the
simulation of geophysical flows. This fluid solver, while successful in other
fields, is still rarely used for geotechnical applications. We show how the
standard method can be modified to represent free-surface realization of
mudflows, debris flows, and in general any plastic flow, through the
implementation of a Bingham constitutive model. The chapter is completed by an
example of a full-scale simulation of a plastic fluid flowing down an inclined
channel and depositing on a flat surface. An application is given, where the
fluid interacts with a vertical obstacle in the channel.

    <title>Isogeometric Boundary Element Analysis with elasto-plastic inclusions.
  Part 1: Plane problems</title>
    <summary>  In this work a novel approach is presented for the isogeometric Boundary
Element analysis of domains that contain inclusions with different elastic
properties than the ones used for computing the fundamental solutions. In
addition the inclusion may exhibit inelastic material behavior. In this paper
only plane stress/strain problems are considered.
  In our approach the geometry of the inclusion is described using NURBS basis
functions. The advantage over currently used methods is that no discretization
into cells is required in order to evaluate the arising volume integrals. The
other difference to current approaches is that Kernels of lower singularity are
used in the domain term. The implementation is verified on simple finite and
infinite domain examples with various boundary conditions. Finally a practical
application in geomechanics is presented.

    <title>A multiscale framework for the simulation of the anisotropic mechanical
  behavior of shale</title>
    <summary>  Shale, like many other sedimentary rocks, is typically heterogeneous,
anisotropic, and is characterized by partial alignment of anisotropic clay
minerals and naturally formed bedding planes. In this study, a micromechanical
framework based on the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) is formulated to
capture these features. Material anisotropy is introduced through an
approximated geometric description of shale internal structure, which includes
representation of material property variation with orientation and explicit
modeling of parallel lamination. The model is calibrated by carrying out
numerical simulations to match various experimental data, including the ones
relevant to elastic properties, Brazilian tensile strength, and unconfined
compressive strength. Furthermore, parametric study is performed to investigate
the relationship between the mesoscale parameters and the macroscopic
properties. It is shown that the dependence of the elastic stiffness, strength,
and failure mode on loading orientation can be captured successfully. Finally,
a homogenization approach based on the asymptotic expansion of field variables
is applied to upscale the proposed micromechanical model, and the properties of
the homogenized model are analyzed.

the monotonic increasing function is proposed in sense of Caputo type. The
properties in term of the Laplace and Fourier transforms are analyzed and the

    <title>A finite-strain hyperviscoplastic model and undrained triaxial tests of
  peat</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a finite-strain hyperviscoplastic constitutive model
within a thermodynamically consistent framework for peat which was categorised
as a material with both rate-dependent and thermodynamic equilibrium hysteresis
based on the data reported in the literature. The model was implemented
numerically using implicit time integration and verified against analytical
solutions under simplified conditions. Experimental studies on the undrained
relaxation and loading-unloading-reloading behaviour of an undisturbed fibrous
peat were carried out to define the thermodynamic equilibrium state during
deviatoric loading as a prerequisite for further modelling, to fit particularly
those model parameters related to solid matrix properties, and to validate the
proposed model under undrained conditions. This validation performed by
comparison to experimental results showed that the hyperviscoplastic model
could simulate undrained triaxial compression tests carried out at five
different strain rates with loading/unloading relaxation steps.

    <title>Computational multiscale methods for linear heterogeneous poroelasticity</title>
    <summary>  We consider a strongly heterogeneous medium saturated by an incompressible
viscous fluid as it appears in geomechanical modeling. This poroelasticity
problem suffers from rapidly oscillating material parameters, which calls for a
thorough numerical treatment. In this paper, we propose a method based on the
local orthogonal decomposition technique and motivated by a similar approach
used for linear thermoelasticity. Therein, local corrector problems are
constructed in line with the static equations, whereas we propose to consider
the full system. This allows to benefit from the given saddle point structure
and results in two decoupled corrector problems for the displacement and the
pressure. We prove the optimal first-order convergence of this method and
verify the result by numerical experiments.

    <title>An evaluation of the osmotic method of controlling suction</title>
    <summary>  Experimental techniques of testing the mechanical properties of unsaturated
soils are complex and difficult to conduct. As a consequence, complete sets of
parameters that characterise the behaviour of unsaturated soils remain scarce
and necessary. In this context, it has been found useful to gather the
information obtained after some years of practice of the osmotic technique of
controlling suction. As compared to the more documented axis-translation
technique, the osmotic technique has its own advantages and drawbacks that are
discussed in this paper, together with some potential future developments. The
osmotic method has been developed by soil scientists in the 1960s and adapted
to geotechnical testing in the early 1970s. This paper presents the osmotic
technique and comments on its advantages (including suction condition close to
reality and higher suctions easily attained) and drawbacks (including some
concern with the membrane resistance and some membrane effects in the
suction/concentration calibration). Various applications to geotechnical
testing are presented such as the determination of the water retention curve,
oedometer and triaxial testing procedures and the determination of the
permeability of unsaturated soils. Recent developments, that include the
extension of the method up to high suctions (10 MPa) are also described,
together with some recent and novel applications such as data from high
controlled suction oedometer compression test and the determination of the
oil/water retention properties of oil reservoir chalks.

    <title>Modeling seismic wave propagation and amplification in 1D/2D/3D linear
  and nonlinear unbounded media</title>
    <summary>  To analyze seismic wave propagation in geological structures, it is possible
to consider various numerical approaches: the finite difference method, the
spectral element method, the boundary element method, the finite element
method, the finite volume method, etc. All these methods have various
advantages and drawbacks. The amplification of seismic waves in surface soil
layers is mainly due to the velocity contrast between these layers and,
possibly, to topographic effects around crests and hills. The influence of the
geometry of alluvial basins on the amplification process is also know to be
large. Nevertheless, strong heterogeneities and complex geometries are not easy
to take into account with all numerical methods. 2D/3D models are needed in
many situations and the efficiency/accuracy of the numerical methods in such
cases is in question. Furthermore, the radiation conditions at infinity are not
easy to handle with finite differences or finite/spectral elements whereas it
is explicitely accounted in the Boundary Element Method. Various absorbing
layer methods (e.g. F-PML, M-PML) were recently proposed to attenuate the
spurious wave reflections especially in some difficult cases such as shallow
numerical models or grazing incidences. Finally, strong earthquakes involve
nonlinear effects in surficial soil layers. To model strong ground motion, it
is thus necessary to consider the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of soils and
simultaneously investigate seismic wave propagation in complex 2D/3D geological
structures! Recent advances in numerical formulations and constitutive models
in such complex situations are presented and discussed in this paper. A crucial
issue is the availability of the field/laboratory data to feed and validate
such models.

    <title>Network Theory, Cracking and Frictional Sliding</title>
    <summary>  We have developed different network approaches to complex patterns of
frictional interfaces (contact areas developments). Here, we analyze the
dynamics of static friction. We found, under the correlation measure, the
fraction of triangles correlates with the detachment fronts. Also, for all
types of the loops (such as triangles), there is a universal power law between
nodes' degree and motifs where motifs frequency follow a power law. This shows
high energy localization is characterized by fast variation of the loops
fraction. Also, this proves that the congestion of loops occurs around hubs.
Furthermore, the motif distributions and modularity space of networks -in terms
of within-module degree and participation coefficient- show universal trends,
indicating an in common aspect of energy flow in shear ruptures. Moreover, we
confirmed that slow ruptures generally hold small localization, while regular
ruptures carry a high level of energy localization. We proposed that
assortativity, as an index to correlation of node's degree, can uncover
acoustic features of the interfaces. We showed that increasing assortativity
induces a nearly silent period of fault's activities. Also, we proposed that
slow ruptures resulted from within-module developments rather than
extra-modules of the networks. Our approach presents a completely new
perspective of the evolution of shear ruptures.

    <title>Fracture Propagation Driven by Fluid Outflow from a Low-permeability
  Aquifer</title>
    <summary>  Deep saline aquifers are promising geological reservoirs for CO2
sequestration if they do not leak. The absence of leakage is provided by the
caprock integrity. However, CO2 injection operations may change the
geomechanical stresses and cause fracturing of the caprock. We present a model
for the propagation of a fracture in the caprock driven by the outflow of fluid
from a low-permeability aquifer. We show that to describe the fracture
propagation, it is necessary to solve the pressure diffusion problem in the
aquifer. We solve the problem numerically for the two-dimensional domain and
show that, after a relatively short time, the solution is close to that of
one-dimensional problem, which can be solved analytically. We use the relations
derived in the hydraulic fracture literature to relate the the width of the
fracture to its length and the flux into it, which allows us to obtain an
analytical expression for the fracture length as a function of time. Using
these results we predict the propagation of a hypothetical fracture at the In
Salah CO2 injection site to be as fast as a typical hydraulic fracture. We also
show that the hydrostatic and geostatic effects cause the increase of the
driving force for the fracture propagation and, therefore, our solution serves
as an estimate from below. Numerical estimates show that if a fracture appears,
it is likely that it will become a pathway for CO2 leakage.

    <title>Rock physics and geophysics for unconventional resource, multi-component
  seismic, quantitative interpretation</title>
    <summary>  An extension of a previously developed rock physics model is made that
quantifies the relationship between the ductile fraction of a brittle/ductile
binary mixture and the isotropic seismic reflection response. By making a weak
scattering (Born) approximation and plane wave (eikonal) approximation, with a
subsequent ordering according to the angle of incidence, singular value
decomposition analysis are done to understand the stack weightings, number of
stacks, and the type of stacks that will optimally estimate the two fundamental
rock physics parameters. Through this angle ordering, it is found that
effective wavelets can be used for the stacks up to second order. Finally, it
is concluded that the full PP stack and the "full" PS stack are the two optimal
stacks needed to estimate the two rock physics parameters. They dominate over
both the second order AVO "gradient" stack and the higher order (4th order) PP
stack (even at large angles of incidence). Using this result and model based
Bayesian inversion, the detectability of the ductile fraction (shown by others
to be the important quantity for the geomechanical response of unconventional
reservoir fracking) is demonstrated on a model characteristic of the Marcellus
shale play.

    <title>On the capillary stress tensor in wet granular materials</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a micromechanical study of unsaturated granular media in
the pendular regime, based upon numerical experiments using the discrete
element method, compared to a microstructural elastoplastic model. Water
effects are taken into account by adding capillary menisci at contacts and
their consequences in terms of force and water volume are studied. Simulations
of triaxial compression tests are used to investigate both macro and
micro-effects of a partial saturation. The results provided by the two methods
appear to be in good agreement, reproducing the major trends of a partially
saturated granular assembly, such as the increase in the shear strength and the
hardening with suction. Moreover, a capillary stress tensor is exhibited from
capillary forces by using homogenisation techniques. Both macroscopic and
microscopic considerations emphasize an induced anisotropy of the capillary
stress tensor in relation with the pore fluid distribution inside the material.
In so far as the tensorial nature of this fluid fabric implies shear effects on
the solid phase associated with suction, a comparison has been made with the
standard equivalent pore pressure assumption. It is shown that water effects
induce microstrural phenomena that cannot be considered at the macro level,
particularly when dealing with material history. Thus, the study points out
that unsaturated soil stress definitions should include, besides the
macroscopic stresses such as the total stress, the microscopic interparticle
stresses such as the ones resulting from capillary forces, in order to
interpret more precisely the implications of the pore fluid on the mechanical
behaviour of granular materials.

    <title>Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) for pressure-dependent
  inelasticity in granular rocks</title>
    <summary>  This paper deals with the formulation, calibration, and validation of a
Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) for the simulation of the
pressure-dependent inelastic response of granular rocks. LDPM is formulated in
the framework of discrete mechanics and it simulates the heterogeneous
deformation of cemented granular systems by means of discrete
compatibility/equilibrium equations defined at the grain scale. A numerical
strategy is proposed to generate a realistic microstructure based on the actual
grain size distribution of a sandstone and the capabilities of the method are
illustrated with reference to the particular case of Bleurswiller sandstone,
i.e. a granular rock that has been extensively studied at the laboratory scale.
LDPM micromechanical parameters are calibrated based on evidences from triaxial
experiments, such as hydrostatic compression, brittle failure at low
confinement and plastic behavior at high confinement. Results show that LDPM
allows exploring the effect of fine-scale heterogeneity on the inelastic
response of rock cores, achieving excellent quantitative performance across a
wide range of stress conditions. In addition, LDPM simulations demonstrate its
capability of capturing different modes of strain localization within a unified
mechanical framework, which makes this approach applicable for a wide variety
of geomechanical settings. Such promising performance suggests that LDPM may
constitute a viable alternative to existing discrete numerical methods for
granular rocks, as well as a versatile tool for the interpretation of their
complex deformation/failure patterns and for the development of continuum
models capturing the effect of micro-scale heterogeneity.

    <title>Collapses of underground cavities and soil-structure interactions:
  influences of the position of the structure relative to the cavity</title>
    <summary>  This paper is focused on soil subsidence of small extend and amplitude caused
by tunnel boring or the collapse of underground cavities, whether natural or
man-made. The impact of the movements of the ground on existing structures is
generally dramatic. It is therefore necessary to accurately predict these
movements (settlements and horizontal extension or compression displacements).
Even though it is obvious that the overall stiffness and weight of the
structure influences the size and shape of the soil movement, the main features
of this soil-structure interaction phenomenon are not well established. Caudron
et al. (2006) developed an original small-scale physical model to take the
soil-structure interaction into account. It is based on the use of the
frictional Schneebeli material (assembly of small diameter rods) and a modified
version including cohesion in order to reproduce a cohesive layer above a
cavity. The displacements of the soil are obtained from digital images
processing by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Interesting results were
obtained, probing that the soil-structure interactions could be analysed by
this experimental model. This article is focused in a first part on the
influence of the position of the structure with respect to the cavity position.
Consequences on the areas mainly concerned by horizontal compression or
extension of the structure are determined. It appears that the stresses induced
in the building are a superposition of several elementary loading (sum of the
effects of the slope, the horizontal deformations and the curvature). The
second part concerns the effect of the relative soil/structure stiffness on the
ground movement during a cavity collapse by considering a second model of
structure with similar dimensions but more flexible.

    <title>Large deformations of a soft porous material</title>
    <summary>  Compressing a porous material will decrease the volume of the pore space,
driving fluid out. Similarly, injecting fluid into a porous material can expand
the pore space, distorting the solid skeleton. This poromechanical coupling has
applications ranging from tissue mechanics to hydrogeology. The classical
theory of linear poroelasticity captures this coupling by combining Darcy's law
with Terzaghi's effective stress and linear elasticity in a linearized
kinematic framework. Linear poroelasticity is a good model for very small
deformations, but it becomes increasingly inappropriate for moderate to large
deformations, which are common in the context of phenomena such as swelling and
damage, and for soft materials such as gels and tissues. The well-known theory
of large-deformation poroelasticity combines Darcy's law with Terzaghi's
effective stress and nonlinear elasticity in a rigorous kinematic framework.
This theory has been used extensively in biomechanics to model large elastic
deformations in soft tissues, and in geomechanics to model large elastoplastic
deformations in soils. Here, we first provide an overview and discussion of
this theory with an emphasis on the physics of poromechanical coupling. We
present the large-deformation theory in an Eulerian framework to minimize the
mathematical complexity, and we show how this nonlinear theory simplifies to
linear poroelasticity under the assumption of small strain. We then compare the
predictions of linear poroelasticity with those of large-deformation
poroelasticity in the context of two uniaxial model problems: Fluid outflow
driven by an applied mechanical load (the consolidation problem) and
compression driven by a steady fluid throughflow. We use these problems to
explore the steady and dynamical errors associated with the linear model in
both situations, as well as the impact of introducing a deformation-dependent
permeability.
